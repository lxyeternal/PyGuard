  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or data flows.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and does not contain issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple class with no hidden or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or contain any suspicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** No elevated risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not include any malicious payloads or behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities or threats are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 — no security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the existing assessments. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless custom exception class.\n- All scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
