  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nclass UnsupportedWebDriverException(Exception):\n    pass\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a simple class definition for a custom exception.\n- No data input/output, no external dependencies, no logic beyond inheritance.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is standard: to define a specific exception class for unsupported WebDriver errors.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5**:\n- All reports uniformly state that the code is a straightforward class definition.\n- They mention no data flows, no data leaks, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- All assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n- Their conclusions are consistent and reasonable given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None. The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Scores assessment:**\n  - **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n  - **Security risk:** Correctly 0, no security concerns.\n\n### Potential adjustments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.\n- The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive, and I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of security or malicious concerns. No further action or concern is warranted.",
