  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the class is a simple exception definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, minimal, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from Exception with a pass statement. It contains no data handling, external calls, or suspicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The code serves a clear purpose as a custom exception and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
