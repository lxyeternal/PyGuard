  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is a simple class definition: `class UnsupportedWebDriverException(Exception): pass`.\n   - All reports agree that there are no data flows, inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward exception class with no malicious or security-related concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a securityRisk of 0, and the code is a simple exception class, this is appropriate.\n   - No risk scores should be elevated based on the current evidence.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic, network calls, or obfuscated elements.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a minimal, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- No issues detected.\n- All scores are appropriate.\n- The code poses no security threat or malware risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
