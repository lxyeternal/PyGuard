  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward class definition of a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No input/output, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no security concerns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The risk scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is not malicious.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity of the code, the overall assessment confirms a safe and benign component.",
