  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages import paths for testing purposes. It uses standard library functions to determine directory paths and conditionally modifies sys.path. No dynamic code execution, external network interactions, or obfuscated logic are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for test setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a utility for setting up test environment paths and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
