  "purpose": "Provide helper tools for unit tests by managing import paths.",
  "sources": "Reading the file path of the current script via __file__, accessing os.path and sys modules.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path to include test and code directories.",
  "flows": "__file__ → os.path functions → sys.path modifications",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up environment for unit testing by dynamically adding directories to sys.path, using standard library modules. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. No code injection or unsafe practices are evident. The licensing comments and structure are typical for open-source Python code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper script for managing import paths in tests, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
