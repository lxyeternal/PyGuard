  "purpose": "Provides helper tools for unit tests, specifically manipulating the sys.path for test and code directories.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine current file location, os.path functions for path resolution, sys.path for module import paths",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path to influence module import behavior",
  "flows": "The code reads __file__ to determine directories, then conditionally inserts these directories into sys.path",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network operations",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and typical for test setup. It determines directory paths relative to the current file and ensures they are in sys.path for module import. No external input handling, no untrusted data processing, no obfuscated or malicious code. It simply adjusts the module search path for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a setup script for tests by adjusting import paths. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
