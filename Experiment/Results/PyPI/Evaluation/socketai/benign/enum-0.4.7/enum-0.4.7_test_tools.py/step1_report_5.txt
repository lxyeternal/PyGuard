  "purpose": "Provide helper tools for unit tests in the 'enum' package, mainly setting up the environment for testing.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file location (__file__), accessing sys.path to modify module search paths.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; code only modifies sys.path based on file locations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code simply manipulates sys.path based on known file locations.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes directory paths for testing and modifies sys.path to include these directories if they are not already included. It does not perform any network operations, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data. The script is purely for setting up the test environment. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for test setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
