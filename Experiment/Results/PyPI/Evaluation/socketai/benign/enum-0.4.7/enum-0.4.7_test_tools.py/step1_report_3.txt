  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory and path information via os.path and sys modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly internal path manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
