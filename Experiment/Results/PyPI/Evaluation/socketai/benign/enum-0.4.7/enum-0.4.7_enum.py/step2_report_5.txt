  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard enumeration utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, risk = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The high confidence (1.0) aligns with the code's clarity and safety.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe, standard implementation without external dependencies or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns. The confidence is 1.0, justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward, safe enum implementation with no external data or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. Confidence slightly below 1.0 (0.9), perhaps due to slight uncertainty, but overall safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard enum code with proper safeguards and no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0 — the slight risk score may be due to the general caution in static code analysis, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.1 seems marginally high given the code's nature. No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities justifies a higher risk. I suggest lowering it to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard, safe enum implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- All reports describe a benign, well-structured enumeration utility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling.\n- The only minor inconsistency is the risk score in Report 4, which is set at 0.1 despite no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe enumeration implementation with no security risks or malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate, except for the slight risk in Report 4, which should be lowered to 0.0.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed report summary or further analysis.",
