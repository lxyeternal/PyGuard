{
  "purpose": "Provides robust enumerated types for Python, allowing creation of immutable, comparable enum values with string keys and indices.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string arguments during Enum creation, and internal attribute access for enum values.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Enum constructor initializes enum values from static keys; no external data flows or untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no external command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard enum pattern with clear structure, no external data handling, and no malicious behavior. The exception classes and comparison operators are standard. The enum values are immutable and only involve internal data. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured enumeration utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use, and the scores should reflect zero malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
