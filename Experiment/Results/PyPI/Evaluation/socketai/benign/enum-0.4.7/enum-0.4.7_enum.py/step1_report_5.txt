{
  "purpose": "The code provides a robust implementation of enumerated types in Python, allowing creation and comparison of enum values.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments during Enum creation; accesses class attributes for enum values.",
  "sinks": "Uses string representations and attribute access, which are safe; no unsafe sinks like network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Enumeration keys are used to generate EnumValue instances, which are then stored as immutable attributes; comparison methods operate on internal indices.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. All code appears to implement standard enum functionality with appropriate error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions, an EnumValue class for individual enum members, and an Enum class for creating immutable enumerations. It employs standard practices, such as preventing modification of enum instances and validating input keys. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The license and author info are standard. The comparison methods are properly decorated, and the enum values are stored in an immutable manner. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured, benign implementation of enum types with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented enum module with no malicious intent or malicious code segments detected. It functions as intended for defining enumerations securely.",
