{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python module for creating and managing enumerated types, enabling the definition of immutable sets of named constants.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for enumeration keys, module metadata, and attribute access within classes. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed, transmitted, or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static enumeration key definitions through class instantiations and attribute assignments. No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted inputs exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. It follows standard patterns for defining enumerations and custom exceptions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The module defines custom exceptions and an Enum class to create immutable enumerations. It uses standard Python features such as properties, class attributes, and exception handling. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or other potentially malicious activities are present. The code appears to be a well-structured, open-source enumeration utility with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate enumeration implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as intended for safe enumeration creation and management.",
