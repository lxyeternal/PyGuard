{
  "purpose": "Provide a robust enumerated type implementation for Python, allowing creation and comparison of enumerations.",
  "sources": "Reading module-level metadata, class definitions, method implementations, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Comparison operators (__eq__, __ne__, __lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__), string representations (__str__, __repr__), and attribute access (__getattr__).",
  "flows": "Input data (enum keys) flows through constructor to create EnumValue instances; comparison and string conversion methods use internal attributes (index, key).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as network activity, file access, or hidden payloads; no hardcoded secrets or external calls; exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration module with classes for enum creation (Enum) and enum values (EnumValue). It enforces immutability and type checks, with no external data access or modification. Exception classes are for validation errors. Comparison methods ensure type safety. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The code primarily manipulates internal data structures and provides standard enumeration features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of enumeration types in Python, with standard features and exception handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The security risk is minimal.",
