  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard enumeration utility with no malicious behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Confidence = 1.0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a typical enum implementation with no external data or malicious actions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is described as a legitimate enum utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence but still aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** The report notes that the code uses comparison operators and attribute access but finds no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The minor security risk score (0.1) might reflect a cautious stance on comparison operators, but these are standard for enum classes. No actual malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard enum implementation with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher in Report 4 (0.1), but given the code's features, this is a conservative estimate and can be justified as minimal.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear, well-structured, and readable.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.0–0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the comparison operators, but not genuinely risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented enumeration utility with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the assessments are accurate.",
