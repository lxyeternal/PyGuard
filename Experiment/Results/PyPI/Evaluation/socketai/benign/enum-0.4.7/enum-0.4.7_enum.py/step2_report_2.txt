  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues found; code is a standard enum implementation.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely for enumeration; no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code. No modifications needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard enum pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the description.\n- **Justification:** No external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; static enum definitions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, matching the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No external influence or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard enum features.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1 — the slight security risk might reflect a conservative approach, but given the code's nature, it's minimal.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the small security risk might be due to the general potential for misuse in some contexts, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a very low security risk score.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; typical enum code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent.\n- **Justification:** No external or malicious operations.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Most are 0, with one at 0.1, which is acceptable given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-structured, open-source enumeration utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
