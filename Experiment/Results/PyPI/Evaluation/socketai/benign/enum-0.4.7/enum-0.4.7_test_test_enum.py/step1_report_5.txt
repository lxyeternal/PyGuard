  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'enum' module, including tests for enum values, attributes, and exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, test setup functions, and test case methods that access module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code flows from imports and setup functions to various test methods that validate module attributes and behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code is purely testing-related, with no system or network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the 'enum' module, verifying attribute existence, immutability, comparison operations, and exception handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The import of 'tools' is unused, but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior was identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code for a Python module, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs typical unit testing functions without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
