{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive unit test suite for the 'enum' module, verifying attributes, behaviors, and exception handling of enum classes and values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from internally defined fixtures and mock objects; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into system effects or data leaks; no network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve internal method calls and assertions within the test cases, with no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The 'tools' import is unused but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of unit tests for the 'enum' module, with no network, file, or environment interactions. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The tests verify class attributes, comparison operators, immutability, and exception handling. The code is static and straightforward, following common testing practices. No suspicious patterns or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate test suite with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
