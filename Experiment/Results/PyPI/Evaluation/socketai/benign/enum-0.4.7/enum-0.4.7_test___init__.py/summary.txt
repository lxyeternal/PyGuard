  "malware_score": 0.15,
  "security_risk": 0.25,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with some obfuscation and dynamic features that warrant cautious monitoring. No definitive malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation justifies a slight elevation in security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware likelihood and moderate suspicion due to obfuscation."
