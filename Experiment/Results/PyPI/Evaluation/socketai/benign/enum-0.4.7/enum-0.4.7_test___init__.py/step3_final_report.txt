  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs from environment variables, user inputs, network connections, or file operations; dynamic code execution functions such as eval or exec.",
  "sinks": "Network communications, file system modifications, environment variable access, or system commands that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, file, system), potentially via dynamic execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code segments, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which raise suspicion but lack concrete evidence of malicious payloads. No hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity are detected. The overall structure suggests potential for misuse but no active malicious behavior. The suspicion level justifies a low malware score with moderate security risk due to obfuscation concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with some obfuscation and dynamic features that warrant cautious monitoring. No definitive malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation justifies a slight elevation in security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware likelihood and moderate suspicion due to obfuscation.",
