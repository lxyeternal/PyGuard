  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'enum' Python package, used for package installation and distribution configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools' and 'main_module' attributes such as '__version__', '__author_name__', '__author_email__', '__license__', and '__url__' from the 'enum' module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks or external systems.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flows; information from the 'enum' module attributes is used for package metadata and printed in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a long description string that is prefixed with a deprecation warning, but this is normal for package metadata. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, importing necessary modules and defining metadata. It retrieves version and author info from the 'enum' module and constructs a long description with a deprecation notice. The use of 'setuptools' for packaging is typical. No external input or dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior are observed. All code appears legitimate and consistent with standard setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It retrieves metadata from the package module and configures distribution parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
