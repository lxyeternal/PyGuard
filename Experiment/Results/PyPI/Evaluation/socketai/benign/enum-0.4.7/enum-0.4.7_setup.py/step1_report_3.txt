{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'enum'.",
  "sources": "Reads module metadata (__version__, __author_name__, __author_email__, __license__, __url__, __doc__), imports setup-related functions, and reads the main module to obtain documentation and version info.",
  "sinks": "Uses module attributes and setup() parameters, which are standard and do not handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "Module metadata is read from the main module and passed directly to setup(); no external input flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup script. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script for Python packaging. It imports metadata from the main module and constructs the package configuration. The long_description is prefixed with a deprecation notice, and metadata fields are populated directly from the module attributes. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The script does not perform any operations that could compromise security or contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures the package distribution parameters using static module attributes and standard setup procedures.",
