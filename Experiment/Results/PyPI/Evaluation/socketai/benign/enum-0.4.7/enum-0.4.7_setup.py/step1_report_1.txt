  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'enum' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading main_module attributes (__version__, __author_name__, __author_email__, __license__, __url__, __doc__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions observed.",
  "flows": "Source: importing main_module and accessing its attributes -> used in setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning indicating the package is superseded; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools. It dynamically imports the main module to retrieve version and author information, which is typical. The deprecation message is a harmless string prepended to the long description. No user input handling, network activity, or executable code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a conventional setup script with no signs of malicious code or sabotage. It primarily configures package metadata and includes a deprecation notice. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
