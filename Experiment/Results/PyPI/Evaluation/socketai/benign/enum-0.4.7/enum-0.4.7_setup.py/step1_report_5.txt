  "purpose": "Setup script for distributing the 'enum' Python package, defining package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and find_packages, reading version and documentation attributes from the main module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input; the script mainly defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from sources to sinks indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of decode('utf-8') on __doc__, which could raise an exception if __doc__ is not a byte string, but this is typical and not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup file. It imports package information from the main module and constructs descriptive strings for package description, including a deprecation notice. There are no network connections, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input. The code adheres to common packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. It follows typical conventions and contains no suspicious or harmful code.",
