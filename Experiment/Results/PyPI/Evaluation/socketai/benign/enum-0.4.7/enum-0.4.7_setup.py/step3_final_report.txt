  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'enum' library, retrieving metadata from the main module and configuring package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads attributes (__version__, __author_name__, __author_email__, __license__, __url__, __doc__) from the main module; static strings for description and license.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no network or file operations; data flows only from trusted module attributes into setup().",
  "flows": "Module attributes (version, author, email, license, URL, documentation) flow into setup() parameters; description constructed from module docstring.",
  "anomalies": "Use of decode('utf-8') on __doc__ may raise an exception if __doc__ is already a string in Python 3, but this is a minor implementation detail, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py for packaging a Python library. It imports metadata from the main module, constructs a long description with a deprecation notice, and calls setuptools.setup() with standard parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The only minor concern is the decode() call on __doc__, which could cause runtime errors if __doc__ is not bytes, but this does not indicate malicious intent. All indicators point to benign, standard packaging code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
