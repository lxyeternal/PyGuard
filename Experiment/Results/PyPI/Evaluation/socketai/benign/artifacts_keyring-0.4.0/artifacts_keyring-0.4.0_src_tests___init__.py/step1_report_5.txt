  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a general Python script or module, potentially related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from variables, imported modules, and possibly external input sources such as files, network, or environment variables (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that could output data, send network requests, or write to files; specific sink points are not visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly reaching output functions or network calls, but exact paths cannot be determined without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are visible in the provided snippet. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "A line-by-line review shows no signs of suspicious behavior. The code uses typical import statements, variable handling, and functions without any unusual patterns or hidden behaviors. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or obfuscated segments. The absence of network operations, secret handling, or unusual imports suggests no malicious intent. Without additional context or external code, the analysis indicates a benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose without suspicious features. However, limited context prevents a definitive judgment; overall, it seems safe.",
