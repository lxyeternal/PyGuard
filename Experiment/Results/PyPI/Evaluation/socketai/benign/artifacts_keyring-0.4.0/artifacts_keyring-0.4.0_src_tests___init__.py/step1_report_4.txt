  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly intended for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context provided.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, user inputs, and imported modules that could receive external data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file write operations, or execution of dynamic code that could lead to data leakage or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like file writes or network calls, possibly via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The code structure appears typical with no obfuscated sections or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard library imports, no suspicious network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets. The code lacks any overt malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert channels. The overall structure suggests legitimate functionality, although lack of explicit context limits full certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no detected malware or security issues. Confidence in this assessment is high given the clarity and typical structure of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
