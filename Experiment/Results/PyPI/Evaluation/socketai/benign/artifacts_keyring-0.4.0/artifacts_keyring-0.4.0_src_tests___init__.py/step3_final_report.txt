  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security risks of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include dynamic code execution, network data handling, environment variables, and file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into eval/exec, network connections, file writes, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or data flow into eval/exec or network functions, leading to potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution functions, network activity with untrusted data, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively indicate that most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, supported by high confidence assessments. Report 3 uniquely suggests signs of malicious behavior, including dynamic code execution and network activity, justifying higher malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.6), and security risk (0.75) scores. The other reports consistently show no suspicious patterns, aligning their scores with their conclusions. Overall, the evidence supports a low to moderate security concern, with Report 3 warranting closer scrutiny if such features are confirmed in the actual code. The scores are appropriate given the descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary unless further static or dynamic analysis reveals hidden malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency's code is predominantly benign, with only Report 3 indicating potential malicious features justified by signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution. The overall risk remains low, but vigilance is advised if suspicious code features are confirmed.",
