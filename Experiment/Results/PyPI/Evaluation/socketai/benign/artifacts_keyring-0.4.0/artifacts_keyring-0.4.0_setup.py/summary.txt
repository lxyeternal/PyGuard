  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious and shows no obfuscation; however, it lacks validation for the downloaded archive, posing a supply chain security risk. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0. The security risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting moderate concern due to unverified external content, which could be exploited if the URL or content is compromised."
