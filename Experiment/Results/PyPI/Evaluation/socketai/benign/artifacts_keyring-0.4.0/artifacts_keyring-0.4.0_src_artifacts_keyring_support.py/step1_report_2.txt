  "purpose": "Helper module for Azure DevOps Keyring, providing imports and compatibility for URL splitting and subprocess management.",
  "sources": "Import statements for urlsplit and subprocess.Popen, including fallback for older Python versions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes compatibility layers for Python 2 and 3, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior detected. No obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages import compatibility and extends Popen to support context management in Python 2. The fallback classes and import logic are standard techniques. No input handling, no data processing, and no external network interactions are present. The code's structure and content are typical for cross-version compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be standard compatibility boilerplate code with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.",
