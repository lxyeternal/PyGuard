{
  "purpose": "Define and organize custom exception and warning classes used throughout the Pywikibot framework to handle various error conditions systematically.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structures; error message strings; regular expressions used in exception initialization; import statements.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings and formatted messages used in exceptions; potentially sensitive info in error reports.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with specific parameters leading to error message generation and raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, or suspicious data leaks observed. Use of string formatting for error messages is standard and not suspicious. No dynamic code execution or external input handling within this code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for a comprehensive hierarchy of exception and warning types. These classes encapsulate different error scenarios encountered in the Pywikibot framework, with some dynamic message formatting. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The regular expression is used only for message formatting within the class, which is standard practice. The import statements and class structures do not suggest malicious intent. Usage of deprecation wrappers and error message strings aligns with normal framework maintenance and error handling procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a structured exception and warning hierarchy for error handling in Pywikibot. There is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The implementation is standard and adheres to good practices for exception management. Overall security risk is minimal.",
