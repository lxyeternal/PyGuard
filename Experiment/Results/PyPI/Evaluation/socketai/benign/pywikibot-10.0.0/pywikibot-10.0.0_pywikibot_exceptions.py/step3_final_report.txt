{
  "purpose": "Defines a comprehensive hierarchy of exception and warning classes used throughout the Pywikibot framework for structured error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, message formatting strings, regex for placeholder detection, deprecation wrappers.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes occurs during error conditions; no external data flow or malicious payloads involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex in PageRelatedError.__init__ to detect placeholders is benign; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings, employing standard Python inheritance and message formatting. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling is present. The regex usage is limited to message formatting checks and is safe. The deprecation wrapper is a standard maintenance practice. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured, standard exception hierarchy for the Pywikibot framework. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) accurately reflects its benign nature.",
