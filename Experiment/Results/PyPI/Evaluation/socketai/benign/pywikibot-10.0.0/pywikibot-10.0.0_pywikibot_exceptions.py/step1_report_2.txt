  "purpose": "Define and organize exception and warning classes used throughout the Pywikibot framework for handling various errors, warnings, and specific site/page issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, import statements, and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__ and __repr__) of exceptions; formatted messages that include page titles, URLs, or other data.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising lead to formatted message generation, but no untrusted data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. All code pertains to error handling, with no code injection, network communication, or data exfiltration logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings, with no active or executable logic beyond message formatting. The message properties dynamically generate strings for debugging or user display, but do not involve untrusted input sources or system calls. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The module is designed for structured error handling within the Pywikibot framework and does not perform any external or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of exception classes used for error reporting within a larger application. There is no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard error handling module with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
