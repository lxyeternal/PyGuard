{
  "purpose": "This code defines a hierarchy of exception and warning classes for the Pywikibot framework, primarily for handling various errors related to media wiki operations, page handling, server responses, and user rights.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and imports at the top of the file; exception initialization methods; message string formatting; usage of imported modules such as 're' and 'pywikibot'.",
  "sinks": "None of the exception classes or methods perform data writes or external communications directly; no untrusted input sources or network operations are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Class instantiations occur with specific parameters (e.g., page objects, error info) that are used to format messages, but these flows are limited to in-memory exception handling and do not involve data from untrusted sources or external flows within this module.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for exceptions, with standard message formatting. The only potential anomaly is the use of 're.search' in the PageRelatedError constructor, which checks for format placeholders, but this is a benign operation. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. There is a deprecated class alias for Server414Error pointing to Client414Error, which is standard deprecation practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions for error handling within the Pywikibot framework. It employs standard Python practices for defining custom exceptions, message formatting, and inheritance. The inclusion of warnings and deprecation wrappers indicates maintenance practices. No code performs network operations, data collection, or untrusted data processing that could be malicious. The only minor observation is the re.search check for placeholders in message strings, which is benign. Overall, the code serves as a structured error handling module without any malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a non-malicious, standard implementation of exception and warning classes used for error handling in Pywikibot. No suspicious or malicious code is present, and the code adheres to safe practices. The presence of deprecation handling and comprehensive class definitions indicates good maintenance rather than malicious activity.",
