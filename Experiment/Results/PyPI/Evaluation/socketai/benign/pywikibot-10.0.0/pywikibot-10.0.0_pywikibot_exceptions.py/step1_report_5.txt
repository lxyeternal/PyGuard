{
  "purpose": "Defines exception and warning classes used throughout the Pywikibot framework for error handling and signaling various conditions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and method implementations within the module.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of exception classes, string formatting in error messages, and potential logging if integrated externally.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised in response to specific error conditions; messages are formatted with page data and error details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections; use of standard exception patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation; deprecation wrapper for class aliasing, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with clear, documented messages. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data leaks. Error handling is straightforward, using standard Python features. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of regex in PageRelatedError is benign and for message formatting purposes. The deprecation wrapper indicates version management but is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured, conventional error-handling module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception and warning class module for the Pywikibot framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. It simply defines error types with informative messages for use throughout the larger application.",
