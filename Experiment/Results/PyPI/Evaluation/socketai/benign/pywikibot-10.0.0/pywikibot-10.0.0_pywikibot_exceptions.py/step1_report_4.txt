{
  "purpose": "Define a comprehensive set of exception and warning classes used throughout the Pywikibot framework for error handling and notifications.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, imports, and docstrings. No external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and exception raising are standard and do not involve data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious import patterns, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is primarily class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines custom exception and warning classes for various error conditions within the Pywikibot framework, including API errors, page errors, server errors, and user warnings. It includes detailed inheritance structures, message templates, and some deprecated attribute handling via ModuleDeprecationWrapper. The implementation appears standard, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. All classes serve as structured error representations, and there is no evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of structured class definitions for error handling within the Pywikibot framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It functions as intended for exception management, with no indications of hidden or harmful code.",
