  "purpose": "Static dictionary-based implementation of language pluralization rules, used for localization purposes.",
  "sources": "Static data structures defining language rules; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static mappings and lambda functions operate independently without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static data, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pluralization rules for various languages using static dictionaries and lambda functions. It contains no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The lambda functions implement language-specific numeric conditions for plural forms. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only minor point is the securityRisk score in one report (0.1), which is an overestimation given the static, benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is a safe, standard localization utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static implementation of language plural rules with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety, with a minor overestimation of security risk in one case. The code should be assigned malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0.",
