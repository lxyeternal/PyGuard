  "purpose": "Define language-specific pluralization rules for internationalization in software, particularly for handling grammatical number forms.",
  "sources": "Static dictionary declarations, lambda functions for plural rules, and imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no handling of untrusted input, data, or external systems occurs.",
  "flows": "The code maps language codes to pluralization rules and retrieves them via the 'plural_rule' function; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The lambda functions are straightforward, and the data structures are static. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static mappings for language codes to pluralization rules, using lambda functions to implement language-specific logic. It imports standard typing modules, utilizes dictionaries for rule storage, and provides a simple accessor function. There is no dynamic code execution, no external data input handling, and no network or system modification operations. The structure and content are consistent with typical i18n utility modules. All functions and data are static, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or code sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard internationalization utility module defining plural rules for various languages. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured and solely uses static data and functions.",
