  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines plural rules with no external inputs, no data sinks, no suspicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, using lambda functions for language-specific rules.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Clearly zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is static, safe, and standard for localization.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, static data, straightforward lambda functions, no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, static mappings, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly noted as 0.1, but this is likely a conservative default or a minor flag, not indicative of real risk.\n- **Assessment:** The slight security risk score seems unwarranted given the static nature. The code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments, static, safe, straightforward.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Zero.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk. The code is purely static data and functions for localization, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The only slight discrepancy is in Report 4, which assigns a 0.1 to security risk. Given the static, benign nature of the code, a risk score of 0.0 is more appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 for all, as the code is static, safe, and standard.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis module is a benign utility for language pluralization rules. It contains no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The lambda functions are simple and serve purely computational purposes. The code's purpose is to support localization, which it does in a safe manner.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
