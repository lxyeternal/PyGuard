  "purpose": "Define pluralization rules for various languages, used to handle linguistic plural forms in localization.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of language codes and associated lambda functions for pluralization logic.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no input/output operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "Code primarily consists of static data structures and lambda functions that perform straightforward numeric comparisons.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines language-specific pluralization rules using static dictionaries and lambda functions for calculations. The rules are based on numeric conditions. No external data inputs, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code appears standard for handling localization plural forms and does not execute any malicious or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured localization utility for pluralization rules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It solely provides static mappings and simple functions for language rules.",
