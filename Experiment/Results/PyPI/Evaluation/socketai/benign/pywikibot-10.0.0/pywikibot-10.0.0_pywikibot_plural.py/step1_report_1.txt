{
  "purpose": "Defines pluralization rules for various languages, allowing localization of text based on numerical quantities.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; the code loads predefined language rules and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines data structures and functions for retrieving rules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a dictionary of language codes mapped to their respective pluralization rules, either as lambda functions or static values. It updates the rules with additional language groups using dictionary methods. The function 'plural_rule' retrieves rules safely. There are no external inputs, no network activity, no command execution, or any form of data handling that could be exploited. The use of lambda functions for plural logic is standard for such a purpose. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of language pluralization rules. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module for localization purposes.",
