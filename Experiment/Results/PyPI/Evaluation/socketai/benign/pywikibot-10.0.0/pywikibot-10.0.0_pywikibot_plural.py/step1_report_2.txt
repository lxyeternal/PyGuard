{
  "purpose": "Defines pluralization rules for various languages using lambda functions and dictionaries to handle language-specific pluralization logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads only its own definitions and imported modules; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, network calls, file operations, or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code defines static data structures and functions without any dynamic data flow or data processing pipelines involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The lambda functions are straightforward and serve purely computational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a dictionary of pluralization rules per language, utilizing lambda functions for language-specific rules. It employs standard Python data structures and safe function definitions. No external input, data, or network interactions are present. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or potential malware behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of language-specific plural rules for localization purposes. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, posing no security threat.",
