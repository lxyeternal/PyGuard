{
  "purpose": "Defines pluralization rules for various languages, used for localization and internationalization.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines data structures and lambda functions internally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing or output to external systems occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "All functions are simple lambda expressions defining language rules; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. No malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints, defines a set of pluralization rules for many languages with associated lambda functions, and provides a function to retrieve these rules. The rules are standard, language-specific pluralization formulas. No external data sources, network operations, or code that could execute arbitrary or malicious actions are present. The structure and logic are straightforward and consistent with typical localization tools. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of language pluralization rules for localization. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The functions and data structures are safe and intended for use in internationalization tasks.",
