  "purpose": "This module provides tools for performing cosmetic and formatting edits on wiki page source code, such as tidying links, headers, references, and other markup elements.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from page objects, regex matching for various wiki syntax elements, site information, and user configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "Modifying page text through regex replacements, creating or removing templates, and editing page content based on patterns; no direct data leaks or external communications are performed.",
  "flows": "Input from page objects flows into various cleaning functions, which process and modify the text using regex and helper functions, then return the cleaned-up text.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive regex-based text processing, which could be misused to manipulate page content in unintended ways. However, no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or system modifications are present. There are no clear backdoors or hidden code segments. The use of regex patterns is complex but legitimate for text processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused entirely on local text manipulation within wiki page source code, employing regex replacements, pattern matching, and text processing functions. There are no network operations, system modifications, or external communications. The logic appears to be standard for a bot designed to clean or tidy wiki pages, with no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is well-structured with clear functions for each cleaning task, using safe exception handling. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found. The extensive regex-based transformations could, in theory, be misused if exploited externally, but in its current form, it functions solely as a text editor for wiki content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive wiki text cleanup toolkit without malicious intent. It performs standard regex-based modifications for formatting and markup correction, with no network activity, external data handling, or system access. Therefore, it poses no malware risk. The overall security risk is very low.",
