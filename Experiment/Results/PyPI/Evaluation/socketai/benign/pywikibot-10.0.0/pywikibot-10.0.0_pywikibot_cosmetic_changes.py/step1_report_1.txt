{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for performing cosmetic edits and cleanup on wiki page source code within the Pywikibot framework.",
  "sources": "User inputs include page content and configuration settings; data is retrieved from the site object, such as namespaces, magic words, and link patterns.",
  "sinks": "Output includes modified page source text after various cleaning functions; no direct data leaks or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Sources (page content and site info) flow into cleanup functions (e.g., fix syntax, links, headers), which then produce sanitized text; no external untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code predominantly contains regexes, text processing, and configuration management. No network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on text manipulation within the Pywikibot framework, implementing various cleanup routines, regex-based replacements, and configuration options. It does not contain code that performs network communication, file system tampering, or privilege escalation. The functions rely on safe, standard Python modules and Pywikibot utilities. No hardcoded secrets, credential theft, or privacy violations are identified. The structure and purpose align with expected automation tasks for wiki page editing, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for cleaning and formatting wiki source text. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe for its intended purpose within the Pywikibot ecosystem.",
