{
  "purpose": "The code provides a toolkit for cleaning and formatting wiki page source text within the Pywikibot framework, performing regex-based modifications to improve readability and consistency without altering page appearance.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from wiki pages, site configurations, and user settings; interacts with site and page objects for context.",
  "sinks": "Outputs modified text; no external data transmission or system modifications; uses regex replacements and text manipulations.",
  "flows": "Source data (page content, site info) flows through regex functions and methods that modify the text, resulting in cleaned or formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious routines detected. Regex patterns are standard and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of functions for content cleanup, including formatting headers, links, references, and removing unnecessary spaces. It relies on regex replacements and site-specific configurations. No network calls, external data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The regex complexity is typical for text processing and does not indicate obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's benign purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for wiki content formatting and cleanup, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score accounts for regex complexity but does not reflect actual threats.",
