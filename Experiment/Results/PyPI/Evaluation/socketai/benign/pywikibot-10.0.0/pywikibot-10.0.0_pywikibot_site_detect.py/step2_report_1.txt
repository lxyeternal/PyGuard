  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code behavior with the report's claims, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches site info, parses HTML for version, server, scriptpath, and interwikimap; handles response errors appropriately; no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malware detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the low malware score.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is thorough, and the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on user prompts during private wiki detection and URL parsing. No malicious activity identified.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent; no malware.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to user prompts but still low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring matches the described behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on fetching and parsing site info, no malicious activity. Standard operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard site detection, no malicious code, network requests straightforward.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores align with the behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Detects and analyzes MediaWiki sites, includes user prompts for private sites. No malicious activity, standard network and parsing routines.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — justified due to user prompts, but no significant risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varied (0.1–0.2), justified by normal user prompts and standard network handling.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to user prompts in private wikis, which are expected.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports' scores are appropriate given the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
