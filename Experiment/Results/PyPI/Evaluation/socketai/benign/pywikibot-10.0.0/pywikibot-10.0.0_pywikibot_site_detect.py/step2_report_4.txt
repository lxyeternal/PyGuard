  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described issues with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches and parses site info, HTML, and JSON responses. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are detected. The response validation and error handling appear standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk score is appropriate given the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard network operations, HTML/JSON parsing, and user prompts for private wikis. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) reflects the user input prompt, which is standard but could be considered a minor surface for misconfiguration. Still, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—fetching site info, parsing HTML, no malicious behavior, standard error handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard site detection with network requests, HTML parsing, and error handling. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The low risk score matches the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with the mention of user prompts for login on private wikis. No malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code performs network requests, parsing, and user prompts, but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, which is reasonable given the network interactions and user prompts but no malicious intent.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly higher due to user prompts and URL handling, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the code's content and behavior. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. It functions as a standard MediaWiki site detection utility.",
