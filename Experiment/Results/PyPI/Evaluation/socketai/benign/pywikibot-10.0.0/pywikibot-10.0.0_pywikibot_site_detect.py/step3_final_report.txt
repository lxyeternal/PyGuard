{
  "purpose": "The code fetches and parses MediaWiki site information, including version, server URLs, and API endpoints, to facilitate site detection and interaction.",
  "sources": "Network requests to fetch site info and HTML content, URL parsing, and user input prompts for private wikis.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network responses; user prompts could be misused if exploited, but are standard for authentication prompts.",
  "flows": "Fetch site info → parse HTML and JSON responses → handle private wiki prompts → set site attributes and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard network fetches, HTML parsing, and JSON handling with appropriate error checks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. User prompts are typical for private site detection. The response handling and version checks are straightforward. The overall structure is clear and aligns with expected behavior for a site detection utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
