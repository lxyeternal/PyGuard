  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code behavior with the provided source, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches site info, parses HTML, extracts version, URLs, and handles responses with proper error handling. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is observed.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs standard network and parsing operations, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Very low, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on user input during private wiki detection and URL parsing.\n- **Assessment:** The code's use of user prompts is normal for private site detection, not malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just standard user interaction.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on fetching and parsing site info, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code's operations are standard; no obfuscation or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem correct.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with standard fetch and parse routines.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Detects site info, handles private wikis with user prompts, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** User prompts are normal for authenticated access, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 fit.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — typical for network-dependent code that interacts with external sites, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final notes:** The scores given in all reports are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured MediaWiki site detection utility. It performs network requests, HTML and JSON parsing, and handles errors appropriately. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The security risk is minimal and accurately reflected in the scores.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. They accurately reflect the code's behavior and security posture.",
