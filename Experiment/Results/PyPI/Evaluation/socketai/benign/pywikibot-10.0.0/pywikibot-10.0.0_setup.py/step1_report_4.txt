  "anomalies": [
    "Use of exec() to run code from '__metadata__.py', which could be malicious if the file is tampered with.",
    "Potential reliance on external 'git' commands without validation or sanitization.",
    "Minimal input validation on contents read from files, although typical for setup scripts.",
    "Absence of any network activity or system-level modifications beyond standard package setup."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup functions: reading project metadata, validating versions, and configuring dependencies. The primary concern is the use of exec() to execute code from '__metadata__.py', which could be exploited if that file is maliciously altered. The subprocess call to 'git' for tags is standard, but relies on external command execution, which, if compromised, could lead to command injection; however, in this context, it is unlikely. No suspicious network activity or system modifications are present. Overall, the code aligns with common package setup practices but warrants caution regarding exec() usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a standard setup script with some potentially risky exec() calls to execute external code from project files. No malicious behavior or malware signatures are evident beyond the exec() usage, which could be a vector if the source files are compromised. The script does not exhibit typical malware indicators such as data exfiltration, network communication beyond package setup, or backdoors. Security risks are limited but should include verifying the integrity of included files.",
