  "purpose": "Setup script for Pywikibot framework, managing dependencies, version validation, and distribution tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata from '__metadata__.py', project name from 'pyproject.toml', and git tags for version validation.",
  "sinks": "Executes code from '__metadata__.py' via exec(), runs subprocess 'git' commands, calls sys.exit() for errors.",
  "flows": "Reads and executes metadata, compares versions with git tags, proceeds with setup if validation passes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on local metadata file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with common patterns such as reading metadata and dependencies. The use of exec() on '__metadata__.py' is a known pattern in setup scripts but poses a risk if the file is tampered with. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is clear and readable, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation techniques. The primary concern is the integrity of the metadata file, but this is a controlled pattern in packaging workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, legitimate setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of the '__metadata__.py' file to prevent execution of malicious code. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
