  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing version information and a loader component from within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing __version__ from ._version and loader from the current package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external data transmission, or dynamic code execution points present",
  "flows": "Static import flow from internal modules to package namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard package __init__.py pattern, importing version info and loader modules. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
