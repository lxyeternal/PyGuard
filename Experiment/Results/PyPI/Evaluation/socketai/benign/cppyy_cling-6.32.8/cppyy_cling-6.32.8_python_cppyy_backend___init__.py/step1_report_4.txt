{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and a module named 'loader' within the package, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._version import __version__ reads the version string; import of the 'loader' module loads internal package components.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is sent or processed in an insecure way.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports version info and a module, with no data flow or execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal import statement that pulls internal package version info and a local module. There are no code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, benign initialization snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign, serving to import internal package components without any malicious intent or security issues.",
