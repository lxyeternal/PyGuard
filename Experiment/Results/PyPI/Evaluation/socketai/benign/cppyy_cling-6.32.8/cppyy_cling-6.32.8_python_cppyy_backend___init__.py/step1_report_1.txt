  "purpose": "Importing version information and a loader module from the same package",
  "sources": "Import statements that load version data and a module within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static imports are used",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple relative imports of a version attribute and a loader module, which is standard practice in Python packages. No external data sources, untrusted input, or malicious code constructs are present. The imports are straightforward and typical for package initialization or internal module referencing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a Python package, solely responsible for importing internal components. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
