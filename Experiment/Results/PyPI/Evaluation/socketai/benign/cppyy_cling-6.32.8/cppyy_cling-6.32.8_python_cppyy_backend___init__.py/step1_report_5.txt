{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and a loader module, likely for package initialization or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing internal modules and version info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data processing points, as the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; it's just importing modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules. The first import fetches a version string, which is standard practice. The second import loads a module named 'loader'. There are no suspicious behaviors, no untrusted data inputs, and no dangerous operations observed. This appears to be standard package setup code, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of simple import statements for package version and loader module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
