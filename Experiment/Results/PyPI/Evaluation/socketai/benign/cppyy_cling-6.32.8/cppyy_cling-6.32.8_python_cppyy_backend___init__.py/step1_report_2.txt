{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and a loader module, likely for package initialization or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements for __version__ from a relative module and for loader module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward, typical for module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple import statements importing a version variable and a loader module from the same package. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. The minimal structure suggests this is part of a package's __init__.py or setup file, serving to expose version info and initialize components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python package initialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
