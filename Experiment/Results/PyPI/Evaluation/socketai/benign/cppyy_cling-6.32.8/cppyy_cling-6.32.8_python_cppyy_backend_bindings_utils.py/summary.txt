  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for setting up C++ bindings in Python projects. The main security consideration is the external script execution via load_source, which could be exploited if scripts are malicious. No active malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to external script trustworthiness. Proper validation of external scripts is recommended to mitigate potential risks."
