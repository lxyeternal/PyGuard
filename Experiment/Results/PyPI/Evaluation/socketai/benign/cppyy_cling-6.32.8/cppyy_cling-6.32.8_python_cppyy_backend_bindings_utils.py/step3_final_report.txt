  "flows": "From filesystem and external scripts to execution environment; load_source executes external scripts; subprocess checks pip version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of load_source to dynamically load external scripts ('extra_*.py'), which could execute arbitrary code if scripts are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a build utility for Python bindings to C++ code, involving dynamic module loading, reflection info parsing, and package setup. It uses load_source to load external scripts, which is a common plugin pattern but introduces a potential attack vector if scripts are untrusted. Subprocess calls are standard for environment detection. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate build and setup processes. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external scripts loaded dynamically, which could execute malicious code if compromised. The subprocess call for pip version detection is benign. The code does not perform network activity or system damage, and no obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for setting up C++ bindings in Python projects. The main security consideration is the external script execution via load_source, which could be exploited if scripts are malicious. No active malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to external script trustworthiness. Proper validation of external scripts is recommended to mitigate potential risks.",
