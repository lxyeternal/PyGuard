  "purpose": "Support utilities for binding initialization, setup, and package management in Python projects involving C++ bindings and CMake.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules (glob, json, os, sys, subprocess, re, inspect), third-party modules (setuptools, wheel, cppyy), and reading files (map files, extra Python scripts).",
  "sinks": "File operations (loading map and extra Python scripts), subprocess calls (pip version detection), and dynamic attribute setting on modules and entities.",
  "flows": "Loading reflection info and map files -> Importing custom scripts -> Calling functions within extra scripts -> Possibly executing subprocesses for pip detection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import/load_source for extra scripts, manipulation of modules and entities via setattr, and subprocess calls for pip version detection. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. No obfuscated code or hidden payloads are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides utility functions for setting up Python bindings with C++ using cppyy, including dynamic loading of modules, mapping operators, and configuring packaging. It loads reflection info, parses map files, and dynamically executes custom scripts. The subprocess call to check pip versions could be used maliciously if manipulated, but here it appears solely for environment setup. No code injection, network activity, or system damage behavior is evident. The code uses standard patterns for package setup and reflection, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for setting up C++ bindings in Python projects, with no malicious behavior or sabotage evident. It performs dynamic module loading, reflection setup, and package configuration without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
