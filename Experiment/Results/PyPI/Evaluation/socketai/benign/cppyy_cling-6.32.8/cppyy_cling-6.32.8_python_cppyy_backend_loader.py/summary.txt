  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and runtime setup utility for integrating C++ code into Python, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The low security risk score reflects the standard nature of environment and subprocess usage, which could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously manipulated, but this is a common risk in such scripts. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with its intended purpose."
