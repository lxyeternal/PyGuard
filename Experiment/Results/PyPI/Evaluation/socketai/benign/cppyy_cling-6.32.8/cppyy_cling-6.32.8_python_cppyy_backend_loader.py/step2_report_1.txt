  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code loads shared libraries, manages environment variables, and checks CUDA version. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern due to environment variable manipulation and subprocess calls, which are typical in build scripts.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The code performs standard library loading and build environment setup.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on library loading, precompiled headers, and compile options. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, considering environment manipulation and subprocess calls.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build and load utility, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focus on library loading, precompiled headers, compile options, with environment variables and subprocesses. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, due to environment and subprocess usage.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard build/setup code.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct reasoning; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, managing libraries, headers, and compile options, with environment variables and subprocess calls.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code is typical for build environment management.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focus on dynamic library loading, environment variables, subprocesses, and build optimizations. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build utility code.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting typical environmental and subprocess manipulations in build scripts. This is reasonable, given that environment variable manipulation can sometimes be exploited if external inputs are malicious, but no such exploitation is evident here.\n\n### Final Systematic Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear, not obfuscated).\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard build environment manipulations; minimal security concern).\n\n**Note:** No evidence suggests any malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code is a typical build and load utility for C++ integration in Python.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent in their assessments. The code is benign, with scores reflecting standard practices and minimal security risk. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
