  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard build configuration helper for ROOT/C++ environments. It performs environment detection and outputs configuration flags with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The minor security concern relates to trusting external scripts and environment variables, which is typical for such tools but should be used in trusted environments."
