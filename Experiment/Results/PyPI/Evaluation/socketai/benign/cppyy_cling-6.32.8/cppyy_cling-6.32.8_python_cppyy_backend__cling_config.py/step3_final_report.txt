  "purpose": "A configuration utility for ROOT/C++ projects that retrieves build flags and directories based on command-line options, environment variables, and external 'root-config' scripts.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variables ('STDCXX'), external script 'root-config', configuration files on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting configuration flags and directories, subprocess calls to 'root-config'.",
  "flows": "User provides command-line options -> script executes 'root-config' or reads config files -> outputs configuration data based on options and environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Reliance on external 'root-config' scripts and parsing of scripts on Windows could be manipulated if compromised, but this is standard for build configuration tools.",
  "analysis": "The code executes 'root-config' via subprocess, processes command-line options, and reads environment variables to generate build flags and directories. It includes fallback logic on Windows to parse scripts directly. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The subprocess calls and environment reads are typical for such utilities. The fallback parsing on Windows, while potentially risky if the scripts are tampered with, is a common pattern. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are justified given the benign nature and standard operations of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard build configuration helper for ROOT/C++ environments. It performs environment detection and outputs configuration flags with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The minor security concern relates to trusting external scripts and environment variables, which is typical for such tools but should be used in trusted environments.",
