{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for building, cleaning, and installing the 'cppyy-cling' package, which involves compiling C++ components and managing build artifacts.",
  "sources": "Reading README and version files, environment variables, subprocess calls for build commands, file I/O for configuration updates, and environment variables for build customization.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls for executing build and installation commands, file deletions and modifications for configuration files, environment variable modifications, and dynamic execution of commands.",
  "flows": "The script reads configuration files and environment variables (sources), then constructs and executes build and install commands via subprocess (sinks), which are based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to call external build tools (cmake, make), modifies system files and environment variables, deletes specific files during installation, and updates config files dynamically. No hardcoded credentials or obscure code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages the build and installation process for a C++ backend component via subprocess calls, environment variable manipulations, and file operations. It performs environment checks, creates build directories, runs CMake and make commands, updates configuration files based on environment variables and system info, and deletes specific files. All subprocess calls are standard build operations. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The file operations are straightforward updates to configuration files and cleanup. The code does not send data over networks, access sensitive data in an insecure manner, or contain suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building and installing a software package with complex build steps. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It performs system configuration, build orchestration, and cleanup in a typical manner for such scripts. No malicious signals, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
