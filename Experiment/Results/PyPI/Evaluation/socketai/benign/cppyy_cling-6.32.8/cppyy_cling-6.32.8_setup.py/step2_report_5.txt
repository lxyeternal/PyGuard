  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a complex build system orchestrating CMake, environment configs, and file modifications. It uses subprocess calls for building, installing, and configuring, but no malicious payloads or obfuscation are evident.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — moderate, due to extensive subprocess use and environment manipulations, which could be exploited if environment is compromised.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious activity or backdoors are present. The subprocess calls are standard for build scripts.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a build script managing environment variables, subprocess calls, and configuration file modifications. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, typical build operations.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** The report correctly notes the standard nature of subprocess calls and environment handling.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a detailed build and install script with environment-dependent configuration, file modifications, and subprocess execution. No malicious intent detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** The script manages build, clean, and install with subprocess calls, environment variables, and configuration modifications. No malicious signals.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** The report correctly identifies standard build operations without malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, orchestrating build and cleanup with subprocess, environment variables, and file modifications. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** Consistent with previous findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present in the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and standard for build scripts.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the inherent risks of subprocess calls and environment manipulations in build scripts but nothing indicating malicious intent.\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — typical build system risks, mitigated by the lack of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe script is a legitimate, complex build and installation setup for a C++/Python package. It uses subprocesses and environment variables as expected in such contexts. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The overall security posture appears sound, assuming the environment and external scripts are trustworthy.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain standard security practices—verify external scripts and environment control, but no immediate concerns are evident from this code.",
