  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a build system for cppyy-cling, involving subprocess calls, environment variables, and file modifications. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, and the overall risk is low (0.3).\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected. The subprocess calls are standard build commands.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.3 — modest, mainly due to extensive subprocess calls that could be exploited if environment is compromised, but no malicious intent evident.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code; no suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing build and install steps, environment variables, and file modifications. No signs of malicious activity, standard build process.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — very low, standard build script.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a build and install script with environment checks, file modifications, and subprocess calls. No malicious behavior observed.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is aligned; no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern: build orchestration, environment-dependent configuration, file modifications, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script manages build steps, environment variables, configuration files, and cleanup. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a complex build and installation script, involving subprocess calls, environment variables, and file modifications. No actual malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are evident.\n\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated segments.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the potential for misuse if environment or system is compromised, but no direct evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — standard build script, with some reliance on subprocess calls and environment variables, which could be exploited if system is compromised, but no signs of active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, albeit complex, build and installation script for a C++/Python package. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident from the code or reports. The low risk score reflects the potential for exploitation if the environment is compromised, but the script itself is standard for such build systems.",
