  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex build and installation script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is environmental security, not the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting the standard nature of build scripts and the potential for exploitation if the environment is compromised."
