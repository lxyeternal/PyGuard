  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code is only a version string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual in that only a version string is declared; no other code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable, which is typical for package versioning. No input, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious activity. The simplicity suggests no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
