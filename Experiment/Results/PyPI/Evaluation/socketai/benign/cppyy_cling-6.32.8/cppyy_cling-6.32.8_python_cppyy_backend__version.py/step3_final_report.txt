  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version declaration.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment of a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no external calls, data leaks, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the assignment is straightforward with no data movement or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, standard, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single assignment statement setting __version__ to a version string. There are no sources of untrusted input, no external interactions, and no control flow or logic. The code is a typical pattern used in Python packages for versioning. Given its simplicity and standard nature, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports accurately reflect its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
