  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a version string (`'6.32.8'`) to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, flows, or additional logic.\n   - This is a standard practice in Python packages for version declaration.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for package versioning.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is not obfuscated.\n   - **Security risk score**: All assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Any discrepancies or overestimations?**\n   - No. The scores align perfectly with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the simplicity and standard practice.\n\n5. **Additional considerations**:\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, there's no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n   - No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is purely based on the code snippet.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code is entirely benign with no security concerns.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code snippet.",
