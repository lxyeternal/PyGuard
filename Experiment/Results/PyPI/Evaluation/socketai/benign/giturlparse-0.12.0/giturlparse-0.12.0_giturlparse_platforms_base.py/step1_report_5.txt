{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for handling and parsing various Git URL formats using regex patterns, including domain and protocol handling.",
  "sources": "Initialization of regex patterns, class attributes, and the __init__ method which compiles regex patterns and sets up class variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; code mainly processes data internally and compiles regex patterns.",
  "flows": "Compilation of regex patterns -> Instantiation of class -> Data cleaning via static method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL manipulations, or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of class attributes and regex compilation appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines URL patterns and uses regex to parse Git repository URLs. The __init__ method precompiles regex patterns for efficiency. The class handles domain whitelisting/blacklisting via class attributes. The static method clean_data resets certain data fields and processes protocol list. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are present. Overall, the code seems to be a utility for URL parsing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling Git URL patterns and does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
