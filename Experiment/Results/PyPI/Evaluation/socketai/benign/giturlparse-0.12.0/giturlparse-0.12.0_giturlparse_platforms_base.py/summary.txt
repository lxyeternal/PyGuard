  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL parsing and data cleaning utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The minor security risk score of 0.2 in one report is unwarranted; it should be adjusted to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign purpose."
