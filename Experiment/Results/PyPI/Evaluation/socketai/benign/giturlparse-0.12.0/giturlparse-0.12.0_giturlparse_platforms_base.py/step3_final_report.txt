  "purpose": "Provides URL pattern matching and data normalization for Git repository URLs.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern definitions, pattern compilation, data['path'], data['branch'], data['protocols'], data['pathname']",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static regex patterns and data cleaning only",
  "flows": "Input data -> data['protocols'] split -> regex pattern matching -> data['path'], data['branch'], data['pathname'] cleaned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex compilation and data sanitization",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for Git URL schemes, compiles them with re.compile, and provides a static method to clean URL data fields. It performs no network activity, code injection, or credential handling. The patterns are standard for URL parsing. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is utility-based, focusing on URL normalization. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, aligning with the benign and structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL parsing and data cleaning utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The minor security risk score of 0.2 in one report is unwarranted; it should be adjusted to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign purpose.",
