  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a class defining URL pattern regexes, compiling them, and a static method to clean data.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling.\n- Patterns are standard for Git URL parsing.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior evident.\n- The purpose appears to be utility for URL parsing and normalization.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, purely structural, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms URL parsing purpose, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Again, URL parsing utility, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard URL pattern matching, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2). While the code is benign, assigning a small risk score might be a conservative default, but given the benign nature, 0.2 seems slightly high. It could be justified if considering potential future misuse, but as-is, it’s unnecessary.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Utility for Git URL parsing, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking Scores and Logic:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign URL parsing logic.\n- Malware scores are all zero, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- The only discrepancy is in Report 4, which assigns a small securityRisk of 0.2. Given the code's benign nature, this should be lowered to 0 or at most 0.1 if conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware scores:** All should remain at 0, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All should be 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Should be 0 for all, as the code is purely structural URL parsing with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0              | No malicious or obfuscated code. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Same reasoning. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0              | No issues. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Slightly overestimated; code is benign. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              | No malicious activity. |\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nYour initial scores are mostly appropriate. The only adjustment is lowering the securityRisk in Report 4 from 0.2 to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be 0 for all reports.**",
