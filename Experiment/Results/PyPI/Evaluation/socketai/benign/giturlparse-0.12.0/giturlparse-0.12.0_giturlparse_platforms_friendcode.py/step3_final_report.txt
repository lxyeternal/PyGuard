  "purpose": "Define URL patterns and formats for the 'friendco.de' domain to facilitate URL parsing within a larger framework.",
  "sources": "The regex pattern in PATTERNS for matching URLs, and the URL format string in FORMATS for constructing URLs from parsed components.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leakage, network calls, or code execution.",
  "flows": "The regex pattern captures URL components from input URLs; these components are used to generate formatted URLs, but no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard regex patterns and URL formatting. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for URL pattern matching specific to 'friendco.de', with regex patterns and URL formats. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. The regex is purpose-specific and standard for URL parsing. The reports uniformly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion that it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL pattern matching utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
