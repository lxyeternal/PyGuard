  "purpose": "Define URL patterns and formats for identifying and constructing Bitbucket repository URLs within a larger platform framework.",
  "sources": "URL patterns and format strings used for parsing or constructing repository URLs.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations are identifiable; primarily pattern definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex patterns for URL parsing appears standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or hidden code features. The DEFAULTS dictionary contains a generic username 'git', which is typical for such contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns and URL format strings for Bitbucket repository URLs, covering HTTPS and SSH protocols. No input handling, command execution, or external data processing is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are observed. The patterns appear straightforward for URL parsing purposes, and the DEFAULTS value is a common placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment serves as configuration for URL pattern matching and formatting within a larger system, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be a benign part of a URL handling module.",
