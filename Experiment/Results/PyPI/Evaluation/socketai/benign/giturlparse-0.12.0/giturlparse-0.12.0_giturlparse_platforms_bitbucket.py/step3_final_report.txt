  "purpose": "Defines regex patterns and URL templates for parsing and constructing Bitbucket repository URLs over HTTPS and SSH protocols.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for URL parsing, URL format templates, default user setting.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching and URL formatting based on input URL components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward URL handling logic with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module defining regex patterns and URL templates for Bitbucket URLs. It contains no dynamic data processing, network activity, or code execution. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The regex patterns are standard and correctly constructed for URL parsing. The default user 'git' is typical. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with its benign nature. The code's purpose is purely URL formatting and pattern matching, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL parsing utility for Bitbucket repositories with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
