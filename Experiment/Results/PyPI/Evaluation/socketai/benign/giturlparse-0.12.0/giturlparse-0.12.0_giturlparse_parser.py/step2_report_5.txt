  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the reported findings with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a URL parser that matches URLs against platform-specific regex patterns, extracts data, validates domains, and returns structured info.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- The code relies on external platform definitions, which are assumed safe.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard for URL parsing.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Parse URLs, extract platform info.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No issues detected in the code.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Parse URLs, extract info.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same as above; no malicious activity.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- External platform data could be a concern if malicious, but this is external and not part of the code.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Parse URLs, extract platform info.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious behavior or code issues.\n- Slightly lower security risk score, which is justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Parse URLs, extract data.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- The report's conclusion matches the code's behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- The risk score of 0 is appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Parse URLs, extract platform info.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- The reliance on external platform data is standard.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores seem appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is justified given the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2, considering external dependencies and potential regex issues, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code appears safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n**Final note:** Always verify external platform data sources for malicious patterns, but within this code scope, no issues are evident.",
