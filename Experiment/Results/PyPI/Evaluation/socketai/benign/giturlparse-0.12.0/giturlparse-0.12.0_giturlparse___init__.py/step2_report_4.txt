  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions, and assess the correctness of their scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward wrapper around imported parsing functions.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The functions process user input (`url`) but do not perform dangerous operations like network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- The core parsing logic resides in external modules (`_parse`, `GitUrlParsed`), which are assumed to be trusted or at least not malicious based on the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n- The code snippets match the description: simple wrappers for parsing and validation.\n- The flow of data is clear and consistent.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.1 (low, consistent with benign utility code)\n  - `confidence`: 0.9 (high confidence in benign assessment)\n\nThese scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious code, dynamic execution, or network activity.\n\n**Obfuscated code:**\n- Clearly not obfuscated; straightforward wrapper functions.\n- Scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0.1 across reports, indicating minimal concern.\n- Given that the functions accept untrusted input (`url`) and pass it to external modules, some minimal risk exists (e.g., if `_parse` or `GitUrlParsed` are malicious or vulnerable). However, the code itself does not perform unsafe operations.\n- The low risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential discrepancies or over/underestimations:\n- Since the core parsing logic is external, the security risk depends heavily on those modules. But given the reports' consensus and no evidence of malicious behavior, the assigned scores are justified.\n- The reports correctly do not overstate risk or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (low, consistent with benign URL parsing utility)\n\n**My own estimates align with the reports.** The code is a benign utility wrapper, with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with negligible security risk, and no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
