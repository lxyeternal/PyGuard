  "purpose": "This code is a minimal setup script for packaging a Python project, importing setuptools and calling setup() with default parameters.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import 'setuptools' and invoke 'setuptools.setup()' with no data or parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign Python packaging script with no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent.
