  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; standard setup invocation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script merely invokes setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Minimal code structure; very basic setup call.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls its setup() function with default parameters. It functions as a standard packaging script without any additional logic, input handling, or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden functionalities. The script appears to be a typical setup file used for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
