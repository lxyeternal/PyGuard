  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports the 'setuptools' library and invokes 'setuptools.setup()' with default parameters. There are no additional arguments, data inputs, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. The script adheres to standard packaging practices and does not contain any unusual or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
