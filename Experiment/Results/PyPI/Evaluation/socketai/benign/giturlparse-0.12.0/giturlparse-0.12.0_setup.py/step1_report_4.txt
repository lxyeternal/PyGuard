  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; setup call executes without data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and standard; no anomalies or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls the setup() function with default parameters. It performs a common package initialization routine without any additional logic, input handling, or data processing. There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variable usage, network activity, or obfuscation. The simplicity indicates a typical package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
