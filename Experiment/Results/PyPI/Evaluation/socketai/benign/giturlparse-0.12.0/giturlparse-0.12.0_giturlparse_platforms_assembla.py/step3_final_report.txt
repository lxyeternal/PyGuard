  "purpose": "Defines URL patterns, domains, formats, and defaults for handling Assembla Git repositories as static configuration.",
  "sources": "Class attributes: DOMAINS, PATTERNS, FORMATS, DEFAULTS",
  "sinks": "None; static data used for pattern matching",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted input processing",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class defining URL patterns and defaults for Assembla Git repositories. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. Regex patterns are simple and standard for URL parsing. No hardcoded secrets beyond a default username, which is benign. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The confidence in these assessments is high, given the straightforward structure and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its static nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
