  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (path, result, callback), and function calls within decorators and progress handler.",
  "sinks": "Return values of the decorated functions, callback's set_size and absolute_update methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> formatting functions -> decorated functions return processed data -> progress handler updates callback.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for formatting file info data structures, including deep copying, string manipulations, and decorators to ensure standard output format. The progress handler manages a callback for progress updates. No external data sources, network operations, or credential handling present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns without hidden or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for formatting and progress handling with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
