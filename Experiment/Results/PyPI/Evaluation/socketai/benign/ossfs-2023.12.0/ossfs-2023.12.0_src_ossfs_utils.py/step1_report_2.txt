  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting and prettifying file system info results, including decorators for standardizing output and progress handling.",
  "sources": "Input data from external functions (`ls`, `info`) and callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Return values of formatting functions, decorator wrappers, and the progress handler which interacts with callback objects.",
  "flows": "External data flows from `func` results into `_format_unify` and related functions, then back to callers; progress data flows from progress updates to callback objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious file manipulations, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of decorators and nested functions are standard patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and decorators to format and process data, specifically for file info results and progress handling. It uses standard Python features such as deep copy, inspect, and wrapping functions. No signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code operates on data structures typical for filesystem info, with no external network access or sensitive data handling. The progress handler interacts with callback objects in a typical manner. Overall, the code appears purely functional, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides standard utility functions for data formatting and progress reporting in filesystem operations. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. No malware or security threats identified.",
