  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling and formatting filesystem-like data structures, including prettifying output and progress handling.",
  "sources": "Function arguments such as 'result', 'path', 'callback', and function parameters, which are inputs from external callers.",
  "sinks": "Return values after formatting, callback invocation in 'as_progress_handler', and decorator wrapping functions, which could potentially be misused to interfere with control flow or data presentation.",
  "flows": "External inputs (result, path, callback) flow into formatting functions and decorators; formatted data or progress updates flow out; callback functions are invoked for progress reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of deepcopy is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected; progress handler encapsulates callback invocation cleanly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for data formatting and progress handling in a filesystem-like context. It uses standard Python constructs such as deepcopy, inspect, and decorators. The functions enhance readability and standardize output formats; no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The progress handler encapsulates a callback safely and manages progress updates without side effects. No suspicious or malicious logic detected. The code appears to be well-structured, straightforward, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions for data formatting and progress reporting. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The code is safe, with no malicious behavior or security threats identified.",
