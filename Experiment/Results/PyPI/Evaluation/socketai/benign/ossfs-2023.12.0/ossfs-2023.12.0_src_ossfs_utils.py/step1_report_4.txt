  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing and formatting filesystem information, including decorators for standardizing return formats and progress handling.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters such as path, result data from functions, and callback functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as data leaks, system commands, or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into formatting functions and decorators, with no untrusted data leading to external effects or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code primarily involves data processing and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for copying and formatting lists/dictionaries, decorators to unify function outputs, and a progress handler generator. It uses standard Python libraries like copy, inspect, and functools. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious behavior evident. The functions operate on provided data and callbacks without executing untrusted code or external commands. The decorators handle input parameters and results, maintaining standard formats. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward utility code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions for formatting filesystem info and handling progress callbacks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for data processing within a larger system.",
