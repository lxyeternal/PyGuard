{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for formatting and prettifying file system information results, including decorators for standardizing function outputs and a progress handler for tracking progress.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'path', 'result' from 'func' calls, and 'callback' for progress handling.",
  "sinks": "Return values after processing, especially via decorators, which could potentially be manipulated if the functions they decorate are untrusted or compromised.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters flows through formatting functions and decorators, then returns processed data; progress handler manages callback invocation during progress updates.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic. Use of dynamic features is limited to standard decorators and nested functions. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility and decorator functions for formatting output data and handling progress updates. It uses typical Python features such as deep copying, inspect for function signatures, and callback invocation. No network activity, file system access, or data exfiltration code is present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior detected. The functions operate on data passed as parameters, with no evidence of malicious manipulation. The code appears safe, focusing on formatting and callback management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for data formatting and progress handling. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no evidence of malware, and no security risks. It is safe and standard in its operations.",
