  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and the code's behavior.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of utility functions, decorators, and a progress handler.\n- No network activity, file system access, or data exfiltration is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The functions operate on data passed as parameters, with no evidence of malicious manipulation.\n- Use of standard Python features such as deepcopy, inspect, and decorators.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for formatting filesystem info and progress.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, safe, and standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malware detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 (appropriate)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions for formatting and progress.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still low; possibly considering the potential misuse of callback or data formatting, but nothing malicious is evident)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable. No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Formatting and progress functions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Formatting and decorators.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Formatting and progress.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (minimal, likely due to the general nature of utility functions)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the utility nature of the code, with minor elevation in some reports possibly due to the potential misuse of callbacks or data formatting.\n\n**Final justification:**\n- The code is purely utility functions for formatting and progress handling.\n- No network, file system, or secret handling.\n- No malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (completely benign utility code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores in the reports are appropriate and should not be adjusted.",
