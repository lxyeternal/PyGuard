  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for formatting and decorating filesystem info, with no suspicious logic or malicious payloads.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in safety.\n- **Notes:** The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard utility functions.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions for formatting and progress handling, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, perhaps due to the presence of callback functions, but no real security risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Notes:** The functions are typical, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions for formatting and progress handling, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — safe.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high confidence.\n- **Notes:** The functions are straightforward, standard, and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for formatting filesystem info, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Notes:** No malicious patterns, no external system calls, no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions for formatting and progress, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Notes:** The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the presence of callback functions, decorators, and data formatting, but no real security threat.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (average, considering the minimal potential for misuse of callbacks or decorators, but overall safe)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code analysis.",
