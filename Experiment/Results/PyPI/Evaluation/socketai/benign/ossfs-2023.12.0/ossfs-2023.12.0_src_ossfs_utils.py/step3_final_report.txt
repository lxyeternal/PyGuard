  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting filesystem info and handling progress callbacks, primarily for standard data presentation and progress updates.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing data (e.g., result lists, dictionaries), callback functions for progress updates.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks; data is processed internally and via callbacks only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting functions to return values; callback functions are invoked for progress updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions and decorators for formatting filesystem info and handling progress callbacks. It uses standard Python features such as deepcopy, inspect, and decorators. No external system calls, network activity, or secret handling are present. The functions operate on data passed as parameters, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The callback mechanism is standard and not inherently malicious. The code is well-structured, clear, and typical for utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
