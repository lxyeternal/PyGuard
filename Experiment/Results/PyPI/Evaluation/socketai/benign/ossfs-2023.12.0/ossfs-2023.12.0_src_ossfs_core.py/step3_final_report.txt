{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python filesystem interface to OSS (Object Storage Service), enabling listing, reading, writing, copying, and deleting objects within OSS buckets with error handling and caching.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as paths, bucket names, object keys, environment variables for configuration, and SDK method calls for OSS operations.",
  "sinks": "OSS SDK methods (e.g., get_object, put_object, delete_object), local file system operations (e.g., os.remove, os.makedirs), network calls for object transfer, and cache updates.",
  "flows": "User inputs → path parsing and validation → SDK method invocation (e.g., object_exists, get_object) → data transfer or metadata retrieval → optional cache update or file system operation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard SDK usage; no hidden network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cloud storage operations using the oss2 SDK, with proper error handling, retries, and cache management. It performs listing, existence checks, copying, deleting, and file transfer functions in a straightforward manner. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code manages paths and user inputs securely, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The malware score is justified as 0, and the low security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the standard, well-structured implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured OSS filesystem wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The current malware score of 0 and risk score of approximately 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
