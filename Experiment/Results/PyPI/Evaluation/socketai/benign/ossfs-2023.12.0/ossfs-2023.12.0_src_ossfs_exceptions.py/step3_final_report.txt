  "purpose": "Maps OSS error codes to Python exceptions for error handling.",
  "sources": "The error object passed to translate_oss_error, specifically error.__class__.__name__ and error.message.",
  "sinks": "The instantiated exception object returned by the function, potentially used elsewhere in exception handling.",
  "flows": "Error object -> class name extraction -> mapping to exception constructor -> exception instantiation -> return.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward exception translation without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard error mapping by checking if the error is an OssError, then translating based on class name. If unrecognized, wraps in IOError. No obfuscation, no malicious code, and no insecure operations are present. The use of class name as key is safe given known class naming conventions. The optional setting of __cause__ is correct. The logic is clear, safe, and typical for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for translating OSS errors into Python exceptions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is conservative; the actual risk is negligible. The malware score is correctly 0.0, and obfuscated score is 0.0.",
