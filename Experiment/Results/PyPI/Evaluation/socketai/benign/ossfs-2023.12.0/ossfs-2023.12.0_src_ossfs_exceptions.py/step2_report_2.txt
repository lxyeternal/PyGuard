  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Functionality and Logic Confirmation:**\n\n- The code maps specific OSS error codes to Python exceptions.\n- It checks if the error is an `OssError`. If not, it returns the original error.\n- For `OssError`, it retrieves the class name (`code`) and looks up the corresponding exception constructor.\n- If found, it creates the exception with the message; if not, wraps in an `IOError`.\n- It optionally sets the `__cause__` attribute.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code performs standard, safe exception translation without any malicious or suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n**2. Review of the Reports:**\n\nAll reports agree on the following points:\n\n- The purpose is to translate OSS errors into Python exceptions.\n- The sources are the error object and its message.\n- The sinks are the creation and return of exception instances.\n- The flow is straightforward: error -> code -> map -> instantiate -> return.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The logic is standard and safe.\n- The only minor variation is in the security risk score, which is very low (0.1) in some reports, possibly due to the wrapping of unknown errors in `IOError`.\n\n**3. Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0.0`, which is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- `obfuscated: 0.0` is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low (0.0 or 0.1), consistent with the absence of malicious or insecure behavior.\n\n**4. Validity of the Risk Scores:**\n\n- Since the code is a simple error translation utility, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The scores of 0.0 or 0.1 are reasonable, reflecting minimal or no security concern.\n\n**5. Potential Points of Concern:**\n\n- The only slight concern is that unrecognized errors are wrapped in `IOError`, which could obscure the original error type, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n- No evidence of backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly due to error wrapping, but no significant security issue.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a safe, standard utility for translating OSS errors into Python exceptions.\n- The reported scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is secure and well-understood.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, transparent implementation with negligible security concerns.",
