{
  "purpose": "The code translates OSS-specific errors into more natural Python exceptions, facilitating error handling.",
  "sources": "Error object 'error' of type OssError, error.message, class name of error for error code mapping.",
  "sinks": "Creation of new exception objects (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, IOError), assignment of __cause__ attribute.",
  "flows": "Error object -> determine error code -> map to Python exception -> create exception instance -> set __cause__ -> return exception.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code handles exceptions and error translation straightforwardly without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping from OSS error codes to Python exceptions, then translates an OssError into the appropriate exception instance, including optional cause setting. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. It uses standard exception handling and object attributes. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security flaws are observed. The code performs expected error translation, with proper checks and fallback to IOError for unknown errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error translation utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly maps OSS errors to Python exceptions and handles error propagation safely.",
