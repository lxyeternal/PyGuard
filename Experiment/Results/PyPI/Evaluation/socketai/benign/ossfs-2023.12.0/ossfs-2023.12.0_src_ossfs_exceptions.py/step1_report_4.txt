  "purpose": "Convert OSS-specific errors into more natural Python exceptions for easier handling.",
  "sources": "Error messages from OssError objects, specifically error.__class__.__name__ and error.message.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation and raising, particularly in the constructor calls for FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and IOError.",
  "flows": "Error object -> Determine class name -> Map to Python exception -> Instantiate exception -> Return or raise.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of error.__class__.__name__ as a key is straightforward and safe. The code handles unrecognized errors gracefully by wrapping them in IOError. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code safely maps known OSS error codes to corresponding Python exceptions using a predefined dictionary. It includes a function to translate OSS errors into Python exceptions, with optional message customization and cause setting. The function handles unrecognized errors by wrapping them in IOError. No external data leakage, unsafe code execution, or malicious behavior detected. The approach is standard and does not involve dynamic code execution or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs error translation from OSS errors to Python exceptions in a secure and straightforward manner. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The implementation is clear and follows best practices for exception handling.",
