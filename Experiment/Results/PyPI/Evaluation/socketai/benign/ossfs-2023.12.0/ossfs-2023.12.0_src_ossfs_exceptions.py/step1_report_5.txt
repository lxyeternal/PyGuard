{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility function to translate OSS-specific exceptions into more natural or Pythonic exceptions, facilitating error handling in applications interacting with OSS.",
  "sources": "The function reads from the 'error' parameter, specifically the 'error.message' attribute and the class name of 'error'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns instantiated exceptions based on the input error; these exceptions are thrown elsewhere in the application.",
  "flows": "The source 'error' flows into 'translate_oss_error', which then determines the appropriate exception type and returns it, potentially setting '__cause__'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code uses a static mapping for error code translation and standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static mapping from OSS error codes to Python exceptions, then provides a function that converts an OssError into an appropriate Python exception, wrapping unrecognized errors as IOError. It handles setting the exception cause and supports custom messages. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious code flows, network activity, or data leaks. It simply maps exceptions for error handling, which is standard practice. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard error translation utility for handling OSS exceptions. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs safe exception handling and conversion.",
