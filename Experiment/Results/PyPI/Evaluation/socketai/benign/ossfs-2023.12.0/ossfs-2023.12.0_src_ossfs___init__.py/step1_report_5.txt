{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python interface for OSS (Object Storage Service) file systems, including synchronous and asynchronous implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_oss, .core, and .file; no external data input or user input is explicitly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output functions, no untrusted data handling, or network communication are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted data sources and sinks; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code present. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization snippet that imports classes related to OSS file system operations. It defines what symbols are publicly available. There is no suspicious activity such as data leaks, code injection, or malicious logic. The absence of any user input handling, network activity, or secret management suggests no malicious intent. No complex logic or dynamic code execution is present that could hide malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a standard package interface definition with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
