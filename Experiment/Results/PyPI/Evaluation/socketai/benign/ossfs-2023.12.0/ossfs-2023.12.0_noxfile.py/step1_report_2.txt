  "purpose": "Automate project tasks such as testing, linting, security scanning, building, and setting up development environment using nox.",
  "sources": "Input data from session.posargs, environment variables, and file system (glob).",
  "sinks": "Execution of external commands (session.run), installations, and environment modifications.",
  "flows": "Input from session.posargs and environment variables flows into command executions and environment setup processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors; standard development automation scripts. No unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script automates typical development workflows such as testing, linting, security checking, building, and environment setup. Uses nox sessions to execute commands like 'pytest', 'pre-commit', 'mypy', 'pylint', 'safety', 'build', and 'twine'. All command executions appear standard for project maintenance. No dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration observed. Environment variables and input parameters are used safely. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical automation script for development workflows with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs legitimate tasks using common tools without any suspicious activity.",
