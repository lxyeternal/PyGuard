  "purpose": "Generate documentation reference pages for Python source files in the 'src' directory.",
  "sources": "Reading all Python files (*.py) in the 'src' directory and its subdirectories.",
  "sinks": "Writing markdown files (*.md) into the 'reference' directory, and setting edit paths for documentation.",
  "flows": "Source: 'Path' object reading files from 'src'; Sink: writing to 'reference' directory; Flow: source files processed to generate documentation pages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard use of Path and file operations; no obfuscated or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script searches for Python files in a specified directory, constructs corresponding documentation paths, and writes reference files with a standardized format. It skips '__main__' files and processes '__init__' files differently by renaming the output to 'index.md'. The code relies on well-known libraries and performs standard filesystem operations for documentation generation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or system harm. All operations appear to be part of a legitimate documentation build process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical documentation generator script using 'mkdocs' tools; it performs no malicious actions or security risks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
