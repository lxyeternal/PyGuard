{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for various data structures and transformation configurations used in data processing and machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn) and local type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no code executes untrusted data or performs output operations.",
  "flows": "Type alias definitions are static; no runtime data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common libraries used for data science tasks, then defines multiple type aliases to clarify data structures and parameters for machine learning pipelines. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data manipulation. The purpose appears to be improving code readability and maintainability through type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotation and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It helps in static type checking for data science workflows. Overall, it is safe.",
