{
  "purpose": "Define convenient type aliases for various data structures, transformers, and functions used in machine learning pipelines, primarily to enhance code readability and type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as numpy, pandas, scipy, and scikit-learn, and defines type aliases based on these modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious behavior. The code is purely defining types and aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources; the code only contains type annotations and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present. The code strictly focuses on type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several scientific computing and machine learning libraries, then defines a set of type aliases for various data formats, transformers, and parameters used in ML pipelines. These type aliases facilitate clearer code and better type checking. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a machine learning project, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions intended to improve code clarity and type safety within a machine learning project. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
