{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various data structures, transformers, and functions used in data processing and machine learning pipelines.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (typing, numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn) which provide data processing and ML functionalities.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code only defines type aliases and imports, with no data handling or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and only contains type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common libraries used in data science workflows and defines various type aliases to improve code readability and enforce type hints. These are standard practice for large ML codebases and do not involve any data manipulation, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, nor any hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional, serving as type aliasing for a data science project. It poses no security risk, malware threat, or malicious intent based on its content.",
