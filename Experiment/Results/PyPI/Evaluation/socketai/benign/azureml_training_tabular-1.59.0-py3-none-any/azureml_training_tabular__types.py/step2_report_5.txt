  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as simple type alias definitions for data structures and ML pipeline components.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or I/O operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The code relies solely on standard libraries and straightforward type annotations.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, and all reports agree that the code is benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is static, purely declarative, and intended to improve code clarity and type safety.\n- No external or untrusted data handling, no code execution, and no network activity.\n- The purpose is to facilitate better static analysis and readability in ML workflows.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is also correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- None detected. All assessments are aligned and reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and purely for type annotations.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The risk score should remain at 0, and malware at 0, as there are no malicious elements.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard set of type alias definitions for a machine learning project. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the current scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
