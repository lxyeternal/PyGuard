{
  "purpose": "Define convenient type aliases for various data and transformer structures used in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn). No external or user input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs; the code is purely type annotation definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for clarity in a machine learning context, importing standard libraries and defining types like data inputs, transformers, and parameters. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data interaction is present. All elements are static type annotations aimed at improving code readability and type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for a machine learning project. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks. It appears to be safe and solely intended for type clarity.",
