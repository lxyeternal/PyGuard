  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is solely defining type aliases for ML workflows.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, input/output, or external data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The purpose is to improve code clarity and type safety.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issue presence:** The code is just type alias definitions; no issues in the code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; risk score 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward, purely declarative.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; only type aliases.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is purely declarative with no security implications.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks involved.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard set of type alias definitions for ML workflows, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
