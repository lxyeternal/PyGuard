  "purpose": "Type alias definitions for ML data structures, transformers, and parameters to improve code clarity and type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports of numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, and type alias declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static type alias definitions with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is purely declarative with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions and imports, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions. It is static, straightforward, and intended for static type safety in ML workflows. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to improve code clarity and maintainability, not to perform any runtime actions or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative, and safe. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
