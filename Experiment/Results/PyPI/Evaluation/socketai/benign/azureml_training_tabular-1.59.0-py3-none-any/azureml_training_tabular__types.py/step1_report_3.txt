{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and type hints for data handling, transformation, and feature engineering in a machine learning context.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, and the module's own type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains untrusted data sinks or any operations that process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code solely defines type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. All code consists of standard import statements and type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type alias definitions to facilitate clearer code in a machine learning pipeline. It imports standard libraries and defines various union types for data inputs, transformers, and parameters. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears purely declarative, setting up type hints for other parts of a project. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions and import statements intended for a machine learning data pipeline. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
