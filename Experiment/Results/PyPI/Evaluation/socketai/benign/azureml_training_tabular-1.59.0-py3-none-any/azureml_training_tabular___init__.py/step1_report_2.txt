{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up package metadata and extend package search paths for a Python module related to automated machine learning.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports (__import__), package version data (__version__, VERSION, SELFVERSION), and the package path (__path__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; no data is sent over network, written to files, or used in dangerous system calls.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, setting version variables, and extending the package path, without any untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The __import__ call is standard for dynamic module extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module to extend the package path, which is a standard practice for namespace packages. It attempts to import version information from a local _version module, with fallback defaults if the import fails. There are no suspicious functions, network calls, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical package setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk in this code snippet. It is standard package setup code with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
