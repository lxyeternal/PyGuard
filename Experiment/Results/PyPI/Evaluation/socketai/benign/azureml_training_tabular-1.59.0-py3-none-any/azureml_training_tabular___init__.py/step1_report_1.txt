  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and manages versioning for a Python package related to automated machine learning.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version information from internal modules (_version).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Importing version info from internal modules, assigning to package variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to handle ImportError for version info, but no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious functions present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package versioning, importing version information from internal modules. It uses standard Python practices for optional imports and version fallback. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, and no code execution based on untrusted input. The use of 'pkgutil.extend_path' is typical for namespace packages. No suspicious or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package management code for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
