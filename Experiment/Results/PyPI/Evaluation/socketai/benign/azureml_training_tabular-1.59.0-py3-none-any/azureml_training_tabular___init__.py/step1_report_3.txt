  "purpose": "Define package version information and extend package path for a machine learning package.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from internal _version module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs; no external data or system modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "Package metadata import flows, no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__) for path extension is typical for namespace packages; no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up package versioning and namespace extension, with fallback to default version if import fails. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulation, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The import of __path__ extension is standard for namespace packages. The try-except block manages import errors gracefully, setting version to '0.0.0+dev'. There are no obfuscated elements, hidden behaviors, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup for a Python package, primarily handling version info and namespace extension without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
