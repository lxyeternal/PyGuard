  "purpose": "Manage package versioning and namespace extension in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Importing from ._version module, extending __path__ via pkgutil",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network calls, or external sinks present",
  "flows": "Import version info -> assign __version__ -> extend __path__",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initialization snippet. It imports version info from an internal module with a fallback to default version strings, and extends the package namespace using pkgutil.extend_path. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or malicious behaviors. The try-except block handles missing modules gracefully, which is common practice. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a routine, safe package setup snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign nature and poses no security concerns.",
