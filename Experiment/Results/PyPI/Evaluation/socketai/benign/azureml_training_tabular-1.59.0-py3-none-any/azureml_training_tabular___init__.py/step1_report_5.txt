  "purpose": "Define package versioning and extend the package path for a machine learning module",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'pkgutil' and local version variables from _version module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "Importing version info from _version module (if available) to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package versioning and path extension, with standard try-except handling for import errors. It imports 'pkgutil' to extend the package path and conditionally imports version information from a local module '_version'. The fallback sets default version strings when '_version' is unavailable. No data is transmitted, no untrusted input is processed, and no malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package setup snippet for version management, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
