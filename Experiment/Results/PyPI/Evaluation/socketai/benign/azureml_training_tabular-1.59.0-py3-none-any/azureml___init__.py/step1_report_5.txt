{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package data inclusion.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' on '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> call to 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' -> no further data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__path__' and '__name__' suggests standard package structure; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the '__path__' attribute of a package to include additional locations, a common practice for namespace packages or package extensions. It uses standard Python functions and variables. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, or backdoors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate and standard package namespace extension, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
