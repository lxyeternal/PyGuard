  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; internal modification only",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend '__path__' in current namespace",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward standard pattern",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and modifies '__path__' to support namespace packages, a common and benign pattern in Python packaging. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation detected. The code is minimal and standard, with no external communication or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe pattern for namespace package extension with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and scores are appropriate.",
