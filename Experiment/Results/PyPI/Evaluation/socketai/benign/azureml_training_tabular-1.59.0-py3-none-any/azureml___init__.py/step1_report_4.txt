{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package compatibility or plugin loading",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path() with __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only manipulates internal package path",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; use of __import__ and extend_path() is standard for namespace packages",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends __path__ for namespace package support. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard pattern for namespace package support in Python. There are no unusual constructs or obfuscation. No data is being read from untrusted sources, and no sinks are invoked that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package pattern without malicious intent or security risks.",
