  "purpose": "Extend the package's search path for module resolution.",
  "sources": "The line '__path__ = __import__(\"pkgutil\").extend_path(__path__, __name__)' reads the __path__ variable and dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only manipulates the __path__ variable.",
  "flows": "The source (reading __path__ and importing 'pkgutil') flows into the extend_path method, which modifies __path__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extend_path to modify __path__ is common in namespace packages; no anomalies or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends the module's __path__, likely to support namespace package resolution. This is a standard pattern in Python for managing package paths. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, is evident. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace package extension without malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and normal in context.",
