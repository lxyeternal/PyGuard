  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__import__' to extend '__path__'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system or data leaks",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend '__path__' with the current module name",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' with dynamic extension of '__path__' is somewhat uncommon but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically and extends the '__path__' variable, likely to support namespace packages. This is a standard technique in Python packaging. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected. The code's structure is minimal and does not perform any network activity, data access, or other potentially malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, minimal package setup snippet to support namespace packages. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
