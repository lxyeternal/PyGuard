{
  "purpose": "Compute and generate binning information for dataset targets, primarily for visualization and analysis in AutoML workflows.",
  "sources": "Input data: y (target values), n_valid (number of validation points), X (features), cv_splits object providing split configurations, and internal percentile calculations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that lead to data leaks or external communication; the code primarily processes data internally. No network or system command calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (y, n_valid, cv_splits) -> binning calculations in make_dataset_bins -> output dict with bin edges and counts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Use of external libraries like numpy and internal modules appears standard. No backdoors or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully computes data bins for target variables, including handling skewed data via percentile calculations. It contains assertions to validate input sizes and data properties. Functions like _fix_skewed_outliers and _round_bin_edge ensure bins are meaningful and UI-friendly. No suspicious network operations, file access, or external system commands are found. All operations are focused on data processing and visualization preparation. Exception handling ensures robustness but does not introduce malicious behavior. The code adheres to standard data binning procedures without evident malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data binning logic for visualization purposes within AutoML workflows. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. It is a legitimate utility module with no security concerns.",
