{
  "purpose": "The code computes binning information for dataset targets, used for histogram visualization and statistical summaries within an AutoML framework, supporting cross-validation and other split types.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'y' (target values), 'n_valid' (validation set size), and data splits from cv_splits, such as indices and split types.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and returns bin edges, counts, and related info; no data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into bin calculation functions, with percentile computations and bin edge rounding; no untrusted external sources or outputs interacting with external systems are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are observed. The code appears to perform standard statistical binning calculations with exception handling and assertions for input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses numpy and mathematical operations to compute dataset binning based on percentiles, with safeguards for skewed data and edge rounding for visualization. It validates input sizes and shapes, handles various cross-validation schemes, and constructs dictionaries with bin information. No external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. It employs standard libraries and internal utility functions for logging and assertions. There are no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. Exception handling and assertions indicate robustness against invalid inputs but do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dataset binning utility used for AutoML target visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates purely within data processing, with appropriate validation and error handling.",
