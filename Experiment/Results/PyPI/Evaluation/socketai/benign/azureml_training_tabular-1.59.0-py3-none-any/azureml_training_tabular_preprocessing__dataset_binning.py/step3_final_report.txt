{
  "purpose": "Compute histogram bins for target data in AutoML workflows, handling outliers, skewness, and rounding for visualization.",
  "sources": "Input target array y, validation set size n_valid, percentile parameter, and data from cross-validation splits.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with bin counts and edges; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data y and validation info flow into percentile calculations, skew handling, and bin edge rounding functions, producing bin info dict.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Exception handling and assertions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs percentile-based binning, handles skewed data with iterative percentile adjustments, and rounds bin edges for UI display. It validates inputs, manages exceptions, and supports multiple CV schemes. No external communication or obfuscation is present. The functions are standard for data binning and visualization support, with appropriate validation and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for dataset binning in AutoML, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.",
