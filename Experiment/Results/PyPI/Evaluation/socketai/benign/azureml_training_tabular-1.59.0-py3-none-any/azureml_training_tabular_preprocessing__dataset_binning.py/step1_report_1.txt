{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to compute data bins for dataset targets, primarily for histogram visualization and analysis in AutoML processes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters such as 'y', 'X', and CV split indices; also reads configuration and parameters related to validation splits.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs bin edges and bin counts; no explicit sinks in terms of data leakage or malicious actions, but could be used to infer dataset characteristics if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables ('y', 'X', 'split_indices') through functions to generate bin edges and counts, returning a dictionary of bin info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious control flow patterns; the code appears standard for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dataset binning based on percentiles and dataset size, handling skewed data with specific adjustments. It includes validation assertions, percentile calculations, and edge rounding for visualization. No dynamic code execution, external network access, or obfuscated code is present. The functions are straightforward, focusing solely on binning logic. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified, and the code adheres to common data processing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for dataset binning in AutoML workflows. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is well-structured, with validation and error handling, and appears safe for use.",
