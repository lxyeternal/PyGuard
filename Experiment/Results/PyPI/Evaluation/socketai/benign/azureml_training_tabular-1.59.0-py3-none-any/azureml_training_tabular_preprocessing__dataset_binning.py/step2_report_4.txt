  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs dataset binning for visualization and analysis in AutoML workflows.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, external data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are mentioned.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (numpy, math) and internal validation/assertion utilities.\n- The functions are focused on percentile-based binning, handling skewed data, and rounding edges for UI presentation.\n- Exception handling and input validation are present, indicating robustness.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes, the code performs dataset binning as described. No issues or anomalies are evident.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are identified. The approach to binning, skew handling, and edge rounding appears sound and standard.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9–1.0) across reports; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware:** 0, no malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (~0.1), as the code is purely data processing with no external communication or side effects.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only minor concern might be that the binning information could be used to infer dataset characteristics, but this is standard for visualization purposes and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard data processing risk)  \n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a legitimate utility for dataset binning, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It uses standard libraries, performs validation, and handles exceptions properly. Its purpose is to facilitate visualization and statistical summaries, which inherently involves analyzing dataset properties. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's functionality. The overall security posture is very safe, with no indications of malicious activity.",
