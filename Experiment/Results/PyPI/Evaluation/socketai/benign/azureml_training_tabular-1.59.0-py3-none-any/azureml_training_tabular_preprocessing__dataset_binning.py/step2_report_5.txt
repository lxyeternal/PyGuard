  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code performs dataset binning for visualization and analysis, primarily based on percentile calculations.\n- It handles skewed data, outliers, and rounding for UI presentation.\n- It uses standard libraries (numpy, math) and internal validation/assertion mechanisms.\n- No external network activity, file access, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow are detected.\n- Exception handling and assertions suggest robustness but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; standard binning utility.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate utility for dataset binning, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, justified by the benign nature).\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; standard binning, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard data binning; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as previous; standard, safe data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1 (given). The report states 0.0, but the overall pattern suggests a very low risk.\n\n**Note:** The reported risk score is 0, which is acceptable, given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard for dataset binning, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low risk (0 or 0.1). Given the code's purpose and behavior, this is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Comments & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code appears entirely legitimate, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The low risk scores are justified, considering the code's data processing nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary for the scores.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\nThis reflects the benign, standard nature of the code, which performs statistical binning for visualization purposes without any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
