{
  "purpose": "The code computes data bins for visualization and analysis of target variables in AutoML workflows, specifically for regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data y (target values), validation set size n_valid, and cross-validation split information from cv_splits.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from y to compute percentiles and bin edges; no data is transmitted externally or to network; no sinks appear to leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input y is used to compute percentiles and bin edges within make_dataset_bins and associated functions, with no external data transmission or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code primarily performs statistical binning calculations; no suspicious code flows or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical binning for target variable y, with functions to handle skewed data and rounding of bin edges for UI display. It includes input validation and exception handling, and uses percentile calculations for outlier bins. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling outside of numerical processing is found. The functions serve standard data binning purposes with no malicious intent. Use of external libraries like numpy and logging is appropriate and standard for data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of dataset binning for visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs statistical calculations responsibly and securely, with no external communication or harmful logic.",
