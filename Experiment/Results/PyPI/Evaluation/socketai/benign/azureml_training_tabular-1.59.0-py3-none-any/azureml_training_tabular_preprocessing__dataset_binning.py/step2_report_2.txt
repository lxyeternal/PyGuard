  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of issues, logical flaws, scoring appropriateness, and potential malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a dataset binning utility used in AutoML workflows, primarily for visualization and statistical summaries.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (numpy, math) and internal validation/assertion mechanisms.\n- No external network activity, file I/O, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The functions perform percentile-based binning, handle skewed data, and round bin edges for UI presentation.\n- Exception handling and assertions are used for robustness, not malicious intent.\n- The reported scores are consistently low for malware and obfuscation, and security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The logic appears sound; no issues with the implementation of percentile calculations, bin edge rounding, or handling skewed data.\n- **Potential issues:** No indications of data leakage, malicious data handling, or backdoors.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No evident logical errors or flaws. The code is standard for binning tasks.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the utility nature and lack of security concerns.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- The code performs legitimate data processing for visualization.\n- No malicious payloads, external communications, or obfuscation.\n- The low security risk score (around 0.1) reflects minimal concern, mainly due to the code's data handling nature.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9 to 1.0) are justified given the straightforward, transparent code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal security risk, mainly due to the data processing context.\n\n**Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk scores are aligned with the reports' assessments.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured dataset binning utility.\n- No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The scoring in the reports is appropriate and justified.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this review.\n\n**Final verdict:** The code is safe, legitimate, and does not pose security risks.",
