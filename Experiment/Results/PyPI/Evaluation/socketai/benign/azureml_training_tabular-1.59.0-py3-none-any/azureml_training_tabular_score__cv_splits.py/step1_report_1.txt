{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for creating and managing cross-validation splits in machine learning workflows, including support for time series data and custom splits.",
  "sources": "Input data (X, y, sample_weight), configuration parameters for CV splits, random seed, time series schema, custom split indices, and test cutoff indices.",
  "sinks": "Data splits are generated and stored internally; no direct data leakage or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. No untrusted data is used to perform external network actions or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input parameters (sources), processed to create various CV splits depending on configuration, stored in class attributes, and used to generate train/test/validation datasets. No external network or system calls are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of standard libraries and common ML practices. No apparent malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically creates cross-validation splits based on input parameters and data types. It handles multiple CV scenarios, including time series and custom splits, with validation checks for input correctness. No operations suggest malicious intent; functions are focused on split logic, data management, and validation. The code does not perform network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. All logic aligns with standard CV processes in ML pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of cross-validation split management for machine learning, including time series support. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. No indicators of malware or security risks are found. The code is well-structured, with validation and error handling, indicating a focus on correct CV split creation.",
