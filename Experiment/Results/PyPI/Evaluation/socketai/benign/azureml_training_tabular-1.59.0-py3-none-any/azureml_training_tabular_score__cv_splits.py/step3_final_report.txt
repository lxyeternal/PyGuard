  "purpose": "Manage and validate cross-validation splits for machine learning workflows, including time series support, custom splits, stratification, and validation checks.",
  "sources": "Data input (X, y), optional split indices, configuration parameters for CV type, time series schema, and validation thresholds.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is permuted or split based on CV type; validation functions ensure correctness; splits are stored and retrieved for training/validation/testing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is well-structured and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements comprehensive cross-validation split management with extensive validation, including handling of time series data, custom splits, stratification, and validation of parameters. No malicious activity, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Validation ensures proper split sizes and disjointness. The code is designed for robustness and correctness, with no signs of sabotage or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for ML data splitting and validation. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
