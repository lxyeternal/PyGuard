  "sources": "The line importing 'pkgutil' and calling 'extend_path' to modify __path__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call 'extend_path' with __path__ and __name__",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard pattern for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses its 'extend_path' function to modify the '__path__' variable, which is typical for supporting namespace packages. It is a common pattern in Python packaging, especially for Microsoft or other large projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no external data sources or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard namespace package extension pattern without any malicious intent or security risks.",
