{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package distribution or modularization",
  "sources": "Import statement: __import__('pkgutil')",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to external systems or sensitive areas",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code simply modifies __path__",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with string argument is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends the __path__ variable, which is a common technique for namespace packages or complex package structures. No external data input, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors or malicious code detected. The pattern is consistent with standard package setup for modular Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard, benign code used for package path extension. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
