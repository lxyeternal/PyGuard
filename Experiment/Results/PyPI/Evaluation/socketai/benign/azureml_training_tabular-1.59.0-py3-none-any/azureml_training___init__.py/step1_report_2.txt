  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package compatibility",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify __path__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data interactions are present",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil', calls 'extend_path' with __path__ and __name__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward namespace package pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ using 'extend_path', which is a standard pattern for namespace packages in Python. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and aligns with typical namespace package initialization practices. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension with no malicious intent or security risks.",
