  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ variable for namespace package support using pkgutil's extend_path function.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module and call to extend_path() on __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' -> call to extend_path() to modify __path__ for namespace support.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a standard, straightforward pattern with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and uses extend_path() to support namespace packages, a common pattern in Python packaging. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The code is minimal, clear, and aligns with standard practices. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension pattern with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
