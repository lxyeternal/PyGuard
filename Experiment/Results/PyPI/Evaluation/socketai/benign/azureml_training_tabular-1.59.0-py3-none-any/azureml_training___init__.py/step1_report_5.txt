{
  "purpose": "To extend the module's search path for package resources, typically used in namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The source is 'pkgutil.extend_path', which modifies '__path__', but there is no untrusted input influencing the behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for namespace packages, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern used in Python namespace packages to extend the search path for modules. It imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify '__path__'. This is a common practice and does not involve any data input, secrets, or malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign snippet used for namespace package support. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
