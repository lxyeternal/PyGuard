  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the provided code snippets are solely comment headers containing copyright notices. There are no executable statements, data processing, or input/output operations. Therefore, there are no issues related to code logic, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior in these snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of code, data flows, or suspicious patterns. No flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- *Confidence:* All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code snippets.  \n- *Obfuscated:* All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- *Malware:* All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n- *Security Risk:* All are 0, consistent with the comments-only nature of the snippets.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**  \nSince all snippets are just comments with no executable or suspicious content, there is no justification for increasing the risk or malware scores. The assessments are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the observable code.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk in comment headers.\n\n**Overall, the code snippets are benign.**  \nGiven the uniformity and clarity, I agree with the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my own estimates:\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior or code present.                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear comments with no obfuscation techniques.               |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No executable code, data flow, or vulnerabilities.          |\n\n**Final note:** These snippets are purely comments, serving as legal or attribution notices, and pose no security concern.",
