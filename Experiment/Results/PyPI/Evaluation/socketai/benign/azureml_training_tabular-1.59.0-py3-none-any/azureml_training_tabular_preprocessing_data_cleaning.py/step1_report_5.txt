{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for data cleaning, specifically removing rows with NaN or invalid labels in a dataset used for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Data input arrays X, y, and optional sample_weight, which are read and processed within functions.",
  "sinks": "Processed data outputs (X_new, y_new, sample_weight_new) after removal of invalid rows; no untrusted data is written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are read, evaluated for NaN or invalid entries, and then filtered or deleted; resulting data is output after cleaning.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No code appears to perform any malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system damage. Logging is limited to info/error messages about data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for identifying missing or invalid labels in datasets, removing NaN or empty entries, and handling sparse and pandas data structures. It uses standard numpy, pandas, and scipy functions for data filtering. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports are present. Import statements are consistent with data processing tasks. The functions are designed for cleaning data before model training, with appropriate error handling for cases where all data is invalid. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious side-effects, or malicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data cleaning module used in machine learning workflows. It performs expected operations without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or harmful activities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
