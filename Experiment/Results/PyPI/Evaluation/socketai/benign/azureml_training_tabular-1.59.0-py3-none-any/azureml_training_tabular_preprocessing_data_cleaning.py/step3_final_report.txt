  "purpose": "Functions designed to identify and remove NaN or invalid labels from datasets, ensuring data quality for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input datasets such as numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, and sparse matrices; configuration objects for data processing.",
  "sinks": "Returns cleaned datasets with invalid entries removed, potentially raising exceptions if all data is invalid.",
  "flows": "Detects missing or invalid labels in y, then removes corresponding rows from X and sample_weight, handling sparse/dense data appropriately.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; straightforward data cleaning logic with no obfuscation or external system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard methods (np.isnan, pd.isna, np.isin) to identify invalid labels, then removes these entries from datasets. It handles various data formats correctly, raises exceptions if all data is invalid, and uses configuration logic to determine whether to perform NaN removal. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical data preprocessing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data cleaning utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It effectively handles missing data scenarios without introducing vulnerabilities or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
