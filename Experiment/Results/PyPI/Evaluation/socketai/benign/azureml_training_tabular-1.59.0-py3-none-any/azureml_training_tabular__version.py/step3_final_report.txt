  "purpose": "Assign static version strings to variables for version tracking.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to 'ver' and 'selfver'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns fixed version strings to variables without any dynamic behavior, external input, or suspicious constructs. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. The code is simple, benign, and standard for version declaration. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static assignment of version strings with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
