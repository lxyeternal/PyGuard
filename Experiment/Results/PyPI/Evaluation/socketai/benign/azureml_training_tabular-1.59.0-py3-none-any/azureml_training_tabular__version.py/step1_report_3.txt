  "purpose": "Store version information in variables, likely for version checking or compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string values to variables 'ver' and 'selfver'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no flow analysis applicable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple variable assignment with static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two variables with version strings. There is no indication of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. No suspicious code patterns or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward version assignment, typical in package version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely stores version strings in variables for potential use elsewhere.",
