{
  "purpose": "Assigning version strings to variables, likely for version comparison or compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to variables 'ver' and 'selfver'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version strings to variables. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communication. No indicators of malicious behavior such as credential handling, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be standard version variable assignments, possibly part of a larger codebase for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as simple variable assignment for version tracking. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
