  "anomalies": "Code consists of only variable assignments with hardcoded version strings; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns fixed version strings to two variables. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no sensitive data handling, nor any suspicious logic. This appears to be a standard version declaration snippet with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to set version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
