  "purpose": "Utility functions for model evaluation metrics, label encoding/decoding, prediction padding, and related data processing within ML pipelines.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays, class labels, and optional transformers; accesses constants and logs information.",
  "sinks": "No external network, file system, or system commands; primarily data transformations and logging.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding, decoding, padding, and metric calculation functions; no external or malicious sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML utility tasks such as label encoding, prediction padding, metric calculation, and data validation. It uses common libraries (numpy, sklearn) and includes exception handling and logging for robustness. No network activity, file I/O, or system modifications are present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. The exception handling and logging are typical for debugging and auditing, not malicious intent. Overall, the code aligns with legitimate evaluation utilities and does not exhibit any security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for ML model evaluation, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (0.1), justified by standard validation and logging practices.",
