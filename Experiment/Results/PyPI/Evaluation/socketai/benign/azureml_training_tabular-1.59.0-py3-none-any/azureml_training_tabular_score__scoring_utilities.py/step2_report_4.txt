  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard utility functions for model evaluation, label encoding/decoding, padding, and metrics.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are typical for ML evaluation; no external or malicious sinks are evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Logging is for debugging/auditing.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low), confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's purpose. No malicious activity detected. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for evaluation, with standard data transformations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network, file I/O, or system commands; data flows are typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is a typical evaluation utility with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar evaluation utilities, handling predictions and labels.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external malicious activity; data transformations are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard evaluation code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is benign and well-understood. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for model evaluation, label handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system calls or network activity; data flows are typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious signals; the score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard evaluation utilities, data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external malicious activity; data flows are typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears benign and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, all reports describe standard evaluation utilities.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** No significant logical flaws or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, justified by the analysis.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, consistent with utility code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to logging of potentially sensitive info, but overall very safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for model evaluation, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
