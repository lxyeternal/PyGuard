  "purpose": "Utilities for computing model evaluation metrics, including data preprocessing, encoding, decoding, and metric calculation functions for classification, regression, and forecasting models.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (e.g., y_test, y_pred, class_labels, train_labels, sample_weight, y_transformer) and external modules (numpy, sklearn).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code uses data transformations and metric calculations without external network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (sources) is processed through functions like pad_predictions, label encoding/decoding, and metric calculations. Encoded/decoded labels flow from transformers to metrics for evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code includes standard data validation, logging, and exception handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No network or system modification calls identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard evaluation tasks: padding predictions, encoding/decoding labels, calculating metrics, and managing data safely for model evaluation. It has robust error handling and logging. The functions rely solely on established libraries like numpy and sklearn without executing external commands or network calls. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware-like operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate utility functions for model evaluation with no malicious intent. It performs data processing and metric calculations securely and transparently. No indicators of malware, sabotage, or security risks are detected.",
