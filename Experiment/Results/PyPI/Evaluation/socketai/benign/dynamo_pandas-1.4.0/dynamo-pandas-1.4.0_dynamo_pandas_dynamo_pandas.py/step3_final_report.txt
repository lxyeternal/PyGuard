  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve and insert data between DynamoDB tables and pandas DataFrames, facilitating data analysis and storage.",
  "sources": "External functions get_items, get_all_items, put_items; data input from DynamoDB queries or DataFrame conversions.",
  "sinks": "Data returned as DataFrame objects; data written back to DynamoDB via put_items.",
  "flows": "Input keys or full table scans → get_items/get_all_items → _to_df → DataFrame; DataFrame → _to_items → put_items → DynamoDB.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard pandas and boto3 interactions for DynamoDB data handling. It relies on external functions whose implementations are not provided; assuming they are standard and secure. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The data flow is straightforward, with no network anomalies or data leaks. The risk and malware scores are low, consistent with the benign nature of the code. External dependencies are the primary concern but are outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data access layer for DynamoDB with pandas, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is minimal. External functions should be reviewed separately for comprehensive security assurance.",
