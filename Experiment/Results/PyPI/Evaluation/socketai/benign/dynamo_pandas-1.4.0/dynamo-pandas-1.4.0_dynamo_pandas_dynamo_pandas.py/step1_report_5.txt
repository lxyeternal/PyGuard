  "purpose": "This code provides functions to interact with DynamoDB tables, allowing retrieval of data as pandas DataFrames and updating tables with DataFrame data.",
  "sources": "Reads from function parameters (e.g., table names, keys, attributes, DataFrames), and internal function calls to get_items, get_all_items, and pandas DataFrame methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to get_items, get_all_items, and pandas DataFrame methods, which handle data transformations and database interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., table names, keys, DataFrames) flow into get_items or get_all_items functions, then data is converted into DataFrames via _to_df, or from DataFrames to dictionary items via _to_items. Data is then written to DynamoDB via put_items.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obscure code structures detected. No evidence of obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. Functions appear to use external dependencies (pandas, boto3, internal modules) in standard ways. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or network communications are present within this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides standard data access and transformation functions for DynamoDB tables. It uses external, well-known libraries (pandas, boto3) in a typical manner. The functions rely on other modules (transactions) for data retrieval, but those are not included here. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are visible. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system disruption code is present. The functions perform data conversion and database operations normally. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate data management code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for DynamoDB interactions with pandas DataFrames, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. It handles data reading and writing in a typical, secure manner.",
