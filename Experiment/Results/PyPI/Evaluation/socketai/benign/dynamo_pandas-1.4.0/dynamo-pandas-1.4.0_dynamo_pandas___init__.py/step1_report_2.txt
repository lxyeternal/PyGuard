{
  "purpose": "This code is exporting specific functions and variables from the dynamo_pandas module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module .dynamo_pandas: get_df, keys, put_df",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing or output mechanisms visible",
  "flows": "Imported functions and variables are exposed via __all__, but no execution or data flow is shown",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; the version string is standard",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions and variables from a local module and defines an export list and version string. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing happening in this fragment. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are apparent, and the code appears to be a typical module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard module export interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply re-exports functions from a local module and defines a version string, which is typical for package versioning and API exposure.",
