{
  "purpose": "The code defines module imports and exports for a package related to DynamoDB and Pandas integration.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.dynamo_pandas' for functions 'get_df', 'keys', and 'put_df'. It also defines '__version__' and '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or data flows to untrusted sources, as the code only performs imports and attribute definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; purely static import/export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and module attribute definitions, standard in Python packages. No input handling, no data processing, and no external network or file interactions are present. The code appears to be a simple, safe module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only sets up imports and exports for the package, with no suspicious or harmful code detected.",
