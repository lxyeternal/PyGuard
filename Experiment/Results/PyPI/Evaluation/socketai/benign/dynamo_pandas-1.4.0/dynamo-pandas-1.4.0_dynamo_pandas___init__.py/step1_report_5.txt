  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a package, exposing functions get_df, keys, put_df, and the version number.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .dynamo_pandas for get_df, keys, put_df; assignment of __version__ and __all__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns in the import statements or assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions from a local module and declares module-level metadata (__version__, __all__). It does not contain any logic, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard module export setup without suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply exposes selected functions and version info.",
