{
  "purpose": "To re-export specific functions and variables from the 'dynamo_pandas' module, providing a simplified interface for users.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local 'dynamo_pandas' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input, as the code only imports and exports identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, only re-exporting functions and setting version info. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions or variables from a local module and then defines the module's version and public API. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no interaction with external data sources or sinks. It appears to be a simple, well-structured module interface file with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module interface setup with no malicious or security concerns. It does not perform any operations beyond importing and exporting identifiers, and there are no signs of malicious behavior.",
