  "purpose": "The code exports functions and variables from a local module 'dynamo_pandas' for external use, likely as part of a package interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.dynamo_pandas' (get_df, keys, put_df).",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'dynamo_pandas' functions to the module's exports; no untrusted input or external data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, mainly defining exports and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from a local module and sets up a list of exports along with a version string. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The code appears standard for a package's __init__.py or module setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple interface for importing functions from 'dynamo_pandas'. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
