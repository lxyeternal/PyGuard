{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module interface, re-exporting specific functions and variables from the local 'dynamo_pandas' module, and defining version and export list for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.dynamo_pandas' module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to untrusted sources or sinks",
  "flows": "N/A; static import and export only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module interface, importing functions 'get_df', 'keys', 'put_df' from a local module, setting a version string, and defining '__all__' for public API. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, external data handling, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is purely structural, facilitating module exports. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module interface with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. All reports correctly identify this, and their scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
