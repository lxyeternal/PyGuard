{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for DynamoDB-related functions, including put, get, and batch operations, utilizing mock data and AWS SDK mocking to verify functionality without external dependencies.",
  "sources": "Test data imported from 'test_data' modules; data inputs are controlled within test functions; no external untrusted sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Interactions with DynamoDB via boto3, all within mocked environments; no external network or untrusted data is processed outside of mocks.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke DynamoDB operations with controlled inputs; data flows from test data through function calls into mocked AWS SDK methods, with no external data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; use of base64 encoding for large payloads is standard in testing scenarios.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured set of unit tests for DynamoDB operations, employing mocks to isolate tests from real AWS services. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flows are contained within the test environment, and no external untrusted data is processed. The use of mock patches and controlled test data indicates a safe testing context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard test suite for DynamoDB interactions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the testing nature but does not indicate any security concern.",
