  "purpose": "Re-export functions from the local .transactions module for API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .transactions module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external calls",
  "flows": "Import functions -> __all__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward re-export pattern with no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and re-exports them via __all__, serving as an API surface. No data processing, dynamic execution, network activity, or embedded secrets are present. The code is minimal, clear, and follows standard practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard module re-export pattern with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
