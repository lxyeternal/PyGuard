  "sources": "Imports from the local .transactions module: get_all_items, get_item, get_items, put_item, put_items",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external calls present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; this code only imports and exports functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward imports and an export list (__all__). It only re-exports functions from a local module. No data processing, no external calls, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module re-export pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The code appears safe and conventional.",
