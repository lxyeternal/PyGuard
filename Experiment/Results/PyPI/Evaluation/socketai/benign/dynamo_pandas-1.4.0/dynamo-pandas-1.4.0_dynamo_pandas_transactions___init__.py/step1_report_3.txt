{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific functions from the 'transactions' module for external use",
  "sources": "Imports from the '.transactions' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; only defines __all__ for module exports",
  "flows": "Imported functions are listed in __all__, no data flow beyond exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions from a local module named 'transactions' and defines an __all__ list to specify public API. It does not perform any input handling, data processing, or network operations. The code is minimal and straightforward, focusing solely on module organization without executing any logic or containing embedded data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, backdoors, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export pattern with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger package structure aimed at organizing API functions.",
