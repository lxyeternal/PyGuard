  "purpose": "Re-exporting functions from the .transactions module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .transactions module: get_all_items, get_item, get_items, put_item, put_items.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; code only re-exports functions without processing or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward module re-exporting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module named transactions and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or complex logic. The code structure is standard for Python modules and appears safe. It does not include any embedded network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard re-export of functions from a local module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as an API surface for other modules or applications to interact with transaction-related functions safely.",
