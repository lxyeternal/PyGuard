  "purpose": "Define and expose TypeDeserializer and TypeSerializer classes for serialization/deserialization functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module .serde, which loads these classes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Imports from .serde (source) to __all__ declaration (sink) via the module's namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a relative module, then declares them as public API elements in __all__. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data sources are involved. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a Python package's interface module.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard export of serialization/deserialization classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and benign.",
