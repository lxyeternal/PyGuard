{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from a local 'serde' package and defines an export list for these classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local 'serde' module for 'TypeDeserializer' and 'TypeSerializer'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input; no external data or user input handling is present.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import classes from local module and define exports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code structure is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing specific classes from a local module and defining __all__ for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious patterns. The absence of dynamic execution, network activity, or file operations suggests it's a typical module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import/export pattern with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
