  "purpose": "Re-export module exposing TypeDeserializer and TypeSerializer classes from the local serde module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .serde module for TypeDeserializer and TypeSerializer.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import and export only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of importing two classes from a local module and exposing them via __all__. There are no data flows, user inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code follows standard Python module patterns and shows no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and minimal security risk scores. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify these assessments. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export pattern with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
