  "purpose": "Re-exports of TypeDeserializer and TypeSerializer modules for external use",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.serde)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present, as there is no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard import and export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes or functions from a local module (.serde) and then defines __all__ for public API exposure. There is no user input, data processing, or network activity. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal and appears to serve as an API re-export module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for re-exporting specific components, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
