{
  "purpose": "Exports TypeDeserializer and TypeSerializer from the serde module for use in other parts of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from a local module (.serde). No external input data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only re-exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two classes from a local module and sets the __all__ attribute to expose them for external use. There are no inputs, outputs, network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The structure and content appear standard and typical for Python package exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is standard and benign.",
