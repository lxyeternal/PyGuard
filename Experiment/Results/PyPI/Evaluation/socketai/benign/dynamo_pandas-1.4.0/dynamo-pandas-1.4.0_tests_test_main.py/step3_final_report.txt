{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests and data conversion functions for the 'dynamo_pandas' library, primarily used for testing DynamoDB interactions, data transformations, and pandas DataFrame handling.",
  "sources": "Test data from 'test_df', mock AWS SDK calls, and internal function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks; data flows within test scope and into pandas DataFrames.",
  "flows": "Test data sources flow into functions like get_df, _to_df, and _to_items, with AWS interactions mocked or parameterized.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of testing utilities employing standard practices such as mocks and controlled test data. No malicious behaviors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. External AWS calls are properly mocked, and data handling is within expected safe bounds.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard test suite for data handling functions, with high confidence in its safety.",
