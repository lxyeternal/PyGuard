  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with DynamoDB, including get, put, batch, and scan operations, supporting pandas/numpy data types.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'key', 'keys', 'item', 'table', and 'attributes' where data is received for processing.",
  "sinks": "AWS DynamoDB via boto3's resource and client methods, where data is sent for storage or retrieval.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through serialization/deserialization functions into AWS SDK API calls, and responses are processed back into Python data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Serialization and batch processing are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard DynamoDB data access patterns using boto3, with proper handling of serialization for pandas/numpy types. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The functions perform data retrieval and storage with appropriate batching and pagination. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The data flows are typical for such utility modules, and no secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured DynamoDB utility module with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to deployment environment and AWS credentials, which are outside the code scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
