{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project called 'dynamo-pandas'. It defines package metadata, reads files, and configures installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads '__init__.py' to extract metadata; reads 'README.md' for long description; no external input sources or untrusted data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard setup() function from setuptools; writes no data, executes no system commands, and does not handle untrusted data in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents to extract metadata and package description, then feeds these into the setup() call; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup script patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files (__init__.py and README.md) to gather metadata for packaging. It performs pattern matching to extract version info. The use of standard library functions and well-known packaging practices reduces risk. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The code is well-structured and conventional for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign and typical setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
