{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the content of __init__.py to extract metadata (__version__); reads README.md for long description; and reads files for package setup.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources are used that could lead to code execution or data leaks. The setup process does not incorporate user input or external untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The script reads files to gather metadata, which are then used in the setup function to configure package installation; no untrusted data flows from user input or network sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is a straightforward package setup script without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and uses them to read files and extract package metadata. The 'read' function reads files synchronously. 'find_meta' uses regex to extract version info. The setup function uses these values along with static metadata to configure package installation. All operations are standard for Python package setup and do not involve processing untrusted data or executing dynamic code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution without external inputs or sensitive operations.",
