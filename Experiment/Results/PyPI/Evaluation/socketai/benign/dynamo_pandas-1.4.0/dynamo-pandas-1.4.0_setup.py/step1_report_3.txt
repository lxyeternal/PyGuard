{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'dynamo-pandas' that reads package metadata and configures package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the package's __init__.py file for metadata, reads README.md for long description, and reads package files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup to process package installation; no untrusted data is directly processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Metadata read from files (metadata extraction functions) flows into setup configuration, with no external or untrusted data influencing execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. The script performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata and README content, then configures package installation with standard parameters. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input are present. Functions are straightforward and serve common packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs typical setup tasks safely and predictably.",
