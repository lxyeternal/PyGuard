  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` for a Python package called `dynamo-pandas`.\n- It reads local files (`__init__.py`, `README.md`) to extract metadata and description.\n- Uses regex to find the `__version__` string.\n- Calls `setuptools.setup()` with the gathered data.\n- No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and follows common packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are identified in the code. All reports agree that the code is standard, benign, and performs typical setup tasks.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes:** No errors, flaws, or suspicious logic are evident. The reports correctly identify that the code is conventional and safe.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports indicate no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified. The code is purely for package setup, with no security concerns.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The regex used in `find_meta()` could potentially be problematic if the `__init__.py` contains malicious code, but this is standard practice and unlikely.\n- No external data is fetched or executed.\n- No untrusted data flows into the setup process.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis: 0 malware, 0 obfuscated, 0 security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code does not execute any untrusted code, nor does it handle external inputs.\n- The regex for version extraction is standard and safe.\n- The code's purpose is clear, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No changes needed.",
