{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'dynamo-pandas' Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads local files (__init__.py and README.md) for metadata; uses regex to extract version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; data flows are static and confined to local file reading and package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> extracts metadata -> passes data to setuptools.setup() without external or dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script that reads local files for package metadata, extracts version info via regex, and calls setuptools.setup() with static data. It does not process untrusted input, execute external commands, or connect to networks. The regex is straightforward, and the overall structure is predictable and safe. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify it as benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
