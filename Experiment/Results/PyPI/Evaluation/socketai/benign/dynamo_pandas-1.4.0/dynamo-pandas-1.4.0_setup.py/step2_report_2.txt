  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Correctly identifies the code as a setup script.  \n- Sources & Flows: No untrusted data or external inputs involved.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Accurate; the code is standard, straightforward, and safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Same as above, no external or untrusted data.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No dangerous operations or data flows.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code or behavior.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly identifies the code as benign.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Same, reading local files for metadata.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No external data or unsafe operations.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Properly assesses as standard, safe setup code.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Same pattern, reading local files.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No external or untrusted data.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly identifies as a benign setup script.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Same, standard package setup.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No external data or dangerous operations.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code detected.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Properly classifies as a typical setup script.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nAll reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward, benign setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature.\n\n**My independent estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-founded. The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
