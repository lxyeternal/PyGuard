  "purpose": "Extend DynamoDB type serialization/deserialization to support pandas and numpy data types with custom handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for boto3 DynamoDB types, numpy, pandas; class methods accessing data types and values.",
  "sinks": "Type serialization and deserialization methods, converting data types to DynamoDB format and back.",
  "flows": "Input data (pandas/numpy types) → _get_dynamodb_type/_deserialize_n methods → serialized/deserialized data.",
  "anomalies": "Custom handling of pandas and numpy special types; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends existing boto3 DynamoDB type handlers to include support for pandas and numpy data types, with explicit conversions for NaN, NA, timestamps, timedeltas, and numeric types. It serializes data to DynamoDB-compatible formats and deserializes numbers to int or float accordingly. No external inputs, user inputs, or network operations are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic is identified. The code appears to be a legitimate extension for data handling, with careful type management. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward extension of boto3 DynamoDB type handling to support pandas/numpy data types, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a legitimate utility module with no harmful intent.",
