  "purpose": "Extend boto3 DynamoDB type serializer/deserializer to support pandas and numpy data types with custom handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for boto3, numpy, pandas; class methods accessing and transforming data types.",
  "sinks": "None evident; data transformations and type conversions are standard.",
  "flows": "Input data from pandas/numpy types → _get_dynamodb_type / _deserialize_n methods → serialized/deserialized output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of type conversions and data handling appears normal. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing boto3 DynamoDB type handling to include pandas and numpy data types, implementing custom serialization/deserialization. It performs type checks, conversions, and formatting, all in a straightforward manner. No malicious activities, suspicious data leaks, or covert behaviors are detected. The logic is focused on data type conversion, with safe and typical operations. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or system manipulations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension for handling pandas/numpy data types in DynamoDB serialization/deserialization. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The functions are standard, and the modifications are typical for data processing tasks.",
