  "purpose": "Extend boto3 DynamoDB type serialization/deserialization to support pandas and numpy data types.",
  "sources": "Imports from boto3, numpy, pandas; class methods that process input data types.",
  "sinks": "Methods that serialize data to DynamoDB types, especially _serialize_n and _serialize_s; deserialization in _deserialize_n.",
  "flows": "Input data from pandas/numpy sources flows into serialization methods, which convert to DynamoDB types; deserialization converts DynamoDB string/numeric data back to Python types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of type conversions is standard, with support for pandas/numpy data types. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors found.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing boto3 DynamoDB type serializer/deserializer classes to handle pandas and numpy data types. It includes methods for converting pandas NA/NaT to NULL, pandas timestamps/timedelta to strings, and numpy/numerical types to DynamoDB types. The deserializer converts numeric strings to float or int accordingly. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard library functions and is consistent with typical data serialization tasks. No signs of obfuscation or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. All operations are typical data type conversions for DynamoDB interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of DynamoDB type handling to support pandas and numpy data types. It performs standard serialization/deserialization with no suspicious or malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
