  "purpose": "Extend boto3 DynamoDB type serializer and deserializer to support pandas data types, including custom handling for NaN, NA, timestamps, and numeric conversions.",
  "sources": "Imports from boto3.dynamodb.types and numpy/pandas libraries, class definitions with methods for serialization/deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Serialization methods (_serialize_n, _serialize_s) converting data to DynamoDB format, deserialization method (_deserialize_n) converting DynamoDB data back to Python types.",
  "flows": "Input data (possibly pandas/numpy types) flows into _get_dynamodb_type and _serialize_* methods, then into DynamoDB-compatible formats; data read from DynamoDB flows into _deserialize_n, converting back to Python types.",
  "anomalies": "Support for pandas NA/NaT and timestamp types, custom numeric serialization, and conversion from DynamoDB numbers to int or float—nothing suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends existing boto3 DynamoDB type serialization/deserialization to handle pandas and numpy data types, including NaN, NA, timestamps, and numeric conversions. It performs type checks and converts pandas-specific types into DynamoDB-compatible formats. The deserializer converts numeric strings into float or int, depending on whether they have fractional parts. No external data sources, no network operations, and no code that interacts with sensitive system components. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard data serialization practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe extension of boto3 DynamoDB type handling to support pandas and numpy data types. It contains no malicious, backdoor, or suspicious logic, and its purpose is clearly related to data serialization/deserialization. The overall security risk is negligible.",
