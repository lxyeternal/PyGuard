  "purpose": "Define interfaces and protocols for cache key building and backend cache operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements (starlette.requests, starlette.responses, typing_extensions), class method signatures, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially untrusted data outputs; code mainly defines interfaces and types.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only defines abstract classes and protocols without data flow implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract classes and protocols defining cache-related behaviors and a key builder interface. It imports common modules, and the class methods are purely abstract with no implementation, input/output handling, or data processing. There are no apparent data flows, external input handling, or operations that could be malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or security issues are present. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface definition for caching mechanisms and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to be part of a larger, legitimate project.",
