{
  "purpose": "This code defines protocols and abstract classes for a caching backend system, including key-building logic and cache operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters (__function, __namespace, request, response, args, kwargs) in the KeyBuilder Protocol, and internal method calls within Backend's abstract methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include method implementations that could store or retrieve data, but no direct data leak points or untrusted data flows are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (__function, request, response, args, kwargs) to key generation in KeyBuilder, and from cache methods (get, set, clear) to storage or retrieval operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is standard for a cache interface.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Protocol for key building and an abstract Backend class for cache operations, with no implementation details. It relies on standard typing and abstract methods, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. All data inputs are parameterized, and there are no signs of hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured interface for caching with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is designed for legitimate cache management tasks without evident security risks.",
