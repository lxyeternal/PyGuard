  "purpose": "Define protocols and abstract methods for a caching backend and key building for request/response handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, starlette.requests.Request, starlette.responses.Response, and typing_extensions.Protocol.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no I/O or external calls are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; code appears to be standard interface definitions and protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Backend' with methods for cache operations and a 'KeyBuilder' protocol for generating cache keys. It uses type hints and asynchronous method signatures. No input/output operations, network connections, or data manipulations are present. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to serve as a framework or interface for further implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code segment is a standard, benign set of interface definitions for cache handling and key generation. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident.",
