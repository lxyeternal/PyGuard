  "purpose": "Define interfaces and protocols for key management and backend cache storage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from starlette and typing_extensions, class and method definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks identified; the code sets up abstract classes and protocols only",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines abstract classes and protocols for cache key building and backend storage. It uses standard Python features, type hints, and starlette request/response objects. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or sensitive operations. The code appears to be a typical interface setup for a web application framework, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface definition for caching mechanisms, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
