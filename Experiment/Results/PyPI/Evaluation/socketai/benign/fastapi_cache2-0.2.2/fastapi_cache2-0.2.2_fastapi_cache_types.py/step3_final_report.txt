{
  "purpose": "Defines a Protocol for cache key generation and an abstract Backend class for cache operations, serving as interface definitions for cache management in a web application.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only defines interfaces and protocols without data input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing, external calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; as an interface, it does not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of interface definitions for cache key building and cache backend operations, with no implementation, data handling, or external interactions. It uses standard libraries and typing, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.2 or 0), reflecting the non-executable, structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of interface definitions for cache management, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
