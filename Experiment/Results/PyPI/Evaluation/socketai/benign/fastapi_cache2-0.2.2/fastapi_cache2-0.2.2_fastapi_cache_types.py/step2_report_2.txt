  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any signs of malicious activity, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of interface definitions: Protocols and abstract classes for cache key building and backend cache operations.\n- All methods are abstract, with no implementation details, network calls, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external data flows are present.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and common web framework components (starlette.requests, starlette.responses).\n- The purpose appears to be setting up a cache system interface, likely part of a larger web application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is purely interface definitions with no implementation, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. No vulnerabilities or malicious code are detectable here.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **In the report logic or reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is standard, benign, and contains no suspicious elements. They do not miss any hidden issues or malicious patterns.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a low risk (mostly 0.2 or 0), which aligns with the code being an interface with no active security issues.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- The code does not contain any executable logic, external calls, or data flows that could be exploited.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- The code is purely structural, defining interfaces for cache management.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The high confidence levels (mostly 1 or 0.9) are justified.\n- No changes needed for scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (or 0, if considering the code as completely benign)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard interface definition for cache systems, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minimal security risk score reflects that it is a benign framework component.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.2** (or 0 if stricter)\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is safe and purely structural.",
