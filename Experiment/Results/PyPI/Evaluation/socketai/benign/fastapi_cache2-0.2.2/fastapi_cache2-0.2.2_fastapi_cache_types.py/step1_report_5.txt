{
  "purpose": "Define protocols and abstract base classes for cache backend implementations and key building logic in a web framework context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party libraries (starlette, typing_extensions), and class/method definitions. No user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code defines interfaces and protocols without executing data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears standard for defining abstract classes and protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Protocol for key building functions and an abstract base class for cache backends, including methods for get, set, get_with_ttl, and clear operations. All methods are abstract and raise NotImplementedError, indicating no implementation details that could contain malicious behavior. No input/output, network calls, or data handling occurs here. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface and protocol definition for caching mechanisms within a web framework, with no malicious behavior or security risks present. It is safe and appears to serve as a foundation for further implementation.",
