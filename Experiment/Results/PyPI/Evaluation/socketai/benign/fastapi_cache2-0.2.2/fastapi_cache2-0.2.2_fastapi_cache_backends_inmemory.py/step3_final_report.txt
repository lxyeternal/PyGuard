  "purpose": "In-memory cache backend managing data with TTL, ensuring thread safety and data expiration.",
  "sources": "Reads from internal _store dictionary, current time via time.time().",
  "sinks": "Modifies _store by adding, deleting entries; deletes expired entries during get.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (key, value, expire) flow into _store with TTL calculation; get operations read and delete expired entries.",
  "anomalies": "The set() method uses 'self._now + (expire or 0)', which causes immediate expiration if 'expire' is None; this may be unintended.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward in-memory cache with TTL, using asyncio.Lock for concurrency. It correctly manages expiration and thread safety. No external data sinks or malicious code are present. The TTL logic defaults to immediate expiration when 'expire' is None, which could be a logic flaw but not a security issue. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1). The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign in-memory cache implementation with proper TTL and concurrency control. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The minor TTL default behavior may be a logic oversight but does not pose security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
