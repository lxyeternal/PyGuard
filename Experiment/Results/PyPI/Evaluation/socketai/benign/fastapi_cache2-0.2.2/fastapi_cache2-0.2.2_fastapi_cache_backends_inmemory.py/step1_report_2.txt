  "purpose": "Implementing an in-memory cache backend for FastAPI with TTL support, providing get, set, and clear operations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters: key, value, expire, namespace. No external input sources such as network, environment variables, or files are present.",
  "sinks": "Stores data in an internal dictionary (_store). No external sinks or outputs are present beyond the in-memory data store.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (key, value, expire, namespace) are used to modify or access _store; data retrieval and deletion are performed via method calls manipulating _store.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Use of asyncio.Lock for concurrency control is standard; no signs of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple in-memory caching mechanism with standard get/set/clear methods. Uses time-based expiry for cache entries. Locking ensures thread safety. No external data sources or suspicious behavior observed. No code injection, data leakage, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward cache implementation intended for normal application use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard in-memory cache backend implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical cache operations securely and without obfuscation. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
