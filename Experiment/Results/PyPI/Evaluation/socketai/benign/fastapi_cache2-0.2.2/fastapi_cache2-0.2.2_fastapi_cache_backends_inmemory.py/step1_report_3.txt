{
  "purpose": "Implementing an in-memory cache backend for FastAPI with thread-safe get/set/clear operations.",
  "sources": "Reading the current time via time.time(), accessing and modifying self._store dictionary, reading and writing class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential modification or deletion of cache entries in self._store; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys, values, expiration time) flow into set; keys are read in get and _get; data returned accordingly; clear modifies internal store based on namespace or key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of async lock and cache management appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a thread-safe in-memory cache backend for FastAPI, managing cache entries with TTL. It uses asyncio Lock for concurrency control, with standard get, set, and clear operations. No external input is processed beyond standard method parameters, and no external data sinks are present. The logic appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard thread-safe in-memory cache backend with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical cache operations safely, with no suspicious behaviors observed.",
