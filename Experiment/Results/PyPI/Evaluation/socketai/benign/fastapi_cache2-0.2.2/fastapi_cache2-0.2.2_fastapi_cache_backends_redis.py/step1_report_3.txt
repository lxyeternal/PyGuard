  "purpose": "Implement a Redis cache backend for FastAPI applications supporting both Redis and RedisCluster.",
  "sources": "Reading data from Redis (get, ttl, eval, delete) and input parameters (keys, namespace, key).",
  "sinks": "Redis commands executing potentially untrusted data (eval with user-controlled namespace).",
  "flows": "Input parameters (keys, namespace) flow into Redis commands, especially eval, delete, get, ttl.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Lua script in clear method with dynamic namespace insertion; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a backend class interfacing with Redis or RedisCluster, providing methods for get, set, clear, and get_with_ttl. It employs standard Redis commands and constructs. The eval command uses a Lua script to delete keys matching a namespace pattern, which is a legitimate Redis operation. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors like data exfiltration or system compromise. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a cache backend with proper async handling. The use of user-supplied namespace and key parameters is typical for cache management and does not inherently introduce malicious activity, provided the inputs are controlled or validated elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Redis backend implementation with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The dynamic eval usage is normal for namespace-based cache clearing. No malware or security risks are apparent.",
