  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code conditionally imports optional cache backends and updates `__all__`. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the standard pattern of optional imports. No malicious activity is indicated or suspected. The slight risk score might account for the dynamic import pattern, but this is common and safe here.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed. The reasoning and scoring are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe, standard dynamic imports with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The score of zero for malware and risk is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward pattern for optional dependencies, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The consistent scoring aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, standard optional dependency handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code; the scoring reflects this.\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign; the scoring is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No changes.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; remains at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and structure, the risk score should be very low, close to 0, as the code is standard for optional dependency loading.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nI would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the benign, standard pattern of optional imports.\n\n**In summary:**\nThe code is a typical pattern for managing optional dependencies in Python modules. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious logic. The current scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
