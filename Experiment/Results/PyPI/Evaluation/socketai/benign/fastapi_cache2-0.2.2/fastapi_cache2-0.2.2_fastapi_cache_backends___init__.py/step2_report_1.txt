  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code uses standard try-except blocks for optional imports, modifying __all__ accordingly. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low). The security risk is minimal, as the code simply manages optional dependencies.\n- **Validity:** The reasoning appears sound; no issues with the code logic or potential for malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar pattern, straightforward conditional imports with no data leaks or untrusted data handling. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Validity:** Well-founded; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the same safe pattern, with no signs of malicious activity. The pattern is standard for optional dependencies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.\n- **Validity:** The reasoning is consistent and correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard pattern with no suspicious behavior. No untrusted data or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.\n- **Validity:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, safe and standard for optional dependency inclusion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.\n- **Validity:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard pattern for optional dependency loading. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware=0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low risk scores (0 or 0.1). Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not execute any untrusted code beyond importing known modules.\n- It handles missing modules gracefully.\n- No sensitive data, secrets, or obfuscation is involved.\n- The pattern is common and well-understood.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if you want to be very cautious, but 0 is justified)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.**",
