  "purpose": "Manage optional cache backend dependencies by conditionally importing modules and updating the public API list.",
  "sources": "Import statements within try-except blocks for dynamodb, memcached, redis modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; import statements are safe and limited to module loading.",
  "flows": "Attempted import of each optional backend module; if successful, module name added to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python pattern for optional dependencies, with try-except to handle missing modules, updating __all__ accordingly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The pattern is common and safe, with no untrusted data processing or code execution beyond module imports. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low risk scores. The logic is straightforward, and the code is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for optional dependency management in Python. It poses no security risks or malicious intent, and the reports' assessments are accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
