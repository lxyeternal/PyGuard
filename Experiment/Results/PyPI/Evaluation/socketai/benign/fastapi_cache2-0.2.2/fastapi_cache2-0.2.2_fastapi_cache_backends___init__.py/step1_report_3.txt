{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports various caching backend modules from the 'fastapi_cache.backends' package and conditionally includes them in the module's export list (__all__), enabling flexible backend support depending on available dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'fastapi_cache.backends' modules and the 'import' errors caught in try-except blocks.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or untrusted code execution are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are attempted for each backend; if successful, the backend name is added to __all__, without executing any untrusted code or data flow beyond module import validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code uses dynamic imports but in a safe, standard pattern for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a list __all__ with core exports. It then attempts to import optional backends (dynamodb, memcached, redis). If the imports succeed, their names are added to __all__. Error handling prevents ImportError exceptions from stopping execution. This pattern allows optional support for various backends based on installed dependencies. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data leaks. The code follows standard Python practices for optional dependency management, with no suspicious logic or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe dependency loader that manages optional imports for backend support in a caching system. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this code fragment.",
