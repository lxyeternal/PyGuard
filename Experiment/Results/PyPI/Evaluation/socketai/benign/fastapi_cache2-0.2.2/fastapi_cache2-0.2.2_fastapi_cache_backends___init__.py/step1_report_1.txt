{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports different cache backend modules for the fastapi_cache package and updates the __all__ list accordingly to specify publicly accessible components.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __all__ list, import statements within try-except blocks, and the imported modules (fastapi_cache.backends.dynamodb, memcached, redis).",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the dynamic import statements, which could potentially execute malicious or unintended code if the modules are compromised or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code flows from attempting to import optional modules, adding their names to __all__, and relies on the successful import to modify the exported API surface.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated behavior. The dynamic import pattern is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code safely attempts to import optional backend modules for caching. It handles ImportError gracefully, avoiding crashes if modules are missing. The dynamic addition to __all__ is conventional and does not introduce malicious behavior. The imports themselves are from known, expected package locations, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The use of try-except blocks ensures compatibility across environments with varying installed dependencies but does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for conditional importing of optional dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. There is a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
