{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports optional caching backend modules for the fastapi_cache package and updates the __all__ list accordingly.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fastapi_cache.backends' modules (inmemory, dynamodb, memcached, redis). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only performs conditional imports and list modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic import pattern based on import errors is typical for optional dependencies, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports optional backend modules for caching, updating the __all__ list accordingly. It uses try-except-else blocks to handle ImportError gracefully. The structure is standard for optional dependency loading. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The logic is straightforward, intended to include available backends for package use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for optional dependency inclusion, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves to dynamically include available modules without introducing security issues.",
