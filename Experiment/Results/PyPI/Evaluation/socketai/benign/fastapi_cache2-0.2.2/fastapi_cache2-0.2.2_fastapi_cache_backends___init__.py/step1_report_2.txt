{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports optional backend modules for fastapi_cache and manages the __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "The import statements within try-except blocks for fastapi_cache.backends modules such as dynamodb, memcached, and redis.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code only handles imports and modifies a list of exports.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import optional modules; if successful, adds their names to __all__ list; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks for optional imports is common; no hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing specific classes and defining the __all__ list. It then conditionally imports optional backend modules, extending __all__ only if imports succeed. This pattern ensures compatibility across different environments without risking execution of malicious code. No untrusted data sources or data flows are present. The code's logic is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dynamic import pattern for optional dependencies, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and unlikely to be used for malicious purposes.",
