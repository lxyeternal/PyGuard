  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code performs conditional imports and updates `__all__`. Notes that the pattern is standard and safe.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both set to 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Analysis Validity:** Accurate; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, which is reasonable given the straightforward pattern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Also correctly states that the code manages optional dependencies with try-except blocks, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the benign pattern.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the safe pattern of optional imports and `__all__` management, with no anomalies or malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** All zero, matching the code's behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1, fully aligned.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the pattern as standard for optional dependencies, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: standard optional dependency pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** The code performs straightforward, safe conditional imports with no untrusted data, no code execution beyond module loading, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Scores:** The overall security risk is minimal, given the benign pattern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** I agree with 0 across all reports. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and behavior, a risk score of 0.1 (from report 1) might be slightly high, but considering the dynamic import pattern, a conservative risk score of **0.0** is justified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code pattern is common and safe for managing optional dependencies.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities based on the provided code and reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's behavior.",
