  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n**1. Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n- The code attempts to import optional cache backend modules (`dynamodb`, `memcached`, `redis`) from `fastapi_cache.backends`.\n- If the import succeeds, it appends the module name to the `__all__` list, which controls what symbols are exported from the module.\n- The initial import of `inmemory` and `Backend` is straightforward.\n- The pattern used is a common Python approach for optional dependencies, handling `ImportError` gracefully.\n\n**2. Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard pattern for optional dependency inclusion.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code, is present.\n- The dynamic import mechanism is safe because it only attempts to import modules by name, without executing any untrusted code or data.\n- There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources influencing the import process.\n- The code does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it execute any code beyond importing known modules.\n\n**3. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and correctly identify that the code is safe and standard.\n- They correctly note the absence of anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n**4. Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.0 or 0.1), aligning with the safe pattern.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), reflecting the consensus that the code is benign.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n**5. Critical Evaluation of the Scores:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the pattern is a common, safe practice.\n\n**6. Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation for optional dependency management.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily because of the dynamic import pattern, which is standard and safe.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that dependencies themselves are trustworthy, but based on this code snippet and reports, the code logic is safe.",
