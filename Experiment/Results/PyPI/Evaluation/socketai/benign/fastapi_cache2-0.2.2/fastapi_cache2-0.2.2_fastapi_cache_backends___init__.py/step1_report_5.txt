{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports cache backend modules from the 'fastapi_cache' library and adds them to the __all__ list for exports, depending on their availability.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports and the __all__ list modifications.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data leaks or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements determine module availability, and __all__ is modified accordingly. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic import pattern based on optional dependencies is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for optional modules ('dynamodb', 'memcached', 'redis') from 'fastapi_cache.backends' and includes them in the __all__ list if available, allowing flexible export of cache backends. This pattern is a common way to support optional dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious logic. The code is straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that conditionally includes optional cache backends based on their availability. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The pattern is standard for optional dependency management in Python modules.",
