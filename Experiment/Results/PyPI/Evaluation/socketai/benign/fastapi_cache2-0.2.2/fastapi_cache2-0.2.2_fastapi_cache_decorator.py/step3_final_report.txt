  "purpose": "A caching decorator for FastAPI endpoints that manages cache retrieval, storage, and response headers to optimize performance and reduce backend load.",
  "sources": "Request object (for headers and method), function arguments, cache key generator, cache backend, response object (for headers).",
  "sinks": "Cache backend (get/set), response headers (Cache-Control, ETag, cache status), potential cache key generation.",
  "flows": "Request headers → cache decision logic → cache key generation → cache backend retrieval → cache hit/miss handling → response header updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard cache decorator pattern, handling both sync and async functions, with proper error handling and header management. It uses typical techniques for cache key creation, cache TTL, and ETag management. No malicious or obfuscated code elements are present. The logic aligns with common caching practices in FastAPI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured caching decorator with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It maintains low security risk and adheres to standard patterns.",
