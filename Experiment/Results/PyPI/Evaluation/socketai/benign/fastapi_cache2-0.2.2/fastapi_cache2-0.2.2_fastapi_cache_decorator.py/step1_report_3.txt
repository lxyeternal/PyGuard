{
  "purpose": "The code provides a caching decorator for FastAPI endpoints, allowing for automatic caching of responses with support for custom cache keys, expiration, and cache control headers.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, specifically the request and response objects, as well as parameters related to cache control and function metadata.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to cache backend, modifies response headers, and uses hash functions to generate ETags, which could be exploited if cache contents are manipulated or if backend access is compromised.",
  "flows": "Input request data is used to generate cache keys; cache retrieval from backend; cache hits modify response headers; cache misses result in function execution and cache storage; cache status updates depend on cache backend responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code employs standard caching patterns, proper async handling, and safe use of dependencies. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard caching decorator with input validation, signature augmentation, and cache management. It safely handles async and sync functions, retrieves and sets cache asynchronously, and updates response headers accordingly. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are observed. The logic appears to be a typical cache wrapper designed for performance enhancement in web APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a cache decorator for FastAPI with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected caching functions securely, with appropriate handling of request and response objects. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
