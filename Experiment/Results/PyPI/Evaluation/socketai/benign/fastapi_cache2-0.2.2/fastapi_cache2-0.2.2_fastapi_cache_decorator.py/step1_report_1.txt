{
  "purpose": "The code implements a caching decorator for FastAPI endpoints, allowing automatic caching of responses based on request parameters and configuration.",
  "sources": "Request and Response objects are retrieved from keyword arguments; cache keys are generated via key_builder; backend cache operations are performed through FastAPICache backend.",
  "sinks": "Cache get/set operations, hashing of cached content, and updating response headers with cache status and ETag.",
  "flows": "The request is inspected for cache control headers; cache key is generated; cache is checked for existing data; if cache miss, function executes and result is cached; on cache hit, cached data is used to respond; response headers are updated accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual or suspicious function calls. Usage of exception handling around cache operations is standard, and no data exfiltration or malicious network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages cache logic: it verifies if caching should occur, generates cache keys, and stores or retrieves responses. The only external interactions involve cache backend calls and hashing for ETag generation. No suspicious network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code relies on well-known libraries and standard practices. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. Functionality appears legitimate and focused on performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard caching decorator for FastAPI endpoints with no evidence of malicious behavior. It securely manages cache operations and response handling without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
