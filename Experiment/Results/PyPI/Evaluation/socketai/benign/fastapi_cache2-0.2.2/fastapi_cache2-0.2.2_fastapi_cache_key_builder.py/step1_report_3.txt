  "purpose": "Generate a cache key based on function details and arguments for caching purposes.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (func, args, kwargs, request, response), and the module and function names.",
  "sinks": "Hash calculation via hashlib.md5, and the return of a string cache key.",
  "flows": "Function arguments are combined into a string, encoded, hashed with md5, and returned as a cache key string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MD5 for hashing, which is considered insecure for cryptographic purposes, but here it is used for cache key generation, not security. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create cache keys by hashing function metadata and arguments. It uses standard libraries and type hints, with no external or suspicious input sources. No evidence of malicious data handling, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The use of md5 is acceptable here as it is only used for generating unique identifiers, not security purposes. No obfuscated code or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward cache key generator without malicious intent. It relies on standard libraries and common practices. No security risks or malware detected based on this code segment.",
