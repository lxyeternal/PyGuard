  "flows": "Concatenate function info and arguments -> encode -> hash -> return cache key.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MD5 hashing, which is cryptographically weak but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a cache key from function metadata and arguments. It uses MD5 hashing to produce the key, which is fast but insecure against collision attacks. No untrusted input is directly executed or transmitted; the code simply constructs and hashes a string. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code. The purpose appears to be benign cache key generation for caching mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious utility for cache key creation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security threats are evident.",
