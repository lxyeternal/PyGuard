{
  "purpose": "The code generates a cache key based on function details, request, response, and arguments.",
  "sources": "The function reads its parameters: func, args, kwargs, request, response, and namespace.",
  "sinks": "The hashlib.md5().hexdigest() output could be used for caching or tracking, but it does not directly leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Inputs (function parameters and request/response objects) are combined into a string, encoded, and hashed to produce a cache key.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a string from function module and name, arguments, and keyword arguments. It then computes an MD5 hash to generate a cache key, which is prefixed with a namespace. It does not perform any network activity, file system modification, or execute untrusted code. Use of MD5 for hashing is acceptable here for cache key purposes, although not recommended for security-sensitive contexts. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for cache key generation, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It only hashes function invocation details to produce a cache key.",
