  "purpose": "Generate a cache key based on function metadata and arguments, possibly for caching or memoization.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (func, args, kwargs), optional request and response objects.",
  "sinks": "hashlib.md5 hashing operation, which produces a hash from input string.",
  "flows": "Input data (func, args, kwargs, request, response) flows into the string being hashed, then into hashlib.md5, and finally outputs a hexadecimal hash string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of md5 hashing, which is generally not recommended for security-sensitive contexts but here appears intended for non-cryptographic caching purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a string from the function's module, name, positional arguments, and keyword arguments, then hashes it with MD5 to generate a cache key. The optional request and response objects are accepted but not used within the function, indicating potential extensibility. The hashing is used for generating cache keys, which is a common pattern. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The only notable point is the use of MD5, which is weak for cryptographic security but acceptable for non-security-critical cache key generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward cache key generator that uses MD5 hashing. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The use of MD5 is not security-sensitive here. Overall, it appears safe and intended for non-security purposes.",
