  "purpose": "Generate a cache key based on function metadata, arguments, and optional request/response objects.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: func, args, kwargs, request, response.",
  "sinks": "Hashing operation (md5) for the cache key, output returned as a string.",
  "flows": "Function parameters -> hashlib.md5 hashing -> cache key string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of md5 for hashing is generally insecure for cryptographic purposes but acceptable for cache keys; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a cache key string from function metadata, args, kwargs, and optionally request/response objects. It uses hashlib.md5 to hash the constructed string, which is common for cache key generation. No user input is directly used in sensitive operations, and there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and purpose-driven. The use of md5, while cryptographically weak, is acceptable in this context and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for cache key generation. No malicious behavior detected. It does not pose security risks related to malware or data leaks. The only note is the use of md5, which is acceptable here, but not recommended for security-critical cryptographic hashes.",
