  "purpose": "Generate cache keys based on function metadata, arguments, and optional request/response objects.",
  "sources": "Function's module and name, args, kwargs, optional request and response objects",
  "sinks": "Hashing operation (hashlib.md5), string concatenation",
  "flows": "Concatenate function metadata and arguments into a string -> encode -> hash with MD5 -> return cache key string",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code, no suspicious or malicious behavior; request and response parameters are unused but not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a string from function module, name, args, kwargs, and optional request/response, then hashes it with MD5 to produce a cache key. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The use of MD5 is weak cryptographically but acceptable for cache key purposes. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is simple, transparent, and aligns with standard cache key generation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The use of MD5 is acceptable in this context. All reports correctly identify the code's purpose and security posture. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
