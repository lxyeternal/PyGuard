{
  "purpose": "This code defines a caching utility class for FastAPI applications, enabling initialization, resetting, and managing cache backend configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from 'importlib.metadata', and data from class variables during method calls and assertions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the code interacts with cache backends and class attributes, primarily for configuration purposes.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting configuration via 'init', retrieving configurations through getter methods, and clearing cache via 'clear'. Data flows from inputs (method parameters, environment) into class variables, with no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The version retrieval uses standard package metadata. No malicious code or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a singleton-like cache configuration class, with standard class methods for initialization, reset, and data access. It uses assertions to enforce proper usage. No external data is processed insecurely, and no dynamic code execution or network communication occurs. The code appears clean and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration manager for a FastAPI caching system without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It relies on standard Python features and safe practices. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
