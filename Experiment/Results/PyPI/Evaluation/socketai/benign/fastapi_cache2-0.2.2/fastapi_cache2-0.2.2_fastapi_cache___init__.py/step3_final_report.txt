  "purpose": "This code manages cache configuration and operations for a FastAPI application, providing initialization, reset, and cache clearing functionalities with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Configuration inputs via init method parameters, external backend for cache clearing",
  "sinks": "Cache clearing method interacting with external backend, no untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters set internal state; clear method calls backend with namespace and key",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward singleton pattern for cache management, using assertions to enforce proper initialization. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The use of assertions for safety is standard, and no external data is processed insecurely. The code relies on external backend implementations, which are assumed to be trusted. The malware score is zero, as there are no signs of malicious intent. The obfuscation score is zero, given the clear and readable code. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2), primarily reflecting potential misconfiguration risks rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free from malware or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
