{
  "purpose": "This code defines a cache management class for FastAPI applications, allowing initialization, reset, and access to cache configuration and backend.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for initialization (backend, prefix, expire, coder, key_builder, cache_status_header, enable). Accessors for configuration values. The clear method reads backend and prefix for cache clearing.",
  "sinks": "The clear method interacts with the backend, potentially executing cache clearing commands. No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to init() are stored in class variables; get methods read these variables; clear() uses backend and prefix to perform cache clearing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or hidden backdoors. The code uses standard assertions and class variables, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward cache management class for FastAPI, with methods to initialize, reset, and access configuration. It interacts with a cache backend to clear cache entries. The code uses standard patterns, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The only notable point is the use of assertions that enforce the presence of backend and configuration values, which is typical for such classes. Overall, it shows no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a cache utility class for FastAPI with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond typical configuration handling. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to proper initialization and secure backend implementation.",
