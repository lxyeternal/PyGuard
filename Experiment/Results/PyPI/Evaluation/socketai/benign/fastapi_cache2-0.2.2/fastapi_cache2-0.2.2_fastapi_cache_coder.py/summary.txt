  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the unsafe use of pickle for serialization/deserialization without validation, which poses a high risk of remote code execution. While no malicious payloads are present in the current code, the potential for malicious exploitation is significant. The malware score should be increased to approximately 0.8, and the overall security risk to about 0.9. The code should be refactored to avoid untrusted pickle data or include strict validation and sandboxing measures."
