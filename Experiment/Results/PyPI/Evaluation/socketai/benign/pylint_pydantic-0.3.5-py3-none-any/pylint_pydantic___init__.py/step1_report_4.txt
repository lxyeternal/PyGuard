{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and transforms for analyzing and modifying Python code related to pydantic models, including decorator inference, class detection, and dependency listing.",
  "sources": "Potential sources of input are function and class nodes in the AST, especially decorators, subscript nodes, and inferred objects.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; the code primarily performs static analysis, transformations, and dependency listing without executing or writing data.",
  "flows": "The code infers decorator types from AST nodes, then applies transformations or checks for specific class or decorator names. It does not process untrusted external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions perform static AST analysis, inference, and registration for transformations. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports static analysis tools and performs various checks on Python AST nodes, particularly related to pydantic validators and configurations. It includes functions for determining decorator types, class inheritance, and applying code transformations. The code also provides a dependency list function. All functions use standard AST inference and transformations, with no runtime data processing or external communications. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or sabotage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static analysis utility designed for pylint plugin development targeting pydantic models. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on its static nature and purpose. The overall security risk score is low, with no malware indications.",
