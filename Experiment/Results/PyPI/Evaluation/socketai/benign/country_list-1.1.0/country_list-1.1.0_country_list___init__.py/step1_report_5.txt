  "purpose": "Exporting specific functions or variables from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'available_languages' and 'countries_for_language' from a relative module '.country_list'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only involves static imports and declaration of __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two symbols from a local module, likely for use elsewhere, and explicitly exports them via __all__. It contains no data processing, user input, network communication, or sensitive operations. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules. No obfuscated code, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and export of module symbols without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard module setup code.",
