{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific variables from a local module and re-exports them via __all__, serving as a module interface for available languages and countries.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .country_list module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no external data handling",
  "flows": "Import from local module to re-export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, standard Python module syntax for re-exporting symbols. It does not perform any dynamic execution, network activity, or data manipulation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import and export pattern is common and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature. Slightly higher risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are overly cautious given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The only adjustment needed is to set the security risk score to 0 across all reports, as there is no actual security concern.",
