{
  "purpose": "Exporting two functions or variables, 'available_languages' and 'countries_for_language', from the local module 'country_list' for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports 'available_languages' and 'countries_for_language' from a local module; defines '__all__' to specify exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output functions identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as there are no input or data handling operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a module-level import and defines the '__all__' list for export control. It does not execute any runtime logic, handle external input, or perform operations that could pose security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. The structure is straightforward and conforms to standard Python module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple module export definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a benign and standard pattern for Python modules.",
