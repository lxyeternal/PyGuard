{
  "purpose": "The code exports two objects, 'available_languages' and 'countries_for_language', from the 'country_list' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports 'available_languages' and 'countries_for_language' from a local module 'country_list'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'country_list' module into the current module and then are exposed via __all__, but no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious logic, or obfuscated code. The import path suggests a local module, and nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two variables or functions from a local module and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, no network activity, no handling of user input, and no suspicious constructs. The code appears to be standard for module export management in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module export pattern with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It merely re-exports symbols from a local module, which is common practice.",
