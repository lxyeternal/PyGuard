  "purpose": "Exporting available languages and country data related to languages from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .country_list module",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as there is no data processing or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import from local module to exported symbols",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions or variables from a relative module named 'country_list'. It then explicitly defines __all__ for module exports. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or untrusted data handling is present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard for module exports without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It merely re-exports components from a local module.",
