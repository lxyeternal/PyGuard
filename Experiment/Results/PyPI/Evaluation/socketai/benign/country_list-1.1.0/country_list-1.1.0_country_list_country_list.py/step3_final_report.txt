  "purpose": "Provides functions to list available country data languages and retrieve country information for a specific language, utilizing caching for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Directory listing of language folders, reading 'country.csv' files within those directories",
  "sinks": "CSV file reading operations, data returned to caller",
  "flows": "available_languages() reads directory names -> countries_for_language() reads specific CSV based on cleaned language name",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward directory and file operations",
  "analysis": "The code loads language-specific country data from CSV files, using caching to optimize repeated access. It normalizes input language strings and matches them against existing directories. Error handling is minimal but appropriate for missing languages. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation present. The code is simple, with potential minor issues like missing file handling or cache staleness, but no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malware. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2). No changes are necessary based on current information.",
