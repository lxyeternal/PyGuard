  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Potential Issues:**\n\n   - **Functionality:**\n     - The code reads country data files from a directory structure.\n     - `available_languages()` returns a sorted list of directory names that contain a `country.csv`.\n     - `countries_for_language()` retrieves country data for a given language, after cleaning the language string.\n     - `_clean_lang()` normalizes the input language string and matches it against available languages.\n\n   - **Potential issues:**\n     - **Caching:** Both functions use `lru_cache`, which is appropriate for performance but could cache stale data if the underlying files change. Not necessarily a security issue but worth noting.\n     - **Error Handling:**\n       - `_clean_lang()` raises a `ValueError` if the language isn't found, which is acceptable.\n       - `countries_for_language()` assumes the CSV file exists; if not, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError`. No explicit handling is present.\n     - **Security considerations:**\n       - The code reads files based on user input (`lang`). The `_clean_lang()` function attempts to mitigate path traversal by only matching against known language directories.\n       - However, the code does not sanitize the `lang` parameter beyond normalization and matching, which is acceptable here since it only accesses known directories.\n     - **Malicious code or malware risk:**\n       - The code appears safe; it only reads CSV files and returns data.\n       - No execution of external code or suspicious activity.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n\n   - All reports are \"Empty response\" with no details.\n   - No indication of specific vulnerabilities, malware, or code flaws.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n\n   - **Malware Score:** Since there's no evidence of malicious activity (e.g., code injection, external code execution, data exfiltration), the malware score should be **0**.\n   \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques. The score should be **0**.\n   \n   - **Risk Score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of evident vulnerabilities, the overall risk should be **low**—probably **0.1** or **0.2** at most, mainly considering the potential for file-not-found errors or minor issues.\n\n4. **Additional considerations:**\n\n   - The reports lack details, making it difficult to identify specific issues.\n   - No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is relatively safe, with standard practices.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score | Justification                                                  |\n|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score      | 0       | No malicious activity detected.                                  |\n| Obfuscated Score   | 0       | Code is clear and straightforward.                                |\n| Risk Score         | 0.1-0.2 | Minor risks (file not found, input validation), but overall low. |\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are empty; no issues are reported.\n- The code appears secure and free from malware or obfuscation.\n- No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and the lack of reported issues.",
