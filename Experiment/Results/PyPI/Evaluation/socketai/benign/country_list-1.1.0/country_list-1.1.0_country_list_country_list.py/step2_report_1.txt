  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports are marked as \"Empty response\" with no raw response provided. Therefore, there is no detailed information about specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior in the reports. Without explicit reports, I cannot confirm any issues are present in the code.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\nSince the reports contain no content, I cannot identify any logical flaws or errors in their reasoning. The reports do not provide any analysis or findings to evaluate.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue and suggest changes**\n\nNo scores are provided in the reports, only empty responses. Without scores or detailed descriptions, I cannot assess or suggest modifications.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5**\n\nNo risk scores are given, and no issues are described. Therefore, I cannot justify any elevated risk scores.\n\n**Step 5: Pay attention to malware scores**\n\nAgain, no malware scores or descriptions are provided, so I cannot evaluate or justify any malware-related concerns.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\nSince no claims or details are provided, I cannot challenge any assumptions.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure scores are consistent with the report**\n\nNo scores or claims are present, so no consistency checks are possible.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code review:** The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for loading country data per language, with caching and filename sanitization.\n- **Potential security concerns:** Without explicit reports, I see no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** Cannot be assigned without evidence.\n\n### My own estimate (step-by-step reasoning):\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward and not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mostly due to file handling and data access, but nothing critical)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nSince the reports are empty, I cannot identify any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity. The code itself appears clean and safe, with no obvious security flaws.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAwait detailed reports or evidence before assigning higher scores or taking further action.",
