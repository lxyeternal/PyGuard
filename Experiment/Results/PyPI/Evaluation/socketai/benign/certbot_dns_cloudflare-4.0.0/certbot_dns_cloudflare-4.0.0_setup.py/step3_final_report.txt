  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'certbot-dns-cloudflare' Python package, specifying dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' influences dependency inclusion; static strings for dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Conditional inclusion of dependencies based on 'SNAP_BUILD' environment variable; static data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with environment variable controlling dependency inclusion. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The environment variable usage is safe and common. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data occurs. The code is static, readable, and adheres to best practices for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores appropriately set to 0. No modifications are necessary.",
