  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'certbot-dns-cloudflare' plugin, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points for installation and usage.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' for conditional dependency inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; configuration data passed to setup functions and environment variables used for control flow.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' influences which dependencies are installed; no untrusted data flows to security-sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, with dependency management based on environment variables. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package configuration. No external data inputs, network communications, or sensitive data handling are present. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injections. The environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD' controls which dependencies are added, which is a common pattern for conditional builds. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It manages dependencies and package metadata responsibly. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
