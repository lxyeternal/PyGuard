  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard setup.py script for the 'certbot-dns-cloudflare' package.\n- The code uses environment variables ('SNAP_BUILD') to conditionally include dependencies, which is a common pattern.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted data.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs standard package setup tasks. The conditional dependency inclusion based on 'SNAP_BUILD' is straightforward and safe.\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No risky operations or assumptions are made.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Environment variable 'SNAP_BUILD':** Used to control dependencies. This is a standard build-time control, not a security concern.\n- **No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation:** Confirmed by all reports.\n- **No suspicious code patterns:** All reports agree.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The high confidence (1.0) and zero scores for malware/security risk are justified.\n- The scores for obfuscated code should remain at 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The risk score should be 0, given the lack of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and standard.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. All reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always keep an eye on future updates or environment-specific issues, but based on the current code and reports, this supply chain risk is negligible.",
