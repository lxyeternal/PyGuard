{
  "purpose": "The code sets up logging and warning filters for a Python library, ensuring minimal log output and retrieving the package version.",
  "sources": "Reads system warning options, imports version info via importlib.metadata, and sets up logging handlers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code performs configuration tasks only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NullHandler to suppress logs, sets default warnings for the 'sceptre' module if no warning options are set, and retrieves the package version dynamically. It uses standard library modules and patterns typical for library initialization. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute any malicious logic. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup snippet for a Python package, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
