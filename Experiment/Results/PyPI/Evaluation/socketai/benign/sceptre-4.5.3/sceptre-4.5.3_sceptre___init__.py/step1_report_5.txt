  "sources": "Import statements, version retrieval, and warning configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logging handler that discards logs, warnings filtering, and version info retrieval.",
  "flows": "Initialization of logging and warning filters occurs at module load time; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard logging and warning configuration, no secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a NullHandler to suppress logging output, configures warnings to show deprecation warnings for the 'sceptre' module, and retrieves version info. All operations are standard for library setup. No input sources or untrusted data handling is present. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs typical setup tasks for a Python library, including logging suppression and warning configuration, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
