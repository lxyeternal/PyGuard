  "purpose": "Setup logging and warnings configuration for a Python library/module.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version using importlib.metadata.version, accessing sys.warnoptions, and the module's own metadata.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; the code only configures logging and warnings.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; version retrieval and warning filtering are standard operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward library setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a null logging handler to suppress logs, retrieves package version info, and configures warnings for deprecation warnings if no warn options are set. All actions are standard for library setup and contain no malicious intent. No suspicious code patterns or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python library, handling logging and warnings safely without malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
