{
  "purpose": "This module implements a class that colors AWS CloudFormation stack status messages in terminal output for better readability.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings that contain stack status words, specifically via the 'string' parameter in the 'colour' method.",
  "sinks": "The code performs regex matching and substitution within the input string to embed ANSI color codes around known status words.",
  "flows": "The method finds all status words in the input string, then replaces each occurrence with a colored version using regex substitution, embedding ANSI escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses static regex patterns and straightforward string replacement; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of known AWS stack statuses mapped to color codes, compiles a regex pattern to match these statuses, and replaces each occurrence in the input string with a colored version. The process is simple, deterministic, and uses standard libraries. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The only potential concern is that ANSI escape sequences could be misused if input strings are maliciously crafted, but since the code only replaces specific known words, this risk is minimal. Overall, the code is a benign utility for enhancing terminal output readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for coloring AWS stack status messages in terminal output. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the initial reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.",
