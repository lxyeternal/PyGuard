  "purpose": "To add color formatting to AWS CloudFormation stack status messages for better readability.",
  "sources": "Reading input string in the 'colour' method; regex pattern compilation; re.findall to extract statuses.",
  "sinks": "re.sub function replacing stack status strings with colored versions in the input string.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex findall to identify statuses -> re.sub to replace statuses with colored versions -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors; use of standard regex and string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules 're' and 'colorama' to perform regex matching and terminal coloring, respectively. It defines a class with a dictionary mapping known AWS stack statuses to color codes. The regex pattern dynamically matches any of these statuses in a given string. The 'colour' method finds all statuses in the input string, then replaces each occurrence with a colored version. No user input handling beyond string processing, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code solely focuses on enhancing readability of status messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for formatting output, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It relies on standard libraries for string processing and terminal output. No security risks are identified.",
