{
  "purpose": "To add color formatting to AWS CloudFormation stack status strings for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings passed to the 'colour' method; it uses a predefined regex pattern to identify stack statuses.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a colored string with ANSI escape sequences embedded, which could potentially be misused if the input is maliciously crafted to inject escape sequences or control characters.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex finds stack statuses -> replacements insert ANSI codes around statuses -> output string with embedded ANSI codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code uses standard libraries and common regex replacement for coloring. No obfuscated code features or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly defines a dictionary mapping stack statuses to ANSI color codes, compiles a regex to find these statuses, and replaces each occurrence with colored output. The regex pattern is based on joining the statuses, which is standard. The substitution applies ANSI escape codes to the matched statuses, which is typical for terminal coloring. There are no dynamic evaluations, network calls, or hidden functionalities. The code's intent is purely to enhance terminal display readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for string coloring with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It simply applies ANSI color codes to specific patterns in input strings. There are no security risks identified within this code segment.",
