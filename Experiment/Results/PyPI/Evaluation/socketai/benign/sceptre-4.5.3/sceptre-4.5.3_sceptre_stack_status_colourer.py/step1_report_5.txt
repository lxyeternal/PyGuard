{
  "purpose": "To colorize AWS CloudFormation stack status messages within a string for improved readability in terminal output.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'colour' method parameter 'string'. It also reads the class variable 'STACK_STATUS_CODES' for mappings.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 're.sub' function, which replaces matched status words in the input string with colorized versions.",
  "flows": "Input string is scanned for stack status words using 're.findall'. Each found status triggers a substitution in the string to add color codes.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward regex-based replacements; there are no unusual or suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded secrets or external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to add color to specific status words in strings. It uses regex to identify status words and replaces them with colorized versions using 're.sub'. The regex pattern is compiled from a static list of status codes. The process is simple string manipulation without external input/output beyond the input parameter. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of 're' and 'colorama' libraries is standard, and the code does not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for colorizing specific AWS CloudFormation status messages. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
