  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, the stated purpose, and the security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a class that colors AWS CloudFormation stack statuses in terminal output.\n- The code uses standard modules (`re`, `colorama`) and performs straightforward string matching and substitution.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The purpose is purely cosmetic: improving terminal readability.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended, matching status strings and applying ANSI color codes.\n- **Potential security concern:** The only minor point is that inserting ANSI escape sequences could, in theory, be exploited if input strings are maliciously crafted to include escape sequences or control characters. However, since the code only replaces specific known status words, and these are static, the risk is minimal.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Regex pattern:** The pattern `r\"\\b({0})\\b\".format(\"|\".join(STACK_STATUS_CODES))` is correct for matching exact words.\n- **Implementation:** The code performs multiple `re.sub` calls in a loop, which could be optimized by using a single substitution with a callback, but this does not affect security or correctness.\n- **No logical errors:** The logic aligns with the purpose, and the code is straightforward.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is accurate; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0, given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 to 1, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only performs string replacements with known status words and applies ANSI escape sequences, the security risk is negligible.\n- The only theoretical concern is injection of escape sequences if input strings are maliciously crafted. However, because the code only replaces specific known words, and the replacement is controlled, this is unlikely to cause harm.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Injection or malicious behavior:** No. The code does not evaluate or execute input beyond regex matching and substitution.\n- **Supply chain attack potential:** Very low. The code is a utility module with no external dependencies or network activity.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden behaviors:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, considering potential for terminal escape sequence injection, but practically negligible)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward utility for coloring AWS stack statuses in terminal output. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, theoretical risk, but practically safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no supply chain security concerns.",
