  "purpose": "This module colours AWS CloudFormation stack status messages within a string for better visual distinction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input parameter 'string' passed to the 'colour' method.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the modified string with ANSI escape codes embedded, which affects terminal display.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex findall for statuses -> for each status, regex substitution with colour codes -> output coloured string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of 're' for pattern matching is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network connections are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping of stack status strings to terminal color codes, compiles a regex to match these statuses, and then replaces each occurrence with a coloured version using regex substitution. It operates solely on strings and uses standard Python modules. There are no external data sources, network calls, or hidden behaviors. The class's purpose is to enhance terminal output readability. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for colouring AWS stack statuses in terminal output. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs string processing without external dependencies or network activity. Overall, the code appears benign and solely for display purposes.",
