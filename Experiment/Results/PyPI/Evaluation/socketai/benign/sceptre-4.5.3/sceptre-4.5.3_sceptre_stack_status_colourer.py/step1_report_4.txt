{
  "purpose": "To add color formatting to AWS CloudFormation stack status strings for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings passed to the 'colour' method, and uses the internal regex pattern to find stack statuses.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 're.sub' function which replaces detected statuses with color-coded versions in the input string.",
  "flows": "Input string -> 're.findall' to detect statuses -> 're.sub' to replace statuses with colored versions -> output string with colored statuses.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; it does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is present. The color codes are used solely for display formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for coloring AWS stack status messages using regex matching and colorama. It imports standard modules and a common third-party library (colorama). The regex pattern is compiled once for efficiency. The 'colour' method identifies all stack statuses in a given string and applies corresponding color codes. There are no input validation issues, no network activity, and no code injection mechanisms. The code performs simple string manipulation for formatting purposes without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for enhancing terminal output readability. It does not contain malware or security risks. The only notable aspect is its usage of regex for pattern matching, which is safe in this context. Overall, the code is benign with no security concerns.",
