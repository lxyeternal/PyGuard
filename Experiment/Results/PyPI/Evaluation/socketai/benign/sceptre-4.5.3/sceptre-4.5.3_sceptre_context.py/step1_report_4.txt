{
  "purpose": "Define a class for managing and organizing project paths and related configuration data in a Sceptre deployment framework.",
  "sources": "Initial parameter inputs, method return statements, default attribute values, and imported functions (normalise_path, path from os).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or handling of external inputs in a manner that could lead to security risks.",
  "flows": "User input data (via constructor parameters) flows into class attributes, which are then used in methods to construct paths. No external untrusted data is processed in a risky way.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. All code appears to be straightforward configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class with attributes and methods for managing project paths and configurations. It uses safe path joining functions, does not execute or evaluate untrusted data, and contains no code injection, data leakage, or network operations. The use of deepcopy for cloning is safe. The parameters are handled safely without revealing sensitive info. No obfuscated or suspicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation for managing project paths and configuration data in a deployment framework. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
