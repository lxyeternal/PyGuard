  "purpose": "Defines the SceptreContext class to manage project path configurations for the Sceptre tool, including paths and options.",
  "sources": "Path parameters (project_path, command_path, config_path, templates_path), user_variables, options, output_format, no_colour, ignore_dependencies, full_scan.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external output; no network, file writing, or data transmission operations observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization assigns path and configuration parameters; clone creates a deep copy of the context. No untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No use of insecure functions or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles path normalization, concatenation, and object copying for project configuration. It uses standard library functions and custom helpers without any external network or data transmission. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities detected. The class functions serve straightforward configuration management and cloning, with no input validation or external dependency interaction that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration management class for a project setup. It appears benign, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues identified. It is a typical utility class with safe operations.",
