{
  "purpose": "This module implements the SceptreContext class, which manages configuration paths, options, and variables for a Sceptre project.",
  "sources": "Paths from parameters (project_path, command_path), environment via normalise_path, default file names (config.yaml, templates), user_variables, options, and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly write or execute untrusted data; it primarily constructs and manipulates file paths and stores configuration data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> path normalization and storage -> path construction functions (full_config_path, full_command_path, full_templates_path) -> path.join for directory/file paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, no unusual or obfuscated code. The only potentially sensitive parts are path manipulations, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing project paths and configurations, with methods for constructing absolute paths. It uses standard libraries and helper functions for path normalization. No user input is directly executed or transmitted. The structure is straightforward and typical for configuration management, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration helper module with no malicious intent or security risks. It only manages file paths and options relevant to the project setup.",
