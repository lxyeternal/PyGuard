{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for Python's Logger to prefix log messages with a stack name for easier identification and context in logging outputs.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) reads parameters 'logger', 'stack_name', and optional 'extra'. The process method reads 'msg' and 'kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "The process method outputs the modified message via the parent class's process method, which is a standard logging operation; no external data sink is evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (logger, stack_name, extra) flow into the constructor. During logging, 'msg' is combined with 'stack_name' and passed to the parent process method, which then logs the message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard logging practices, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of LoggerAdapter that adds a prefix to each log message indicating the 'stack_name'. The process method modifies the message by prepending the stack name, then calls the superclass's process method. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted inputs that could lead to vulnerabilities. It is a straightforward utility class designed to enhance logging clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for logging, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply augments log messages with contextual information and does not interact with external systems or sensitive data.",
