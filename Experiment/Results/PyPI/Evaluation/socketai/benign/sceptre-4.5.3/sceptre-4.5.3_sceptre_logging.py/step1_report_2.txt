  "purpose": "A wrapper class for Python's Logger to prefix log messages with a specified stack name.",
  "sources": "The constructor receives a logger object, a stack name, and optional extra logging context; the process method uses these to modify log messages.",
  "sinks": "The process method modifies log message strings; no other untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "Logger instance and stack name -> process method modifies message -> logs with prefixed stack name",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a simple logging enhancement purpose.",
  "analysis": "The class StackLoggerAdapter extends LoggerAdapter, intended to prepend a stack name to log messages. It initializes with a logger and a stack name, then overrides the process method to add this prefix. There is no input/output manipulation beyond string concatenation. No external data sources, network communication, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is a standard logging utility with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple logging utility to add context to log messages. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured utility class.",
