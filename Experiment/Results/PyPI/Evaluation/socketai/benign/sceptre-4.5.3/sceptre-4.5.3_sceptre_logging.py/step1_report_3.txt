{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class around Python's Logger that prefixes log messages with a specified stack name.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) method reads 'logger', 'stack_name', and 'extra' arguments; the process method reads 'msg' and 'kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "The process method modifies the log message, which could affect log outputs but does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('logger', 'stack_name', 'extra') flow into the constructor; 'msg' and 'kwargs' flow into the process method and are modified before passing to the superclass.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code simply modifies log messages for clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LoggerAdapter subclass that prefixes log messages with a stack name. It accepts a logger, a stack name, and optional extra context. The process method prepends the stack name to each message, enhancing log clarity. No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data processing are present. The code uses standard logging practices and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It enhances logging clarity without introducing security concerns.",
