  "purpose": "A wrapper class for Python's LoggerAdapter that prefixes log messages with a specified stack name.",
  "sources": "Initialization of logger, input parameter stack_name, method process with msg and kwargs",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted",
  "flows": "Constructor stores stack_name; process method prepends stack_name to message before logging",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious variable usage detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple wrapper class for a logger, intended to prefix messages with a stack name. It initializes with a logger and a string, and modifies messages in the process method. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or other security concerns. The class appears to serve a logging purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for logging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
