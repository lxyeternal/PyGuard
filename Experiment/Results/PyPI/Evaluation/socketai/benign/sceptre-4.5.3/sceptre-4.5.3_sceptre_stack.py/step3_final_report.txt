  "purpose": "This code defines a Stack class for managing AWS CloudFormation stacks, handling configuration, deprecation, and connection setup within the Sceptre framework.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, class constructor inputs, property getters/setters, deprecation aliases",
  "sinks": "AWS API calls via ConnectionManager during deployment, template rendering, and resource management",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class properties; connection_manager may invoke AWS APIs; template property may trigger template processing",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated properties and aliasing for backward compatibility; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; dynamic resolution is standard in IaC tools",
  "analysis": "The code is a configuration and management class for AWS stacks, with standard patterns for deprecation handling and dynamic properties. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of resolvers and deprecated aliases is typical for evolving infrastructure code. Connection management involves AWS API interactions, which are expected and not malicious. No secrets or payloads are embedded. The deprecation handling is for backward compatibility, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate infrastructure management component with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of dynamic resolution and deprecation is standard. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate given the context of AWS API interactions and configuration complexity.",
