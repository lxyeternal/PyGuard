  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate infrastructure management component with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of dynamic resolution and deprecation is standard. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate given the context of AWS API interactions and configuration complexity."
