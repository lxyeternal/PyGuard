The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score of approximately 0.2 is appropriate given the context of AWS API interactions and configuration complexity."

The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external handlers loaded via entry points, which could be exploited if malicious plugins are installed. Overall, the code itself is safe, with a low security risk primarily due to plugin loading, which is a known pattern but not an inherent flaw."
