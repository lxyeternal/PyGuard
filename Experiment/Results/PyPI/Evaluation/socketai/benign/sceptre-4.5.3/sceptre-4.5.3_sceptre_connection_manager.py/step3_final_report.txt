  "purpose": "This code manages AWS sessions and clients, providing retry logic, role assumption, environment variable handling, and thread safety for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (via get_envs_func), AWS credentials from session, input parameters for profile, region, and role.",
  "sinks": "Uses AWS SDK calls to create sessions and clients, which could potentially expose credentials if misused, but no malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> session creation -> role assumption -> client creation -> API calls",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or covert channels detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured AWS SDK wrapper with retry logic, credential masking in logs, role assumption, and thread safety. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The environment variables are handled securely, and the retry logic employs jitter to prevent throttling issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS connection utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Overall, the code is secure and well-implemented.",
