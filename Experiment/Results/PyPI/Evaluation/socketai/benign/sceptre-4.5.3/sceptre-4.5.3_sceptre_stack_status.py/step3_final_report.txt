  "purpose": "Defines static string constants for stack and change set statuses used in cloud infrastructure management.",
  "sources": "Class definitions containing string constants; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static constants without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static declaration with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes serving as enumerations for status strings. It contains no functions, input/output, external calls, or dynamic behavior. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely to standardize status labels. Given its static, declarative nature, there are no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static declaration of status constants with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
