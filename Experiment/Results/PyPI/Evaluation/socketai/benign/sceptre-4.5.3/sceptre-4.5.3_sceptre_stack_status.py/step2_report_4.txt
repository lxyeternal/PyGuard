  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines two classes (`StackStatus` and `StackChangeSetStatus`) with string constants representing various statuses.\n   - There are no functions, dynamic behaviors, external data reads, or writes.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a static enumeration or constants module.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities**:\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No embedded logic, external calls, or data processing.\n   - The code does not handle user input, network operations, or sensitive data.\n\n3. **Assessment of Security Risks**:\n   - The code is straightforward and benign.\n   - No potential vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The purpose appears to be to standardize status string constants for use elsewhere.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity or payload detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — The code does not introduce any security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Any Issues in the Reports?**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and without malicious intent.\n   - The reasoning is consistent across reports.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n6. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:\n   - The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores all as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n7. **Overall Justification**:\n   - Since the code is just static definitions, there is no basis for higher malware or risk scores.\n   - The consistent assessments across reports support the conclusion that this code is harmless.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided. No security concerns are present in this code snippet.",
