  "purpose": "Define classes with constants representing stack and change set statuses for a deployment management system.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing that could lead to leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist as there are no data inputs or processing pipelines.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining constant strings within classes, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes with class attributes that serve as enums for different statuses. It includes only static string definitions and docstrings. There are no input/output operations, no external data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard for defining status constants in a deployment system and shows no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely defines status constants for a deployment management context. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
