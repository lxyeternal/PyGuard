{
  "purpose": "Define classes with string constants representing simplified statuses for stacks and change sets in a cloud infrastructure context.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present, as the code only defines static string constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input-output paths, or untrusted data handling in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation; the code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two classes that define string constants for various statuses. No data input, external connections, or dynamic execution is present. The code appears to serve as a simple enumeration-like structure for status values. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are evident. The code’s structure and content are typical for configuration or status constants.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, straightforward definition of status constants for stack and change set states, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
