  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, consisting solely of class definitions with string constants representing statuses. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, input/output, external data handling, or malicious code. The code is benign and purely declarative.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is static, simple, and has no security issues. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0  \n   \n   These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature. Since there's no obfuscation or malicious activity, scores of zero are justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   The reports all assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security threats.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature. No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's static, declarative nature. No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, static declaration of constants for statuses, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is entirely benign, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
