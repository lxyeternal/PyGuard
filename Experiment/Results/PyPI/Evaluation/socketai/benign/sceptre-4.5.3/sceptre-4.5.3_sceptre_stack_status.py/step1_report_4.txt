{
  "purpose": "Defines simple classes with string constants representing stack and change set statuses for a deployment or cloud infrastructure management system.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present, as there are no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines static string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with class variables assigned fixed string values. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code segments are present. The purpose appears to be to standardize status strings for use elsewhere in a larger codebase. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static definition of status constants for cloud infrastructure management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
