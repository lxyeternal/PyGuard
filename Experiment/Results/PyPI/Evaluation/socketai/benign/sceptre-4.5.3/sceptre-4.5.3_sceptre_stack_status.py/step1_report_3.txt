  "purpose": "Defines simplified status constants for Stack and ChangeSet states in a cloud management context.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only defines class constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted sources; no effect on system or data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists of static class definitions with string constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions containing string constants representing statuses. There are no data inputs, no dynamic execution, no environment variable usage, and no network or file operations. The classes serve as enumerations for statuses, with no embedded logic or suspicious code. The structure is straightforward, and the code is well-formatted. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, harmless set of status constants used for representing stack and changeset statuses. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious payload, or security risks.",
