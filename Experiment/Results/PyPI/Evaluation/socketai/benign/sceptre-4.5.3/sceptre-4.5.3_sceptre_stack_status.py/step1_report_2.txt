  "purpose": "Defines classes for simplified AWS CloudFormation stack and change set statuses.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external calls, or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward definitions of status constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with string constants representing different statuses. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code's structure and content indicate it is a simple module for status representation without any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data structure for status values. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data interactions, and no security risks.",
