  "purpose": "Utility functions for path normalization, logging, masking, AWS response parsing, deprecation warnings, and object representation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, AWS response headers, input parameters for functions, and temporary file content.",
  "sinks": "Temporary files for debug content, attribute access for deprecated properties, and path strings for normalization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters or environment data flow into functions like get_external_stack_name, mask_key, extract_datetime_from_aws_response_headers, and write_debug_file; data flows into sinks such as temporary files, path strings, and attribute accessors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; use of temporary files for debugging is standard but could be misused if debug content is sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions with safe, standard practices. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior observed. Functions handle data safely, with proper error handling and input validation. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The temporary file creation for debugging is common and not inherently malicious. Path normalization and deprecation handling are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured utility code with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature.",
