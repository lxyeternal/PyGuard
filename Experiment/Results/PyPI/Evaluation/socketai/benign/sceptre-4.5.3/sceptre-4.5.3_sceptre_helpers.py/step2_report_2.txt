  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions for handling paths, logging, masking, AWS response parsing, and deprecated property creation. No network, file, or malicious activity. Functions are safe, standard, and well-structured.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code detected. The low security risk reflects the minimal potential for misuse.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar utility functions, safe handling of data, no malicious behaviors, standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (still very low)\n- **Comments:** Consistent with previous, no signs of malicious activity. The slight increase in security risk is reasonable considering the use of temporary files, but still benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions for path normalization, AWS response parsing, deprecation warnings, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** The analysis remains consistent. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions, safe data handling, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** Clear, benign code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Utility functions, safe, no malicious code, standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on a score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature—utility functions with no network, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as unobfuscated.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly varied but all very low (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's benign nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- **Malware (0):** No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscated segments, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** The code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk (0.1–0.2):** Minor potential concerns around temporary file creation (possible data leaks if misused), but overall very low.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (consistent with the reports and code nature)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, well-structured, and standard for utility functions.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk is present.  \n- The current scores are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
