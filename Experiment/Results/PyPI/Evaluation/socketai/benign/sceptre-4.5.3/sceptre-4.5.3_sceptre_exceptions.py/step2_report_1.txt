  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base `SceptreException`. \n   - No functions, data processing, network calls, or external data handling are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, serving as error indicators within the Sceptre deployment framework.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the assessments.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no dynamic or external operations, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior is present.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is straightforward and transparent.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are based on direct examination, not assumptions.\n   - They correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They accurately reflect the benign and structural nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for error handling within the Sceptre deployment framework. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scoring. No further action needed.",
