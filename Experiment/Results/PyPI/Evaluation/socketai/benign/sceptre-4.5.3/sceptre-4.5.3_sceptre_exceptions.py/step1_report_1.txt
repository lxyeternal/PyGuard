  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Sceptre deployment framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; exception classes are for error signaling only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or malicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for various custom exceptions, all inheriting from a base SceptreException. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The docstrings clarify the purpose of each exception. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for defining application-specific exceptions. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution features are present. Overall, the code is benign and purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions used for error handling in a deployment framework. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
