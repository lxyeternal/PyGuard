{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in the Sceptre project.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and their docstrings, mainly static class declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only declares exception classes without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class declarations inheriting from Exception, serving as custom error types with descriptive docstrings. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or external interactions. The structure appears standard and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining exception classes for error handling. It shows no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and typical for a Python project.",
