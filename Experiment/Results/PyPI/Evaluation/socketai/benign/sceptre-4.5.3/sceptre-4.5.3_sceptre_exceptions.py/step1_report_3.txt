  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Sceptre project",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings in the code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward exception class definitions with docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains subclass definitions of the base Exception class with descriptive docstrings. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The classes serve as error indicators for various failure modes in the Sceptre deployment tool. No suspicious or malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident. The structure and content suggest standard error class declarations for improved error handling and debugging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of custom exception classes used for error management within the Sceptre project. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard, safe pattern of defining exceptions with no malicious or obfuscated components.",
