  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Sceptre deployment framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no input or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions inheriting from a base exception, with descriptive docstrings. No dynamic code execution, data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for structured error handling, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code segment.",
