  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Sceptre error handling.",
  "sources": "None (class definitions and docstrings).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or external data input/output).",
  "flows": "None (no execution flow or data flow; purely class definitions).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code only contains exception class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base SceptreException, each representing specific error conditions relevant to the Sceptre tool. There are no function calls, data processing, external inputs, or outputs. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or malicious code segments are present. The code appears to serve as a structured exception framework for error handling, with descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code's structure is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions intended for error handling within the Sceptre application. It contains no malicious code or security risks. The code is benign and does not perform any harmful or malicious actions.",
