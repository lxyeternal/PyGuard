  "review": "Let's review the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is solely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly note the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's content. Given the benign nature, these scores are appropriate. The obfuscated score is also correctly 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a risk score higher than 0.5. The code is purely structural and does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   Since the code contains only class definitions with no malicious behavior, the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the actual content of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk identified.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions used for structured error handling within the Sceptre deployment framework. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendations**:  \nNo changes needed. The current scoring accurately reflects the code's safety and purpose.",
