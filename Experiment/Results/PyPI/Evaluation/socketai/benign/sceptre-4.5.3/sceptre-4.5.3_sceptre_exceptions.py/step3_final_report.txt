{
  "purpose": "Defines a comprehensive set of custom exception classes for error handling within the Sceptre deployment framework, serving as structural error indicators without executing any logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no input sources, data reads, or external data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; purely class declarations with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, with descriptive docstrings, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from a base exception class, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. It is static and purely structural, serving as error indicators. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for error handling, showing no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with its benign purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
