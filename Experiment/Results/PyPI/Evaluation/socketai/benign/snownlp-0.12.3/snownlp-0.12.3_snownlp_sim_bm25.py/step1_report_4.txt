  "purpose": "Implementation of the BM25 ranking algorithm for information retrieval tasks, calculating similarity scores between documents.",
  "sources": "Input: 'docs' parameter in __init__, which is a list of documents; no external data sources are used during execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input documents are processed to compute term frequencies and inverse document frequencies; similarity scores are calculated based on these precomputed values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard BM25 computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a BM25 class for ranking documents based on the BM25 algorithm. It initializes internal data structures for document frequency, term frequency, and inverse document frequency, performing standard calculations. The methods for similarity scores operate on the provided documents and do not interact with external sources or execute untrusted code. No malicious patterns, such as network connections, file manipulations, or hidden behaviors, are present. The implementation appears straightforward, with proper mathematical operations. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard BM25 ranking algorithm without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a typical information retrieval utility with no evident security risks or malware. The overall security risk score is low.",
