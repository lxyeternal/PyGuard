{
  "purpose": "Implementation of BM25 ranking algorithm for information retrieval based on a collection of documents.",
  "sources": "The code reads input documents during initialization and query documents during similarity calculations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network or external system interaction, no sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input documents are processed to compute term frequencies and inverse document frequencies; similarity scores are computed based on these metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code performs standard BM25 calculations without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with a collection of documents, computes term frequencies and IDF scores, and provides methods to calculate similarity scores between a query and stored documents. No data leaks, external communications, or malicious logic are present. All operations are standard mathematical computations for information retrieval. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a straightforward, legitimate implementation of the BM25 algorithm with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
