  "purpose": "Implementation of the BM25 ranking algorithm for information retrieval scoring.",
  "sources": "Input list of documents provided during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; computations are in-memory; no data leaks or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Input documents -> term frequency and document frequency calculations -> IDF computation -> similarity scoring between query and documents.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of BM25. It processes input documents to compute term frequencies, document frequencies, and inverse document frequencies, then calculates similarity scores. No external interactions, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is correct and aligns with typical BM25 algorithms. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of BM25 with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
