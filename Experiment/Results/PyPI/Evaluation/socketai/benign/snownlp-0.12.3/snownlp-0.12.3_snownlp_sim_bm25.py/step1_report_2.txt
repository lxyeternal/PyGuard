{
  "purpose": "Implementing BM25 ranking algorithm for document similarity scoring",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'docs' in constructor, class initialization, and methods accessing instance variables",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations",
  "flows": "Input 'docs' flows through initialization, frequency calculations, IDF computation, and similarity scoring",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; straightforward implementation of BM25",
  "analysis": "The code defines a BM25 class for information retrieval scoring. It initializes document statistics, computes IDF values, and calculates similarity scores between documents. All operations are standard and involve no external system calls, network activity, or suspicious data handling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be a typical implementation of a well-known algorithm with no anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the BM25 ranking algorithm with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs document similarity calculations securely without suspicious activity.",
