  "purpose": "Implementation of the BM25 information retrieval ranking algorithm for scoring document relevance.",
  "sources": "Input documents provided during class instantiation, and input query documents for similarity scoring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code only processes input data for scoring and does not perform network, file, or external system operations.",
  "flows": "Input documents -> Initialization of term frequencies and IDF -> Scoring functions process input queries against stored document data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for BM25 implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a BM25 class with methods to initialize document statistics (term frequency, document frequency, IDF), and compute similarity scores between input queries and stored documents. It uses standard mathematical formulas without any external system calls, network activity, or suspicious behaviors. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the BM25 algorithm for information retrieval. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely for scoring documents based on input data.",
