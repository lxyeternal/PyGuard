  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic evaluation (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, environment variable access, network connections, file operations, and control flow structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, system modifications, or code execution points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input to evaluation functions or network connections; data flow from code reading to execution or transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code patterns, dynamic code evaluation, suspicious variable naming, complex control flow, hardcoded strings, and inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic evaluation, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. Suspicious patterns include eval/exec usage, complex control flow, and hardcoded strings. The code's benign parts are straightforward, with no evidence of data leakage or system sabotage. The suspicion is primarily based on obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a moderate malware score. No concrete malicious actions are confirmed, but the obfuscation justifies a higher security risk. The overall analysis aligns with the scores, with the highest concern centered on Report 1's obfuscation and dynamic evals. Other reports are consistent with benign code, showing no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic evaluation, indicating a moderate likelihood of malicious intent, justifying a malware score of 0.5 and a security risk of 0.6. The other reports are benign, with scores reflecting minimal risk. Continuous runtime monitoring is recommended for suspicious code segments.",
