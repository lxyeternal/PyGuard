  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but no explicit functionality is clear due to the absence of comments or descriptive identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, file reads, or function arguments, but specific source locations are not provided in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment variable manipulations, but no explicit sinks are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env) through processing functions and possibly to sinks (outputs, network), but exact paths cannot be determined without specific code lines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks evident malicious behavior. It utilizes standard Python constructs, with no signs of data leakage, malicious payloads, or suspicious external calls. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected. The absence of clear input/output handling or network activity suggests no malicious intent. Without more context or code segments, no malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities evident.",
