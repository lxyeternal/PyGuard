{
  "purpose": "The code implements a sentiment analysis classifier using Naive Bayes, with functions to train, save, load, and classify text data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files (neg_file, pos_file), loads and saves model files (sentiment.marshal or user-specified), and processes text input for classification.",
  "sinks": "Returns sentiment probabilities, reads and writes model files, and processes text data.",
  "flows": "File data flows from disk into memory during training and model loading; text input flows from user input into classification functions; model data flows from saved files into the classifier during load operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of relative imports may be unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs natural language processing for sentiment classification. It loads data from files, processes text with segmentation and filtering, trains a Naive Bayes classifier, and allows saving/loading models. The functions operate on external files and user input. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious network activity are evident. The code structure is typical for ML pipelines; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present. There are no suspicious code flows or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard sentiment analysis implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behaviors. The code is clean and functions as expected for its purpose.",
