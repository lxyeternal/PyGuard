  "purpose": "A sentiment analysis classifier using Naive Bayes, loading and saving models from external files, processing text input for classification.",
  "sources": "File reads for 'sentiment.marshal', input text for classification and training data from specified files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input text -> handle() -> classifier.classify() -> output; training data from files -> handle() -> classifier.train().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard NLP sentiment analysis pipeline with model persistence. It reads training data and model files, processes text via segmentation and normalization, and performs classification. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or obfuscation is present. External files are used for data and model storage, which could be a security concern if tampered with, but this is typical in ML workflows. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard sentiment analysis tasks without malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to reliance on external files. Overall, it is safe for use.",
