{
  "purpose": "A straightforward Trie data structure for pattern matching and translation.",
  "sources": "Input text processed in translate() and find() methods; key-value pairs inserted via insert().",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed locally within memory.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through translate() to find() and insert() methods; no external data flows or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard, clear, and free of suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic Trie with insert, find, and translate methods. It operates solely on in-memory data, with no external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. All signals point to benign, standard usage of a Trie data structure. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious routines are present. The code does not handle sensitive data insecurely, nor does it perform any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Trie implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's behavior.",
