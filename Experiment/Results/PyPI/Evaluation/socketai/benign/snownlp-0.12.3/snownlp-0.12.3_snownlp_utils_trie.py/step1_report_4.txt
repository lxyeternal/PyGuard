  "purpose": "Implementation of a Trie data structure for string insertion, search, and translation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'text' parameter in 'find' and 'translate' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and returns data based on string traversal; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through 'find' and 'translate', leading to returned or processed data; no external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The Trie implementation appears straightforward without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Trie with methods to insert key-value pairs, find patterns, and translate text using stored patterns. It operates purely on string data without external interactions, network calls, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. The logic is standard and clear, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Trie data structure implementation without malicious intent. It processes strings locally without external side effects or malicious behavior. No security risks are evident.",
