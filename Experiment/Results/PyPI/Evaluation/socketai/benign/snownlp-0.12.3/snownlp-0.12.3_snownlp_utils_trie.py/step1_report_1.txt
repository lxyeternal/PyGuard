{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a Trie data structure for string matching and translation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'text' parameter in 'find' and 'translate' methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that send data to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is processed through 'find' and 'translate' methods; matched values are returned or used to construct output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be a straightforward Trie implementation without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Trie class with methods to insert key-value pairs, find substrings, and translate text based on stored keys. There are no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data exfiltration routines. The implementation seems typical for pattern matching or token replacement. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure is clear and conventional, with no obfuscation, misleading variables, or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a Trie data structure used for string matching and translation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
