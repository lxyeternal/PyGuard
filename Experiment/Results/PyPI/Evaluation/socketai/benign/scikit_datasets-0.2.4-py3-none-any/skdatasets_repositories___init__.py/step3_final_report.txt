{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a dataset repository loader, importing various datasets and providing a fetch interface for retrieving data, with optional modules loaded dynamically.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports and the fetch function parameters (repository, dataset, collection, kwargs).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not perform external communication or data handling beyond dataset fetching.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to fetch() are passed to the respective repository's fetch method; no complex data flows or external data manipulations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple dataset modules, some conditionally with try-except blocks, and provides a fetch function that delegates dataset retrieval. The code is simple, readable, and does not perform any insecure operations. The reports only mention 'Empty response' without details, which do not indicate any malicious activity or vulnerabilities. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears benign, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores should reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe dataset loader with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are incomplete and do not suggest any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
