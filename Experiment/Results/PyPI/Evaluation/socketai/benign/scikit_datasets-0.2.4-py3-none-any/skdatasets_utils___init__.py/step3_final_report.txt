  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, environment variable reads, data processing functions, network/system interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, or file operations; execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) -> processing functions -> network/file sinks or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected; extensive imports are noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard, with no indicators of malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9). The malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious payloads. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting cautiousness due to ambiguous or extensive imports but no evidence of harm.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
