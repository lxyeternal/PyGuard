{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web application, set up logging, and potentially handle user input or server requests.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, HTTP request parameters, or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Database queries, system commands, network requests, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input data is captured from sources, then processed or transformed, and finally used in database queries, system calls, or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code uses standard libraries and practices; however, if any eval or exec calls are present, they would be suspicious, but none are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging and configuration settings, then sets up server routes or handlers. It uses standard modules and follows typical patterns for a web application. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, or hidden backdoors are evident. Without obfuscated code, no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors are apparent. The code appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is standard application setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical web server configuration with no indicators of malware or security issues.",
