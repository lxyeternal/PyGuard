  "purpose": "Utility functions for fetching, extracting, and processing datasets from URLs, including handling compressed files and converting dataframes to scikit-learn datasets.",
  "sources": "URL request in fetch_file() for downloading data; file system access for reading, writing, and deleting files; data extraction from compressed files.",
  "sinks": "File writing in fetch_file(), unzipping/extracting in fetch_compressed(), deleting files via unlink().",
  "flows": "URL data fetched via urlopen() -> stored in local file -> potentially extracted from archive -> returned as Path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual obfuscation detected. Use of standard libraries and scikit-learn utilities appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of dataset fetching utilities, including downloading files over HTTP, saving them locally, extracting compressed archives, and converting pandas DataFrames into scikit-learn Bunch objects. The use of urlopen() is standard for downloading files, with error handling for HTTP errors. File handling involves creating directories, writing data, and deleting files on exceptions, all typical behaviors. No signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or embedded malware are present. The functions are well-structured, with clear data flows and no suspicious code constructs. The overall design appears legitimate and aligned with common data fetching and preprocessing patterns in machine learning pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for dataset management with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected operations for downloading, extracting, and processing datasets securely and transparently.",
