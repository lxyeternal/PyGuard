{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for downloading, extracting, and processing datasets, including handling compressed files and pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "URL fetching via urlopen, file existence checks, reading from pandas DataFrames, and filesystem operations.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded data to local files, extracting archive contents, and returning file or directory paths.",
  "flows": "URL data fetched via urlopen → written to local file → extracted if compressed → data returned as path or DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling for network and file operations is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and practices for dataset management. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate, and data flows are transparent. The network operations are typical for dataset fetching, with no signs of malicious activity. The code is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign dataset utility module with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily associated with network operations, which are standard in such utilities. The existing scores are accurate and justified.",
