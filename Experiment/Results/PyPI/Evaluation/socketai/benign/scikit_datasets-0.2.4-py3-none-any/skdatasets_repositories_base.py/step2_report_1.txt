  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard dataset utility functions with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code uses standard libraries, handles exceptions properly, and does not exhibit malicious patterns. The confidence is high, and the scores seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard data handling, no suspicious code, and typical use of libraries.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) might reflect cautiousness due to URL fetching or file handling, but no actual malicious activity is present. The malware score remains 0.\n- **Justification:** Since no malware or obfuscation is detected, a securityRisk of 0.2 might be slightly overestimating unless considering general risks of network operations. However, given the functions are standard, this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with detailed analysis indicating benign behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature of the code. Malware score remains 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, standard data fetching and processing.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior detected; scores seem justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, emphasizing safe data management.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; scores are accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no indication of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1-0.2) are acceptable given the network operations involved, but these are low and justified.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, considering network and file operations but no actual threat.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard dataset utility module, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nThe scores assigned in the reports are consistent and reasonable.
