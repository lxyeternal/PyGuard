{
  "purpose": "The code implements statistical analysis and visualization tools for comparing machine learning models' performance across datasets, including significance testing and result formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays and pandas DataFrames; accesses method parameters and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include styled DataFrames and formatted tables; no direct data leaks or sensitive info handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into statistical computations, then into styled table generation; no untrusted data is executed or sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow detected. All functions perform standard statistical analysis and styling tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses well-known libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels) to perform statistical tests and generate styled tables for reporting. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, no network communication, and no data exfiltration routines are present. The functions operate on numerical data, perform significance tests, and style the results for display, all consistent with legitimate data analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate statistical analysis and visualization utility without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs standard operations with no signs of malware or security risks.",
