  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes statistical and styling functions operating on numpy arrays and pandas DataFrames.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code uses standard libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels) for statistical tests and styling, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Security assessment:** No malware, no suspicious control flow, no external communication. The code performs legitimate statistical analysis and visualization.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — consistent with the report.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing model evaluation and styling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured statistical utility, with no malicious activity or suspicious behavior. It handles data securely, with no network or file system risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to cautious default), Obfuscated: 0 — aligns with the report.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on model comparison and hypothesis testing, generating styled tables.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is standard for statistical reporting.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Statistical analysis and visualization for model evaluation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, no external communication, no obfuscation. The code is a legitimate utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0 — aligns with the report.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on statistical testing and styling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, external data leaks, or suspicious code detected. The code is standard for data analysis.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** All reports agree that the code performs standard statistical and styling operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent from the reports.\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n  - **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2), possibly reflecting a conservative stance on code that handles statistical analysis and styling, which could be misused if misapplied, but not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The overall security risk is very low, justifying a score around 0.1–0.2 at most, mainly due to the potential misuse of statistical functions if misapplied, but not due to malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — a minimal risk mainly due to the nature of statistical tools that could be misused, but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard statistical analysis and visualization utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, and the existing scores are justified.",
