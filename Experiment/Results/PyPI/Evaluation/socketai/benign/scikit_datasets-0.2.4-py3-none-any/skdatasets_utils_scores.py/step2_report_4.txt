  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs standard statistical analysis and styling, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified, no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as a legitimate data analysis utility with no malicious intent. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's focus on statistical computations and styling without malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified given the code's purpose.\n- **Comments:** The report's confidence is slightly below 1 (0.95), which is reasonable given the detailed analysis. The conclusion that the code is safe and purely for statistical reporting is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is for statistical analysis and visualization, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no security issues detected.\n- **Comments:** The report assigns full confidence (1.0), which aligns with the evidence. The analysis is thorough, and no suspicious activity is identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing legitimate statistical functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — low, justified.\n- **Comments:** The confidence is high (1.0), consistent with the detailed analysis. The report correctly concludes the code is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is identified as standard statistical analysis and visualization, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low, justified.\n- **Comments:** The confidence is high (0.9), which is reasonable. The analysis aligns with the code's functions.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, assigning a score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero but very low, justified by the code's nature as a statistical utility with no external communication or security-sensitive operations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — very low, justified by the absence of external communication, secrets, or suspicious operations.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code's content. The analysis is thorough and accurate, correctly identifying the code as a legitimate, safe statistical utility with no malicious intent.",
