  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Overall Purpose & Functionality:**\n- The code provides statistical analysis tools for comparing models/datasets, including significance testing, ranking, and styled reporting.\n- It uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels).\n- The outputs are styled DataFrames and formatted tables for presentation.\n- No network, file I/O (beyond styling), or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flow detected.\n\n**Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware:**\n- The code performs standard statistical tests (t-tests, non-parametric tests, multiple hypothesis correction).\n- Styling functions are purely for visualization; no malicious commands or system modifications.\n- No code indicates data exfiltration, remote code execution, or sabotage.\n- The functions operate on provided data, with no dynamic code evaluation or external data fetching.\n\n**Potential Risks & Anomalies:**\n- The code is consistent with typical scientific analysis workflows.\n- No anomalies, suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors are present.\n- The styling functions, while complex, are standard for report formatting.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are evident.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0 to 0.2), consistent with the analysis; no external communication or system modification.\n\n**Summary of discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and justified in their low risk scores.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no external threats or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured statistical utility module.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The risk scores in the reports are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided reports' assessments. The code is safe, transparent, and free of malicious behavior.",
