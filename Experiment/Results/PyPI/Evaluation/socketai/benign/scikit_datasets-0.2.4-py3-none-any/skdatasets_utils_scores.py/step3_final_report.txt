{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical analysis, ranking, and hypothesis testing functions for model comparison, including styled table outputs for reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays, statistical test functions, and styling commands; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or external communication; operates solely on provided data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through statistical computations to styled output tables; no external or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed; code is clear and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels) for statistical tests and styling. It performs model comparison and significance testing without any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The styling functions are for presentation purposes only. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious routines are present. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate data analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical utility for model evaluation and reporting, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and security risk (~0.1-0.2) scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
