{
  "purpose": "This code provides statistical analysis functions for ranking and hypothesis testing of models or datasets, including generating styled tables for presentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'scores', 'samples', 'scores', and 'samples'. It also uses imported libraries like numpy, pandas, scipy, and statsmodels to process data and generate statistical results.",
  "sinks": "Generated tables (DataFrames and Styler objects) which display statistical results, including p-values and significance indicators. No data is sent over network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (scores, samples) -> Processing functions (ranking, testing) -> Significance calculations and styling -> Output styled tables for display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears focused on statistical computations and styling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured statistical analysis module, performing rank-based comparisons and hypothesis tests with styling for presentation. It imports external scientific libraries but does not execute or embed malicious commands. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. It handles input data securely and outputs formatted tables with significance markings. No obfuscation or hidden code features are present. The functions are standard and align with typical statistical reporting tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical analysis utility for model evaluation and hypothesis testing. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. Its security risk score is very low, with no suspicious signals or activities identified.",
