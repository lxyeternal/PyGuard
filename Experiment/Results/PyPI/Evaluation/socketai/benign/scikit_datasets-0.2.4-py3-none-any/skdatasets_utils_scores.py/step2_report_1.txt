  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the correctness of the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a statistical analysis and visualization utility for model comparison, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** The report correctly identifies that the code uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels), performs statistical tests, and styles tables. No suspicious control flow, data leaks, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Scores are 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The malware and security risk scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides statistical functions for ranking and hypothesis testing, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** The review correctly notes the absence of external network calls, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets. The code's purpose aligns with standard data analysis tasks.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Scores are 0 for malware and 0.1 for security risk, which seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound, and the low risk scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs statistical analysis and visualization for model evaluation.\n- **Findings:** The review accurately states that the code operates solely on input data, with no network or system modifications. The functions are typical for data analysis.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Scores are 0 for malware and 0 for security risk, which is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides statistical testing and visualization for comparing models.\n- **Findings:** The review notes the absence of external data leaks, network activity, or malicious code. The code uses standard libraries and performs typical statistical operations.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Scores are 0 for malware and 0.1 for security risk, which seem justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code offers statistical analysis and styling functions for model comparison.\n- **Findings:** The review correctly states that the code only processes input data, with no external communication or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Scores are 0 for malware and 0.2 for security risk, which are reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code performs standard statistical functions with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all justified by the absence of external communication, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — The code is purely statistical and visualization; no malicious routines detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** — Slightly above zero, mainly due to the potential for misuse if embedded in a malicious supply chain, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal residual concern in supply chain context, but no real threat)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, legitimate statistical analysis utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The risk scores are appropriately low, and no adjustments are necessary.",
