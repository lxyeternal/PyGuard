{
  "purpose": "This code provides statistical analysis and visualization functions for comparing multiple algorithms' scores, including significance testing and result formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, such as scores, samples, and model/dataset names.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that transmit untrusted data externally, such as network connections, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through computations (e.g., statistical tests, rankings), then into DataFrames and styling functions for display. No external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code mainly performs statistical analysis and styling without suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements statistical tests (t-tests, non-parametric tests) and styling functions for report generation, all of which are standard in data analysis workflows. It does not include external network access, file manipulations, or code that could be malicious. The functions appear to be well-structured and use common libraries for scientific computing. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote control, or hidden backdoors is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical analysis and report formatting utility, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It operates solely on input data to produce styled tables and hypothesis test results. Overall security risk is low.",
