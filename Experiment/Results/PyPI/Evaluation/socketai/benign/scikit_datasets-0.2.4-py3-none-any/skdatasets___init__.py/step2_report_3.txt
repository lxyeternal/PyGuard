  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is minimal, containing only a module docstring and an import statement.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, data flow, or external data handling.\n   - The import is from a local module, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The conclusions align with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very low (0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Risk scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), appropriate for such straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely a module import with no data processing, network activity, or code execution, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, sticking to the evidence that the code is benign.\n   - They correctly interpret the import as standard and not malicious.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code snippet's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the minimal code, the absence of any dynamic or external code execution, and the standard import pattern, the overall security posture is very low risk.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough in their reasoning.\n\n**In conclusion, the code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.**",
