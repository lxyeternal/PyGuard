  "purpose": "Provides Scikit-learn-compatible datasets by importing the fetch function from repositories.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .repositories import fetch",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable: only an import statement, no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module docstring followed by an import statement importing 'fetch' from a local module 'repositories'. There are no data processing, input reading, or output writing operations. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. The import statement is standard and does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, benign module that imports a function to fetch datasets, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
