{
  "purpose": "Minimal module providing datasets compatible with scikit-learn, primarily importing a fetch function from a local repository module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .repositories module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data flow or network activity",
  "flows": "None; static import without runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring and an import statement, indicating a simple utility module. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The import from a local module is standard in package code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets are detected. The minimal nature and lack of external interactions suggest a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
