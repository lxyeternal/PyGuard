  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code performs network requests to fetch dataset ZIP files from a trusted source (PhysioNet).\n- It parses HTML content to find ZIP filenames.\n- It reads 'RECORDS' files and uses wfdb to load signal data.\n- It extracts metadata from comments using regex and literal_eval.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices, with proper error handling.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2), but all are low, consistent with benign data fetching and parsing.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n\n- The code does perform network requests and handles external data, but this is typical for dataset loaders.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n- Regex and literal_eval are used safely, with exception handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No obfuscated or dynamically generated code.\n\n**Assessment of report scores:**\n\n- The reports generally rate malware as 0 and security risk as very low, which is justified.\n- Confidence levels are high (~0.9-0.95), which is reasonable given the thorough reasoning.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured dataset loader for PhysioNet datasets.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal security risk, mostly related to network data fetching, which is expected for such a utility.\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent. The low scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | My Estimate |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1          |\n\nThis concludes the review.",
