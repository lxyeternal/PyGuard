  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured dataset loader for PhysioNet datasets. It exhibits no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), justified by network data fetching but no malicious activity."
