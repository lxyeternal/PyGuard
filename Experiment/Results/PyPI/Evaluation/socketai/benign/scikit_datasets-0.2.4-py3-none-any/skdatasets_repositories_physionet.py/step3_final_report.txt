{
  "purpose": "Fetches and parses PhysioNet datasets by downloading ZIP files, extracting metadata, and loading signal data into pandas DataFrames or numpy arrays.",
  "sources": "Network requests to BASE_URL, HTML content for ZIP filename extraction, ZIP files containing 'RECORDS' files, comments within records for metadata.",
  "sinks": "Local file system for ZIP and record files, data structures in memory (DataFrame, numpy arrays). No untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Network request retrieves HTML -> HTML parsed to find ZIP filename -> ZIP downloaded -> 'RECORDS' file read -> wfdb loads signals -> comments parsed for metadata -> data assembled into DataFrame/arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Regex and literal_eval used safely with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dataset retrieval operations with proper error handling. It uses well-known libraries and techniques, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Data parsing and processing are straightforward, and network interactions are limited to fetching datasets from a trusted source. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured dataset loader for PhysioNet datasets. It exhibits no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), justified by network data fetching but no malicious activity.",
