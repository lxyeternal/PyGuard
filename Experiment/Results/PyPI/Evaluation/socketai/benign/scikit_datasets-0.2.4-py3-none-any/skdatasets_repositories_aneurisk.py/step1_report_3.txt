{
  "purpose": "To fetch and process the AneuRisk dataset for analysis, providing data in structured format.",
  "sources": "Reads from a URL to download a ZIP file, reads from text files 'Patients.txt' and multiple 'Rawdata_FKS_*.txt' files using np.genfromtxt.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted input data into critical system functions. The code primarily reads data files and processes them into numpy structures.",
  "flows": "Downloads ZIP file from URL -> Extracts data from text files -> Loads data into numpy arrays -> Converts to structured array and returns.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or suspicious behaviors such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden functions. The URL and file paths are fixed, and data processing appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a dataset ZIP file from a specified URL, extracts the data, and reads text files containing patient and function data. It constructs structured numpy arrays with detailed dtype descriptions. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network connections beyond the initial download, and no code that writes or exfiltrates data. The processing steps are typical for data loading routines. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dataset loader with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It downloads a dataset, processes files, and structures data without any evident security risks or malware. Overall, it seems safe for use.",
