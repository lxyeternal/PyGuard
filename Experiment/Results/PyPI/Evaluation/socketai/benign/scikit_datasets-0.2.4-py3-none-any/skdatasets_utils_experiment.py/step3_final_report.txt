{
  "purpose": "The code manages machine learning experiments using Sacred, handling datasets, estimators, cross-validation, and result storage without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Data is read from dataset functions or objects; experiment info and models are stored within Sacred's info dictionary; no external untrusted data sources or network inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "Results, scores, and models are stored locally or within Sacred's storage backends; no data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset functions into estimators for training and scoring; results flow into Sacred info for storage; optional model saving is local; no external data flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; code is transparent and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ML experiment framework with clear data flow, no obfuscation, no network activity, and no malicious logic. It stores results locally or in external storage backends like MongoDB, which are used legitimately. No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1) due to external storage options, which are common and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured ML experiment management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
