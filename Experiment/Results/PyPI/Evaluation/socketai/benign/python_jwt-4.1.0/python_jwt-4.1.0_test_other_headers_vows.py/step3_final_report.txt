{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for JWT token generation and verification, focusing on handling of additional headers and error conditions when headers are redefined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the payload, algs, generated_keys, and external JWT functions (generate_jwt, verify_jwt).",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks; data flows within test functions, primarily involving token generation and verification.",
  "flows": "Source data (payload, headers) flows into jwt.generate_jwt, and the resulting token flows into jwt.verify_jwt, with error handling for redefinition cases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; error handling explicitly prevents redefinition of critical headers ('typ', 'alg').",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying JWT header inclusion and error handling for redefinition. It uses controlled test data and external JWT functions. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or insecure data handling are present. The error handling is explicit and appropriate for testing purposes. The code does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. Overall, it is benign and designed solely for validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for JWT header handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with its purpose and implementation.",
