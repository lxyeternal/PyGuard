{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases to verify the behavior of JWT token generation and verification, specifically focusing on handling custom headers.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'payload', 'algs', and 'generated_keys' imported from 'test.common', and input parameters 'alg' and 'key' provided to functions.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'jwt.generate_jwt' and 'jwt.verify_jwt' functions, which may process the token data. No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident, but these functions could potentially involve sensitive operations depending on their implementation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('alg', 'key') flow into 'generate_jwt' calls; the generated token flows into 'verify_jwt'. The tests check for header inclusion and error handling, but no untrusted data appears to influence critical operations directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code redefines header fields ('typ', 'alg') intentionally to test error conditions, which is standard in testing. No malicious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The use of external libraries seems typical for JWT handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up unit tests for JWT token creation and validation, focusing on handling of 'other_headers' parameter. It explicitly tests for error conditions when standard headers are redefined, ensuring the JWT library handles such cases correctly. No evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be well-structured test code designed for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for JWT handling, verifying header inclusion and error conditions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in the code itself. The code appears safe and purposeful for testing JWT behavior.",
