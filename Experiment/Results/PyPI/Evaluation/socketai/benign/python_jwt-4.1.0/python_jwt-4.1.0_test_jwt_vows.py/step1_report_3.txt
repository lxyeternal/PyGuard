  "purpose": "Run the JWT tests by setting up the test specifications from the 'test' module.",
  "sources": "Importing 'jwt_spec' from the 'test' module and calling its 'setup()' method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; the code only calls a setup method.",
  "flows": "Imports jwt_spec, then executes jwt_spec.setup() without involving external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a test specification object from a local 'test' module and executes its setup() method. There are no evident malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious actions. The code appears to be a simple test setup invocation, likely part of a testing framework. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test setup invocation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
