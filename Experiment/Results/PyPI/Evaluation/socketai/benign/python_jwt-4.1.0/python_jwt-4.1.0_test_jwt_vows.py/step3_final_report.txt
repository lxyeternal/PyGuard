  "purpose": "Initialize and set up JWT testing environment by invoking the setup method of jwt_spec.",
  "sources": "Import statement from test module, calling jwt_spec.setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import jwt_spec from test, then execute jwt_spec.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and method call, no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports jwt_spec from a test module and calls its setup() method. It is minimal, with no network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The internal implementation of setup() is unknown, so the assessment assumes benignity based on the snippet. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1). The code appears to be a standard test initialization routine. Given the lack of evidence for malicious activity and the straightforward structure, the overall security risk is negligible. The confidence in this assessment is high, as the code is simple and typical for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup invocation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting a low-risk, non-obfuscated, non-malicious snippet. The actual risk depends on the internal implementation of jwt_spec.setup(), but based solely on this snippet, it is considered safe.",
