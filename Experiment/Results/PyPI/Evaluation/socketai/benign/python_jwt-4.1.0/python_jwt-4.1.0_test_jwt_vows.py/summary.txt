  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup invocation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting a low-risk, non-obfuscated, non-malicious snippet. The actual risk depends on the internal implementation of jwt_spec.setup(), but based solely on this snippet, it is considered safe."
