  "purpose": "Run JWT tests by importing and setting up jwt_spec test suite.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'jwt_spec' from 'test' module and setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only calls setup() method.",
  "flows": "Import of 'jwt_spec' leads to execution of its setup() method, which may contain additional code, but is not visible here.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only import and setup call. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable usage, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a test specification for JWT from a module named 'test' and calls its setup() function. No direct data processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling is visible. Without the implementation of 'jwt_spec.setup()', we cannot determine if it performs malicious actions. However, the snippet itself is standard test setup code with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward test setup for JWT-related tests with no evidence of malicious behavior. There are no suspicious data flows or anomalies in this snippet. However, full assessment depends on the content of 'jwt_spec.setup()'.",
