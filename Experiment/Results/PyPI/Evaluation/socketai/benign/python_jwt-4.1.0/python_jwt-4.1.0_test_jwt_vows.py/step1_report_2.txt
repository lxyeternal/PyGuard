  "purpose": "Run JWT tests using the jwt_spec setup.",
  "sources": "Importing 'jwt_spec' from the 'test' module, then calling jwt_spec.setup().",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "Import of jwt_spec from test, then execution of jwt_spec.setup() with no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only standard test setup invocation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a test specification for JWT from a test module and runs its setup function. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data leaks, external network communication, or code injection. The code appears to be a straightforward test setup invocation. The module 'test' and 'jwt_spec' are standard naming for test code, and the setup call is typical for initializing tests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple test setup invocation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate test initialization code.",
