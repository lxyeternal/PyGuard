{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for JWT validation, manipulating claims and headers to verify error handling and robustness of the verification process.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from generated JWT tokens, specifically from token headers and claims via decoding and manipulation.",
  "sinks": "The verification function jwt.verify_jwt processes the tokens, which could be a sink if it involves external validation or network calls, but in this context, it only processes the token locally.",
  "flows": "Tokens are generated, then decoded and manipulated (claims or headers are removed or altered), then re-encoded and passed to verify_jwt for validation, forming source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; manipulations are deliberate for testing purposes, such as removing claims or headers to test validation errors.",
  "analysis": "The code generates JWTs with specific claims and headers, then intentionally manipulates these parts to test validation error responses. There are no embedded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads. The manipulations are straightforward JSON and base64 operations, typical for testing JWT validation robustness. The verification function is called with these crafted tokens, and expected errors are checked. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose as a testing suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate JWT validation test suite designed to ensure proper error handling for malformed or incomplete tokens. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and intended solely for validation purposes.",
