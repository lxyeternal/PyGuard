  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive JWT testing suite, generating, verifying, and checking claims and headers. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate given the legitimate testing purpose.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard testing framework without malicious intent. No code anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing JWT generation and verification with various configurations. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, considering it's a test suite.\n- **Justification:** The report notes the absence of malicious behavior, network activity, or backdoors. The minor security risk score accounts for the fact that it's test code, which might be misused if exposed publicly, but that’s standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a detailed JWT testing setup with multiple configurations, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — still low, as it's testing code.\n- **Justification:** The extensive use of dynamic callables for keys is standard in test mocks, not malicious. No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on JWT creation and validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given testing context.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code patterns, no external data leaks, network activity, or backdoors. The use of print statements is typical for tests.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a JWT testing suite with various configurations, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, as expected.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent, code obfuscation, or malicious data handling.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is a legitimate JWT testing suite with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero but low, reflecting the testing nature but no real security threat.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** ~0.1 — standard for test code, minimal security risk.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the code's purpose. No evidence suggests malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, comprehensive JWT testing suite with no malware, obfuscation, or security threats. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.",
