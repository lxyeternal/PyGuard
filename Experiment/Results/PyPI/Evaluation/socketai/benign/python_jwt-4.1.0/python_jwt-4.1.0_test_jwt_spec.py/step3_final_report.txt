{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive JWT token generation and verification test suite, designed to validate claims, headers, and cryptographic functions across multiple configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data includes payloads, cryptographic keys (priv_keys, pub_keys), and configuration parameters such as algorithms and token expiration settings.",
  "sinks": "Functions like jwt.generate_jwt, jwt.process_jwt, and jwt.verify_jwt serve as sinks where token creation and verification occur, handling sensitive cryptographic operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from payloads and keys through token generation functions, then to verification functions, with claims and headers extracted and checked for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. Use of callables for keys is standard in testing contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic libraries and testing practices, with clear structure and no signs of malicious intent. No external network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The use of print statements and dynamic key handling are typical for test environments. The code's purpose is legitimate, and its logic is straightforward, leading to low security and malware risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured JWT testing suite with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
