{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (claims, jwt string, keys), environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "The code generates JWTs, performs cryptographic signing, and decodes JWTs. No data is sent over networks or written to files within this code.",
  "flows": "Claims and headers are constructed or parsed, then combined or decoded to produce or verify JWTs, involving cryptographic functions and base64 encoding/decoding.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'urandom' for 'jti' (token ID) generation appears normal; no hardcoded credentials or secret values are present. No suspicious behavior or backdoors are evident. Warnings about deprecation are benign. No obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements JWT generation and verification with standard cryptographic practices, using established libraries ('jwcrypto') and safe methods (base64url encoding). It allows optional skipping of signature verification and supports multiple algorithms. No malicious code, backdoors, or privacy violations are detected. The use of 'urandom' for generating 'jti' is appropriate. The deprecation warning is unrelated to malicious activity. The regex enforces JWT format. All data handling appears standard for JWT operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical implementation of JWT handling without evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. No malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code performs intended cryptographic operations securely, with no suspicious anomalies.",
