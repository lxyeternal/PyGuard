  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the provided details with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard JWT implementation with no suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity, and no malicious logic. The use of 'urandom' for 'jti' is standard cryptographic practice. The deprecation warning suggests outdated dependencies but not malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the analysis.\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard JWT handling with proper validation. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network or data leaks. The support for 'none' algorithm is noted but is a known JWT risk if misused; here, it's documented and optional.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent detected. The low risk score reflects standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard JWT creation and verification. Use of 'urandom' for 'jti' is appropriate. The deprecation warning is noted but not malicious. The support for 'none' algorithm is a known security consideration but not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n\n- **Justification:** No signs of sabotage or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard cryptographic practices, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity. The deprecation warning is benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion: standard JWT functions, proper validation, no suspicious behavior, no backdoors, no network leaks. The 'urandom' for 'jti' is secure. The deprecation warning is a maintenance note, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — slightly lower, but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious language features.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard risks associated with support for 'none' algorithm and deprecated dependencies, but nothing severe.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1-0.2** — minimal, mostly related to known JWT considerations and deprecated warnings.\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk for this code is very low. It appears to be a standard, well-implemented JWT utility library with no malicious or sabotage intent. The low risk scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
