  "conclusion": "The dependency is a standard, well-implemented JWT utility with no malicious or sabotage indicators. The primary concern is the optional support for 'none' algorithm, which should be used cautiously. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low, with no evidence of malware or sabotage."
