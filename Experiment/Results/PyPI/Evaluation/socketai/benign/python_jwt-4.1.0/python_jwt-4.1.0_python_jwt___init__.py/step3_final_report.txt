  "purpose": "Standard functions for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) using jwcrypto, including claim handling, signature creation, and validation.",
  "sources": "Input claims, private key (priv_key), optional headers, and token components (header, claims, signature).",
  "sinks": "JWT string output; during verification, signature validation and claim checks that could lead to errors or security issues if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Claims and headers are assembled during token creation; signature is generated with priv_key; during verification, token is parsed, signature checked, and claims validated against current time and allowed algorithms.",
  "anomalies": "Support for 'none' algorithm allowing unsigned tokens; use of deprecated warnings indicating outdated dependencies; no hardcoded secrets or network activity; straightforward code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT creation and verification using jwcrypto, with proper claim management, signature handling, and validation. The support for 'none' algorithm is documented, which could be a security concern if misused, but is not malicious by itself. Use of urandom for 'jti' is secure. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The deprecation warning indicates outdated dependencies but not malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and known risks. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a standard, well-implemented JWT utility with no malicious or sabotage indicators. The primary concern is the optional support for 'none' algorithm, which should be used cautiously. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low, with no evidence of malware or sabotage.",
