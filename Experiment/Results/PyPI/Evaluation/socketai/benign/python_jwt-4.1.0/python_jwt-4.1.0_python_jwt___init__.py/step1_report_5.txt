{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to generate, verify, and process JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication and authorization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters: 'claims', 'priv_key', 'jwt', and optional headers. External dependencies like 'urandom' for generating JTI and 'datetime' for timestamps are also sources of data.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the return statement that constructs the JWT string, which includes encoded headers, claims, and signatures. Additionally, 'deserialize' and 'add_signature' methods involve cryptographic operations that could be exploited if misused, but are standard for JWT signing.",
  "flows": "Input claims and keys flow into the 'generate_jwt' function where they are used to create a signed token. During verification, the token is split, decoded, and its signature verified, with validation checks on claims and headers. 'process_jwt' decodes tokens without verification, exposing header and claims.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. The use of 'urandom' for JTI is standard but could be used to generate predictable or re-used identifiers if misused externally. Warning about deprecated module use is present but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements JWT creation and verification following standard practices, with proper validation of headers, claims, and signatures. The use of cryptographic library 'jwcrypto' appears correct, with no suspicious manipulations. The generation of 'jti' uses 'urandom', which is a secure source of randomness. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The only potential concern is the use of a deprecated warning, which does not pose security risks but indicates possible maintenance issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, standard for JWT handling, and does not contain malicious behavior or backdoors. It correctly manages cryptographic signing and verification, with proper validation steps. No signs of malware or supply chain sabotage detected.",
