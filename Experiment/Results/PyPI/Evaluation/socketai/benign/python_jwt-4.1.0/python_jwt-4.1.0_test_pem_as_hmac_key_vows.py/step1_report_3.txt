{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and verify JWT tokens using different key configurations and algorithms, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "It reads data from imported modules ('payload', 'rsa_pub_pem', 'rsa_pub_key') and from the generated JWT token during verification.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any external data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or environment variable manipulations. It verifies tokens internally.",
  "flows": "The flow involves generating a JWT token with a key, then verifying it with different keys and algorithm restrictions, with errors captured if verification fails.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The test code appears straightforward. The use of PEM as an HMAC key is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a PEM-formatted key as an HMAC secret, which is unconventional but not inherently malicious. It tests JWT verification with various allowed algorithms and key usage scenarios. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of external libraries and the testing structure appears legitimate. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing suite for JWT token validation scenarios. It does not contain malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The unconventional use of PEM as an HMAC key is noted but not harmful within a test context.",
