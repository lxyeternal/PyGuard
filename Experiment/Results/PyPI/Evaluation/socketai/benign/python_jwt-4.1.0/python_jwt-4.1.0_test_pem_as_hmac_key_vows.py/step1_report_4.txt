{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and verify JWT tokens using PEM and other key formats for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (`test.common`, `test.python_jwt`) and variables such as `payload`, `rsa_pub_pem`, `rsa_pub_key`, and the generated JWT tokens.",
  "sinks": "Verification functions (`jwt.verify_jwt`) act as sinks where token validation occurs. Errors or results are returned and checked, but no data leaks or external data transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "Tokens are generated using `jwt.generate_jwt` with a key (`pem_key`), then verified with `jwt.verify_jwt` using various allowed algorithms and keys, testing both successful and failed verifications.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and consistent with testing JWT verification; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The use of PEM as an HMAC key (`JWK(kty='oct', k=base64url_encode(rsa_pub_pem))`) is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up JWT generation and verification tests, intentionally using PEM-formatted keys for HMAC tokens, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. It verifies tokens with different algorithm restrictions, expecting errors when algorithms are not permitted, indicating correct validation logic. No suspicious functions, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. The code does not perform any external data exfiltration, system modifications, or suspicious network activity. It appears to be a controlled testing script designed to validate JWT behavior under different configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate test suite for JWT validation logic, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It uses unconventional key formats for testing purposes but does not exhibit malicious behavior. Overall security risk is low.",
