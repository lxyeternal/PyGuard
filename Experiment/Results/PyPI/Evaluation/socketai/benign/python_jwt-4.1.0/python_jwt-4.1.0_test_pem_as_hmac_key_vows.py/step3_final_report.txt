{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for JWT token generation and verification, intentionally using PEM-formatted RSA keys as an HMAC key to test edge cases and misconfigurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the imported payload, PEM key data (rsa_pub_pem), and the jwt functions for generating and verifying tokens.",
  "sinks": "Verification functions process tokens; no external data exfiltration or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Tokens are generated with the PEM-based key and then verified under various allowed algorithm constraints, testing acceptance or rejection based on algorithm matching.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional use of PEM-formatted RSA key data as an HMAC secret, which is unusual and potentially insecure outside testing contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign testing script that explores JWT verification behavior with atypical key usage. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of PEM as an HMAC key is unconventional but appears intentional for testing edge cases. Error handling is appropriate, and no suspicious activities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are justified given the context. The potential security concern is the insecure configuration if misused outside testing, but this does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious testing suite designed to evaluate JWT handling with unconventional key material. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The low malware score (0) and low security risk scores (~0.2-0.3) are appropriate, with the higher end reflecting potential misconfiguration risks if used improperly outside a testing environment.",
