  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious JWT testing suite focused on algorithm enforcement. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The inclusion of 'none' is controlled and typical for testing. The low risk score reflects the controlled environment. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified."
