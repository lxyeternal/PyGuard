  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippet is purely a comment with no executable code, data handling, or suspicious activity. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows present.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious activity are present in the provided code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly recognize that the code is just a comment and correctly identify that there is no executable or malicious content.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are consistent with the analysis that the code is just a comment with no security implications.\n   - **Suggestion:** Scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that there is no executable code, no data flow, and no suspicious activity, the overall security risk should be minimal.\n   - The current `securityRisk` scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions beyond the provided code snippet, which is just a comment.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the nature of the code snippet.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- Since the code is only a comment, there is no need for concern about supply chain security or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is harmless, just a placeholder comment.\n- All scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or escalation is necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
