  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'python_jwt' package, facilitating installation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file to include long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data affects system or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Passing long_description to setup() for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behavior. Use of open() without context management is standard in setup scripts but could be improved.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The open() call could be enhanced with a context manager for best practice, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a normal package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
