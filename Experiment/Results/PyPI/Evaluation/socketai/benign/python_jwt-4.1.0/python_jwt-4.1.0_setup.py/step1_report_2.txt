  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'python_jwt' used to generate and verify JSON Web Tokens.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file from the local directory.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. The code primarily reads a file and calls setup(), which is a standard package configuration function.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a simple file read function without error handling, but this is common in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a read() function to load the README.md content, and then calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The dependencies are clearly specified. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for packaging a JWT-related library. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. It is safe to use.",
