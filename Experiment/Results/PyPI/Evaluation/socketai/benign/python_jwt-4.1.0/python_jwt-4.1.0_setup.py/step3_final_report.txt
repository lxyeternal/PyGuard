  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'python_jwt' Python module, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Calls setup() with static metadata; no sinks involving untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads local file and passes static data to setup(); no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without context manager, which is common in setup scripts but not ideal best practice; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static configuration script for packaging a Python project. It does not involve dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The use of open() without a context manager is a minor style issue but not a security concern. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are appropriately very low. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is safe, standard, and free of security issues. It does not contain malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
