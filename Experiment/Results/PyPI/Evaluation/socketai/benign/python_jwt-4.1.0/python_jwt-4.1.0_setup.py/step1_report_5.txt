{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'python_jwt' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows to sinks that could cause security issues; no data leakage or system effects are apparent.",
  "flows": "Data from the 'README.md' file is read and passed to the setup function's 'long_description' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a straightforward read function without validation, but this is standard practice and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a simple function to read a file. The setup() function configures package metadata, dependencies, and other distribution details. No user input handling, environment variable use, or code execution beyond static configuration. The code adheres to typical Python package setup patterns and does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely reads a file and configures package metadata without any harmful actions.",
