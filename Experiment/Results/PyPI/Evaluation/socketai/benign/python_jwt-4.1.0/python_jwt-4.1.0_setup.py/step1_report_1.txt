  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'python_jwt' package, used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, reading package files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system calls are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The read() function reads local files; no flow of untrusted input to critical operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward setup logic with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines a function to read a file, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No external data input or malicious behavior is evident. It primarily manages package metadata and dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads a README file for long description and sets up package metadata.",
