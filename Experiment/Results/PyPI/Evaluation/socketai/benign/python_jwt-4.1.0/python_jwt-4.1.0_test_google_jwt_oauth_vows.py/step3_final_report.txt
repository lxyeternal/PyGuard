  "purpose": "Verify a static Google OAuth JWT token using a test suite to ensure correct JWT parsing and validation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded JWT token string in the variable 'google_jwt_example'.",
  "sinks": "JWT verification function 'jwt.verify_jwt' which processes the token; no external data or output sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Token is passed directly from the 'topic' method to 'jwt.verify_jwt' for validation; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with static token and standard verification calls. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a JWT verification library and test utilities, then verifies a static, documented Google OAuth JWT token in multiple test cases. The token is used solely for testing purposes, with no dynamic input, network activity, or malicious payloads. The verification process employs standard library functions with typical parameters, and the code structure is simple and clear. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test harness verifying a well-known, publicly available JWT token. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
