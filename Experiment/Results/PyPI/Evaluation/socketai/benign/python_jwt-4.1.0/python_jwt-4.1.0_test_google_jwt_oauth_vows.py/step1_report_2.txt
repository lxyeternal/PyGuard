{
  "purpose": "The code tests verification of a Google OAuth JWT token using a provided token example and a jwt library.",
  "sources": "Reads the hardcoded JWT token string (google_jwt_example).",
  "sinks": "Uses jwt.verify_jwt() function to verify token, which may process the token but does not appear to send data externally or execute untrusted code directly.",
  "flows": "The token string flows into jwt.verify_jwt(), which processes and verifies the token; optional verification adjusts clock skew to handle claims.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded JWT token, which is typical for test scenarios but could be misused if misrepresented. No network calls, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious side effects observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports test utilities and a JWT verification library. It verifies a static, hardcoded JWT token representing a Google OAuth token example. Tests include verification failure due to missing claims and relaxed checks that succeed, confirming token parsing and claim validation. No external data input, no data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior detected. The static token is for testing purposes only, not used maliciously. Overall, the code appears to be a benign test script verifying JWT token parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard unit test for verifying JWT tokens with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily processes a hardcoded token to confirm verification logic, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code embedded.",
