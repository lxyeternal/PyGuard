  "purpose": "Test and verify Google OAuth JWT tokens using a sample token and jwt verification functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded JWT token string assigned to 'google_jwt_example'. It imports test functions, JWT verification functions, and date/time utilities.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'jwt.verify_jwt' which processes the JWT token, potentially involving cryptographic verification and claim checks. No untrusted input sources are directly involved in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Source: 'google_jwt_example' (hardcoded token) -> jwt.verify_jwt function call -> verification process; optional claim check adjustments are made with date/time functions.",
  "anomalies": "The JWT token is hardcoded within the test code, which is common for test cases but could be misused if repurposed maliciously. The code verifies JWTs with specified algorithms and optional checks but does not show secret handling or key management. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a test suite verifying a static JWT token issued by Google OAuth. It includes multiple verification attempts, including with relaxed claims checks. The token is hardcoded, which is typical for testing, not an active malicious behavior. The use of jwt.verify_jwt appears standard, with no evidence of code injection, data leaks, or external data handling. No malicious behaviors such as network connections, data theft, or backdoors are present. The code structure and dependencies are typical for testing JWT tokens.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test case for verifying Google OAuth JWT tokens with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The only notable aspect is the use of a hardcoded token, which is acceptable in testing scenarios but should be handled carefully in production. There are no suspicious activities or malware indicators.",
