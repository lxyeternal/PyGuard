{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the package's __init__.py, importing modules and defining the public API for the Airship SDK.",
  "sources": "Static imports from internal modules; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; purely static module setup.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization script, importing classes and functions, setting __all__, and configuring logging. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The assignment of 'Airship' to 'BasicAuthClient' is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, typical SDK package setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain hidden payloads. The scores should reflect this minimal risk.",
