{
  "purpose": "Defines a class to generate various API endpoint URLs based on input parameters such as location and base URL flags.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: location, base_url, oauth_base; class attributes initialized in __init__ based on these parameters.",
  "sinks": "The get() method retrieves URLs based on endpoint attribute names; no external data sources or untrusted input used directly in URL formation.",
  "flows": "Parameters influence URL construction in __init__, then get() retrieves specific URLs by attribute name.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URL patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic present. All URLs are constructed from fixed base URLs and string concatenation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates URL endpoints for API interactions based on input parameters 'location' and 'oauth_base'. The URL selection is straightforward and based on conditional logic. No user input is directly incorporated into URLs in a manner that could lead to injection or malicious redirection. The get() method allows retrieval of URLs by attribute name, with no evident security issue. The code appears to be a standard URL generator with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard URL configuration class without malicious intent. It dynamically constructs URLs based on safe input parameters and provides access via attribute names. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
