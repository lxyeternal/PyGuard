{
  "purpose": "This class constructs various API endpoint URLs based on input parameters such as location and whether OAuth is used, facilitating dynamic URL generation for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'location', 'base_url', and 'oauth_base' provided during class instantiation influence URL construction.",
  "sinks": "The get() method retrieves URLs based on attribute names; no untrusted data is directly used in URL formation beyond initial parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence URL attributes; get() accesses these attributes to return URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External 'base_url' can be set, which is standard but could lead to misuse if maliciously supplied.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward URL generator that assigns URLs based on parameters, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is that 'base_url' can be externally set, which could point to malicious domains if misused, but this is a common pattern for configurable endpoints. The scores in the reports correctly reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, with minor security risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) justified by external configuration potential. Confidence scores are high, indicating reliable assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL construction utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score is justified due to external 'base_url' configuration but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities. All reports' evaluations and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
