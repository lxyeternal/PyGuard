  "purpose": "This code defines a class for constructing URLs based on input parameters for different API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'location', 'base_url', 'oauth_base'; URL construction within the __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "The get() method retrieves URLs based on endpoint names; no untrusted data sinks that lead to data leak or execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence URL assignments; get() retrieves URLs based on attribute names.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; URL construction logic is straightforward and based on parameters. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes a set of URLs based on optional input parameters, choosing different base URLs for 'us' or 'eu' locations and an OAuth flag. URLs are constructed by concatenating base URLs with static endpoint strings. The get() method retrieves URLs based on attribute names. There is no use of untrusted input beyond initial parameters; no data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It appears to be a straightforward URL builder utility with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple URL constructor class with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly constructs URLs based on input parameters and provides a method to retrieve these URLs. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
