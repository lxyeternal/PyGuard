  "purpose": "The class Urls generates various API endpoint URLs based on provided location and base URL parameters for a messaging/notification service.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'location', 'base_url', and 'oauth_base' in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "The get() method retrieves URLs based on endpoint attribute names.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence URL construction; get() accesses class attributes to return URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation; no suspicious URL patterns or data exfiltration code.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs URLs based on optional input parameters, defaulting to specific endpoints for 'us' or 'eu' locations. It systematically builds URL attributes for various API endpoints. The get() method retrieves stored URLs based on endpoint names. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated elements. The logic appears straightforward, solely for URL management, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard URL management utility for an API client, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and functions solely to generate and retrieve endpoint URLs based on configuration parameters.",
