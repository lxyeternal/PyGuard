  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL construction utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score is justified due to external 'base_url' configuration but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities. All reports' evaluations and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
