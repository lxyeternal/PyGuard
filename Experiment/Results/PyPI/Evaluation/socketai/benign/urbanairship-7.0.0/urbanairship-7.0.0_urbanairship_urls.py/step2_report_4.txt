  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** The report correctly states that the code is a straightforward URL generator with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The confidence score is 1, malware score is 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** This aligns well with the code. The code simply constructs URLs based on input parameters, with no user input directly influencing URL content beyond initial parameters, and no dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed. The report is accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of URL construction, no sensitive data, and no malicious behavior. Confidence is 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed. The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** Also concludes the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious URL patterns. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1) are noted, likely due to the fact that 'base_url' can be externally provided, which could theoretically point to malicious domains.\n\n- **Assessment:** This is a reasonable caution. Since 'base_url' is configurable, if an attacker supplies a malicious URL, the code would generate malicious URLs. However, this is a standard behavior for configurable URL builders, and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware score remains 0, which is correct, as no malicious code or payloads are present. Security risk is minimal, reflecting the potential for misconfiguration rather than malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the straightforward, benign nature of the code. Confidence is 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** Recognizes that the code is a URL configuration utility with no signs of malicious behavior. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a security risk of 0.2 are noted, mainly because 'base_url' can be externally set, which could point to malicious domains.\n\n- **Assessment:** This is a fair and cautious assessment. The code's flexibility allows external configuration of 'base_url', which could be exploited if misused, but this is typical for such URL builders.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware remains 0, which is correct. The security risk is slightly higher (0.2) to reflect the potential misconfiguration, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Scores**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, payload, or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent code.\n\n- **Risk score:** The majority assign 0 or 0.2, reflecting that the code itself is benign but could be misused if 'base_url' is maliciously set. This is appropriate.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to the configurable 'base_url' parameter, which could be exploited if set maliciously, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code itself is benign, and the scores across reports are consistent with the logic. The primary concern is the potential misuse of configurable URLs, which is already reflected in the risk score.\n\n**Summary:** No significant changes needed. The current assessments are accurate and justified.",
