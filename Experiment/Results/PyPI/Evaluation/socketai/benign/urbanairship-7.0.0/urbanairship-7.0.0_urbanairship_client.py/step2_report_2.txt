  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code implements API clients with multiple auth methods; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The low security risk aligns with the code's standard pattern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on JWT OAuth flow; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The JWT signing and token exchange are standard. No signs of malicious intent. The slightly higher security risk (0.2) seems reasonable given the complexity but still minimal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard API client with token management; no malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The logic is consistent; no malicious patterns detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Multiple auth methods, standard request handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Well-structured code, no suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** All reports agree on malware=0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate obfuscated=0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** The scores are very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard API client code with proper handling of tokens and secrets, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The code handles sensitive data (keys, tokens, secrets). While no hardcoded secrets are found, the security of the secrets depends on external management.\n- JWT signing uses \"ES384\" with a private key passed as a string. If the private key is improperly handled or exposed, it could be risky, but this is outside the scope of the code itself and depends on implementation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0.0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.0; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly increased to 0.2 if considering token management complexity, but still very low.\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented API client supporting multiple authentication methods.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The low security risk score is justified, but should remain below 0.3 given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**My final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the detailed review.",
