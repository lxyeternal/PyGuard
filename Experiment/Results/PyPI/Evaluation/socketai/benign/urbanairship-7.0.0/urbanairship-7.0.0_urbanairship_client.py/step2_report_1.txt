  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and security implications.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- **Summary**: The code provides API clients with multiple authentication methods; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads.\n  - Uses standard libraries (`requests`, `jwt`) and patterns.\n  - URLs for OAuth are legitimate-looking.\n  - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flow.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Risk: 0.1 (low, given standard implementation)\n- **Conclusion**: Accurate, reasonable, and consistent.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, standard OAuth JWT signing, token refresh, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment**:\n  - JWT claims are standard.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n  - Network endpoints are legitimate.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2 (still low, given the standard OAuth flow)\n- **Conclusion**: Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- **Summary**: Multiple client classes, standard JWT signing, token management, no malicious signs.\n- **Assessment**:\n  - Proper validation, no obfuscation.\n  - No malicious behaviors or backdoors.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n- **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- **Summary**: Multiple clients, standard request flow, no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No hardcoded secrets.\n  - JWT signing appears standard.\n  - No malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n- **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- **Summary**: Standard API clients, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n  - Proper handling of tokens and secrets.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.1\n- **Conclusion**: Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, well-structured API client implementation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code’s content and security posture.\n- The low risk scores reflect the standard nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 to 0.2 (low, due to standard practices and no vulnerabilities observed)\n\n**Note**: Since the code is a client library handling credentials and tokens, the primary concern would be secure handling and transmission. The code adheres to best practices, so no higher risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code appears secure, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The overall security posture is minimal risk.",
