  "purpose": "A client class for interacting with the Airship API, managing authentication, retries, and request handling.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters, configuration attributes, and environment variables during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via requests.Session.request, transmitting credentials and request data.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (credentials, request parameters) flow into network request functions, with headers and body constructed before transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. Use of deprecation warning is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with proper validation of credentials, use of retries with exponential backoff, and detailed logging. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Credentials are handled securely, with validation ensuring correct format. Network requests are made through the requests library, with appropriate error handling and logging. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are detected. The deprecation warning is informational and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It handles credentials securely, performs network requests properly, and includes no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
