  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code consists solely of two enum classes defining static string values for event states.\n   - No dynamic data, input/output, or external dependencies.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears to be a straightforward, safe enumeration definition.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify that the code is static, simple, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - **Note:** The reports do not overstate or understate any potential risks; they correctly conclude no security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `securityRisk` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `confidence` = 1.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic operations, data processing, or network communication.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to it; no justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not include any malicious constructs, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n   \n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No overgeneralizations or unsupported claims are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - The scores align with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of enum classes for event states, with no security issues or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Suggested Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Security Risk     | 0               |\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is benign and well-understood.",
