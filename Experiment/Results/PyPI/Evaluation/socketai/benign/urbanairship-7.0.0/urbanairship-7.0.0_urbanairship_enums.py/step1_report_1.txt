  "purpose": "Define enumerations for live activity and update events.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares enum classes with static string values.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; enums are static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines two enum classes, LiveActivityEvent and LiveUpdateEvent, each with static string members representing different event states. There are no external inputs, dynamic data, or complex logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code appears to be a standard and harmless implementation of enums for event states.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe definition of enumeration classes used for representing event states. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected.",
