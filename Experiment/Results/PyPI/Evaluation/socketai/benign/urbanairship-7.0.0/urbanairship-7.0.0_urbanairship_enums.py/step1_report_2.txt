  "purpose": "Define enumerations for live activity and update events",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; enums are defined statically",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines enums",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward enum definitions with string values",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two enum classes representing event states, with string values indicating event types. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external interactions are present. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe definition of enums with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
