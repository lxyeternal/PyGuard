  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static enum class definitions with string values. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, external data handling, or complex logic. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no anomalies or malicious behavior. Given the code's simplicity, these assessments are accurate. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These scores are consistent with the code's nature. Since the code is static, straightforward, and contains no external interactions, these scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   No report assigns a risk score above 0.0, which is appropriate. The code poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or contain suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code's static nature and harmless purpose.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of enumeration classes for event states. There are no security concerns, malware risks, or obfuscation issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
