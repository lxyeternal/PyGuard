  "purpose": "Define enumerations for live activity and update events.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; hardcoded string values within enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow involving untrusted input; simple enum assignments.",
  "flows": "Enum members are assigned constant string values; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two Enum classes with fixed string values representing event types. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, and no use of environment variables or network operations. The code structure is straightforward, standard Python enum usage. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard for defining event types using enums. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
