  "purpose": "Define enumerations for live activity and update events",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only internal definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurring",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two Enum class definitions with fixed string values. There are no data inputs, no external data processing, and no suspicious behaviors such as data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to serve as simple constants for event types, typical in many applications. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward enumeration definitions serving as constants for event types. It presents no security risks, malware, or suspicious behavior.",
