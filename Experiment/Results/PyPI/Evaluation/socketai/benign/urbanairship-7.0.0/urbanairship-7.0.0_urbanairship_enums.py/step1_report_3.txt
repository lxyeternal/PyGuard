  "purpose": "Define enumerations for live activity and update events",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions, class attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or external output",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum definitions without hidden or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two enum classes with simple string assignments to class attributes. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no use of external libraries beyond the standard enum module. The code appears to be standard and intended for defining constants related to activity events. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of enumeration classes used to define event types. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
