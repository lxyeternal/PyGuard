  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The original code only defines two enum classes with static string values.\n   - No dynamic data, external inputs, or complex logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, static, and safe.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the code or the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code is purely defining constants; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are plausible here.\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions of maliciousness.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The conclusion that the code is harmless and standard is justified.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification**:\nThe code is a minimal, static enumeration definition with no external interactions or complex logic. The reports' assessments are accurate and aligned with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and standard.\n- Scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0",
