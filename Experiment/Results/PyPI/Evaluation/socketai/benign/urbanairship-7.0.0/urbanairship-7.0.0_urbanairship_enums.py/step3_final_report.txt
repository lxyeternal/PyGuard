  "sinks": "None; no data input or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two enum classes with static string values, representing different event states. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, external dependencies, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is a standard, harmless enumeration definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration definition with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
