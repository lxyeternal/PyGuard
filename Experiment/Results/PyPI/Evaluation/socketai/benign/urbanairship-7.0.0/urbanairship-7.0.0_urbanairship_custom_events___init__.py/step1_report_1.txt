  "purpose": "Importing the CustomEvent class or module from the local custom_events package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module or package named custom_events.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies detected. Cannot determine if the imported module is malicious based solely on this line.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a class or object named CustomEvent from a local module custom_events. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks in this snippet. Without additional context or code, it's impossible to evaluate potential malicious behavior or security risks. The import statement itself is standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks by itself. It is a simple import from a local module, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
