  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and the implications for security.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .custom_events import CustomEvent`.\n- No additional code, data flow, or context is provided.\n- The import is from a local module/package, which is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident.\n- The reports consistently conclude benign intent, with confidence levels mostly high (0.8 to 1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence:\n- The code snippet is minimal and only contains an import statement.\n- The import statement is syntactically correct and typical for modular Python code.\n- No actual execution, data handling, or external communication occurs in this line.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reported issues are not present in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify that a single import statement alone cannot be malicious.\n- They acknowledge the lack of context, which prevents definitive security assessment.\n- No flawed reasoning is apparent; the assessments are cautious and appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No logical flaws in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of a simple import.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statement.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly low (0.1 to 0.5), which is reasonable. The only slightly higher score (0.5) in some reports reflects cautiousness due to the import from a local module, but this alone is not risky.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed to scores based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:\n- No report assigns a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate. The import alone does not constitute a security risk.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- Both are consistently 0, which is justified given the minimal code and lack of suspicious features.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- Any claims that the import could be malicious are unfounded without additional context or code.\n- The assumption that the local module could be malicious cannot be validated solely from this line.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code snippet.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\nGiven the minimal code, the absence of suspicious features, and the consistent, cautious reporting, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just due to the fact that the code is part of a larger codebase; potential issues could only arise with malicious content in the module, which cannot be assessed here)\n\n**Summary:** The import statement is benign, and there is no evidence to suggest malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** To thoroughly evaluate security risks, additional context such as the contents of `custom_events.py`, usage patterns, or runtime behavior would be necessary.",
