  "purpose": "Importing the CustomEvent class from a local module named custom_events.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a source of external data or code, specifically from a local module file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line of code, as it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be performed from a single import statement; it merely loads a class from a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no apparent anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a class named CustomEvent from a relative module custom_events. There is no execution, data handling, or network activity evident from this line alone. Without further context, it appears benign, simply part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and benign.",
