  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their validity, scores, and any potential inconsistencies.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal import statement: `from .custom_events import CustomEvent`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no apparent obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data flow.\n- The confidence levels vary but are generally high, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity in the code snippet.\n- Security risks are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the import.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the import as benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The confidence is somewhat low for such a simple import, but acceptable. The security risk score is very low, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states the import is standard and benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** High confidence aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly interprets the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence than Report 2, but still reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct and consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct, consistent with the others.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence, but justified given the minimal context.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code is just an import statement; no malicious code, obfuscation, or data flow exists.\n- **Scores:** All scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- **Malware & obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to zero; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- Given the minimal and benign nature of the code, I would assign the following estimated scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n- These scores reflect the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The reports are accurate and thorough. The import statement is benign, and the scoring appropriately reflects that. No further action or concern is warranted based solely on this code snippet.",
