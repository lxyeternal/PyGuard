  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports concern a single import statement: `from .custom_events import CustomEvent`.\n- No additional code, data flow, or context is provided.\n- All reports conclude that the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating strong certainty that the code is benign based solely on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and assessments:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward import statement.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior can be determined from this line alone.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code snippet.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent; all recognize the minimal, benign nature of the import.\n- No logical flaws are evident; they correctly interpret the import statement as harmless.\n- **Conclusion:** No errors or flaws in reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty based on the minimal code.\n- **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since the code is a simple import with no malicious indicators, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n- The highest confidence is 1, with malware at 0, so the risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware score reflection:**\n- All reports correctly assign malware = 0.\n- No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that an import statement alone cannot be malicious, which is valid.\n- Without additional context, no assumptions about malicious behavior can be made.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores align well with the analysis: benign, no malware, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based solely on this import statement:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given minimal context)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- If this import is part of a larger codebase, the overall security depends on the context, but from this snippet alone, it is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign import statement.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity can be inferred.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe report's assessments are accurate. The code is harmless, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
