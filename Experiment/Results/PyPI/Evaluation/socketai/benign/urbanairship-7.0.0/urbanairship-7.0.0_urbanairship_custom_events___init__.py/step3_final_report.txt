  "purpose": "Import a class or object named CustomEvent from a local module named custom_events.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no input or data reading occurs in this line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module. All reports correctly identify that this line alone is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence levels are high, and malware scores are zero, reflecting the benign nature. The security risk scores are appropriately low, given the minimal and straightforward code. No issues or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores across reports are consistent and justified, with no need for adjustments.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks detected. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
