  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .custom_events import CustomEvent`.\n- The import is from a local module/package, with no data flow, network activity, or input/output handling.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify that this line alone is benign and does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Code presence:** The import statement is present in all reports, matching the original code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence suggests malicious intent; the import is straightforward.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** The minimal nature of the code justifies low risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-Issue Review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.5, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low confidence and risk are appropriate given the minimal code. No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Scores:** confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Assessment:** High confidence is justified, as the import is unambiguous and benign.\n- **Verdict:** Scores appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Assessment:** High confidence; the reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Scores:** confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign with high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Scores appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.8, malware 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence but still justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code, all are appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores consistency:** All are consistent with the analysis.\n- **Potential adjustments:** None necessary; the scores align well with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Security Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** Very low (around 0.1 or less), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports correctly identify that this import statement is benign and pose no security threat. The scoring reflects this appropriately. No changes are needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or slightly below 0.2 to reflect very low risk)\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the evidence and the minimal code snippet provided.",
