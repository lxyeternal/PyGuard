  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided details.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\nThe code is a simple import statement:\n```python\nfrom .custom_events import CustomEvent\n```\nThis line imports a class or object named `CustomEvent` from a local module/package called `custom_events`. There are no data flows, no execution, no network activity, and no apparent anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code\n\n**Issue presence:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code snippet itself is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports\n\n**Observation:**  \nThe reports are consistent in stating that the import is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior. They all correctly note that, based solely on this line, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n\n**Potential flaw in reports:**  \n- The reports could emphasize that, while the import appears benign, the actual `custom_events` module could be malicious if compromised. However, given only this import line, such suspicion cannot be substantiated.\n\n**Summary:**  \nNo significant errors are present in the reports. They are cautious and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue\n\n| Report | Confidence | Obfuscated | Malware | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|----------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0.5          | 0            | 0        | 0.1            |\n| 2       | 1            | 0            | 0        | 0              |\n| 3       | 0.9          | 0            | 0        | 0              |\n| 4       | 1            | 0            | 0        | 0              |\n| 5       | 0.8          | 0            | 0        | 0              |\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n- **Confidence levels:** Vary from 0.5 to 1, which is reasonable given the limited context.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- The `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 1 might be slightly high considering the simplicity of the code. It could be adjusted to 0, as no risk is evident.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5\n\n- Since the code is only an import statement with no malicious indicators, **any risk score above 0.5** is unwarranted.\n- The only exception might be if the imported module is known to be malicious, but such context is absent here.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The risk scores should be **closer to 0** for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Pay attention to malware scores\n\n- All malware scores are zero, which is consistent with the benign code.\n- No evidence suggests malicious behavior, so this is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n\n- The reports assume that because it's an import, there's no malicious activity. This is correct but incomplete if the imported module itself is malicious.\n- Since the report only covers this line, and no further context is provided, the assumption of benignity is valid.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Check score consistency\n\n- The scores are generally consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels reflect the certainty based on the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Overall, the import statement is benign.**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** Should be closer to 0, perhaps 0 or 0.1 at most, considering the minimal code and no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Malware            | 0       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       |\n| Security Risk      | 0       |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present.  \n- The import is standard and local, with no data flow or external communication.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is safe, and the reports are accurate in their assessments. The only minor adjustment is to lower the security risk score from 0.1 to 0, reflecting the benign nature of this minimal import statement.",
