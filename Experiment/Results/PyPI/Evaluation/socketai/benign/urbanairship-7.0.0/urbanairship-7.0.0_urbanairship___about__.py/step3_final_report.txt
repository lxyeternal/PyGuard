  "purpose": "Assigns the version number for the Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version string assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic assignment of a string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, or complex logic are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detected. The code is transparent and standard, with no data flows or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
