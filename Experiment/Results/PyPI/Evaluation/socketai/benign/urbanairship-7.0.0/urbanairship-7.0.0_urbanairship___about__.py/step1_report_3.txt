  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard version assignment statement.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string value '7.0.0' to the variable '__version__'. This is a common practice in Python packages to specify versioning information. There are no data inputs, no external data handling, no suspicious code structures, or potentially malicious operations detected. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version assignment statement with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
