  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior**: All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. This is consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes**: No errors or flaws are identified. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package versioning.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness**:\n   - **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, since the code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n   - **Malware score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity or code is detected or implied.\n   - **Security risk score (0)**: Correct, the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n4. **Risk score justification**:\n   - The reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The malware score is 0, which is justified because there's no malicious activity.\n   - The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report**:\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate for such minimal code.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is a standard version declaration, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence remains at 1, as the analysis is straightforward and conclusive.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Security risk score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is entirely benign and standard practice in Python packaging.",
