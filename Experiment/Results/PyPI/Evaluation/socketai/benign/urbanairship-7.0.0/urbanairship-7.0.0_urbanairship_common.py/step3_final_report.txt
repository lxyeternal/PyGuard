  "purpose": "This code handles API responses, exceptions, and pagination for the Airship service, providing data objects and iteration over paginated results.",
  "sources": "response.json(), response.reason, response.status_code, response.content, self.airship.request()",
  "sinks": "response.json(), response.content, self.airship.request()",
  "flows": "response.json() -> from_response; response.content -> from_response; airship.request() -> _load_page",
  "anomalies": "Use of setattr() for dynamic attribute assignment in from_payload; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API response parsing, error handling, and pagination. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The dynamic attribute setting is typical for flexible data models but could be risky if payloads are malicious. The request method's implementation is not provided, but assuming standard HTTP requests, no malicious activity is inferred. Exception handling and iteration logic are correct. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client component with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (0.2) is justified by the handling of untrusted data and network requests but does not indicate malicious intent.",
