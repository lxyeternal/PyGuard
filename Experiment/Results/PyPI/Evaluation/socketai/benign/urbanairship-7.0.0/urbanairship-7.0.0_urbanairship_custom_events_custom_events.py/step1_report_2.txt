{
  "purpose": "Defines a class to create and send custom events to the Airship API, encapsulating event details and handling API communication.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters and object properties such as name, user, properties, session_id, transaction, value, and occurred.",
  "sinks": "Uses the airship.request method to send data over the network; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to object properties, which are then compiled into a payload and sent via an HTTP POST request to the Airship API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code relies on an external 'airship' object for requests; no unsafe data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a structured event payload with proper property accessors, formats datetime fields correctly, and sends the payload via a method call to an external API client. No suspicious behavior, malicious activities, or security flaws are evident. Usage appears intended and straightforward. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an Airship custom event class, intended to report analytics data securely. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
