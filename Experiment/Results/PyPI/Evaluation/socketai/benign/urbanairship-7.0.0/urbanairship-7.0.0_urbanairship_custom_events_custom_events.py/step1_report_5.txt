{
  "purpose": "Define a class for creating and sending custom events to the Airship API, encapsulating event data and handling the request.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include parameters passed during class instantiation (e.g., name, user, properties, occurred). Data is read from these parameters within property methods and during payload construction.",
  "sinks": "Data is serialized via json.dumps() and sent in an HTTP POST request through the airship.request() method to the specified URL. No direct untrusted data sink vulnerabilities are evident apart from standard API communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through property setters, into internal attributes, then assembled into the payload dictionary (_payload). The payload is serialized and sent via the request method to the API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code properly structures data, and no suspicious behaviors such as network connections to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic are present. No usage of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates event data with proper properties, ensuring data consistency and format (e.g., date formatting). The send() method performs a standard HTTP request to an API endpoint using provided URL and request method. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden network activity, data leaks, or code injection. Usage of external libraries is limited to standard imports, with no dangerous patterns. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward API client implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an API client class for sending custom event data to Airship. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. It appears to serve its intended purpose securely and correctly.",
