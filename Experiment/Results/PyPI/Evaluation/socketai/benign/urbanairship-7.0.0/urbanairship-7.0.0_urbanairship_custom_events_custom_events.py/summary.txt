  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for sending custom events to Airship. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.2) are accurate and appropriate."
