{
  "purpose": "The code defines a CustomEvent class for constructing and sending custom event data to the Airship API, encapsulating event details and user info.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as name, user, interaction_type, interaction_id, properties, session_id, transaction, value, and occurred; the external airship.request() method for network communication.",
  "sinks": "The network request via airship.request() potentially exposes data over the network; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to class properties, assembled into a payload in _payload, serialized with json.dumps(), and sent via airship.request() to the custom_events_url endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present. The code relies on an external trusted airship client.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for event reporting, with proper data encapsulation and formatting. It does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The payload construction and network request are standard. No input validation is performed, but this is typical for such SDK code. The code's purpose is clear, and no security flaws or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for sending custom events to Airship. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.2) are accurate and appropriate.",
