{
  "purpose": "Define a class for creating and sending custom events to Airship analytics system.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__, property setters, self.airship.request method",
  "sinks": "self.airship.request method call, json.dumps with _payload data",
  "flows": "Initialization data flows into class properties, then _payload constructs data for request, which is sent via airship.request",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious data handling, no malicious code injection or obfuscated code. Proper use of data formatting and validation. No unusual network behavior or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for creating custom events with detailed property management, including user info, event details, and optional parameters. The send() method performs an HTTP POST request to the Airship API endpoint with the constructed payload. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code appears to perform standard API communication for analytics purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for sending custom events to Airship's API. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It appears safe for use within its intended purpose.",
