  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__about__.py' via exec(), reading README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "exec() executes contents of '__about__.py' to set version; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a local file for version info, which could be risky if the file is compromised, but is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious code or behavior. The exec() pattern, while potentially risky if the source is malicious, is standard in controlled environments. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature. The primary concern is the exec() pattern, which is acceptable if the source files are trusted. Overall, the code is benign with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe and standard. No malicious activity or obfuscation present. The use of exec() introduces a slight, acceptable risk if the source is trusted. The reports' scores are justified and accurate.",
