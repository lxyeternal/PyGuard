{
  "purpose": "Package 'jenkins' with a C extension 'lookup3' for hash functions.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads static configuration data for package metadata and references an external C source file 'lookup3.c'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the script does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The script loads static configuration data and references an external C source file; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools'; no malicious code or obfuscation detected; external C source 'lookup3.c' is referenced but not provided for inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for packaging a Python module with a C extension. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The use of 'distutils' is outdated but not malicious. The external C source file 'lookup3.c' could pose a risk if malicious, but the script itself does not contain or execute any suspicious code. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the script, with minimal risk associated with external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the external C source file, which cannot be assessed here but should be verified for integrity. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk primarily due to external dependency considerations.",
