  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the external C source file, which cannot be assessed here but should be verified for integrity. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk primarily due to external dependency considerations."
