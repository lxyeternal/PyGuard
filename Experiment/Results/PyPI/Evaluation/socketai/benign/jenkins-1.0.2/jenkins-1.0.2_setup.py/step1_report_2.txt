  "purpose": "Define a Python package 'jenkins' with C extension for hash functions.",
  "sources": "Reading module imports, setup parameters, and file references (lookup3.c).",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that leads to data leakage or malicious action.",
  "flows": "Data flows from module imports and setup parameters to the packaging process, with no untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Uses standard distutils setup, referencing a C extension.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with a C extension. It specifies package metadata and references a local C source file. No user input handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears typical for packaging a Python extension module without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward package setup for a Python project with a C extension. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
