  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package providing a ctypes wrapper around Jenkins hash functions.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata, including package name, version, description, author info, URL, and module files.",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils' which is deprecated but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core' to define package setup parameters, including package metadata and module sources. It specifies a C extension module 'lookup3' built from 'lookup3.c' file. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, nor any suspicious constructs. The code appears straightforward and aligns with standard package setup procedures. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. Usage of deprecated 'distutils' is noted but not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with a C extension, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior.",
