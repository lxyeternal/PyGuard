      "conclusion": "The code is a benign hashing utility relying on an external shared library. No malicious activity is detected. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of 'lookup3.so'. The scores are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a security risk of 0.2 due to dependency trust. Overall, the code is safe, with the primary risk stemming from external library trustworthiness."

The only potential concern is the external C source file, which cannot be assessed here but should be verified for integrity. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk primarily due to external dependency considerations."
