{
  "purpose": "Provides hashing functions by loading an external shared library 'lookup3.so' and invoking its functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input 's' for hashing; loads 'lookup3.so' from the Python library directory.",
  "sinks": "The hash functions return computed hash values; no data leakage or external data transfer observed.",
  "flows": "Input 's' flows into external C functions 'hashlittle' and 'hashlittle2' via ctypes, returning hash results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Reliance on external library trust is noted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around an external C library for hashing. It uses ctypes to load 'lookup3.so' dynamically, passing input data 's' into hashing functions and returning results. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the integrity and trustworthiness of 'lookup3.so', which could be malicious if tampered with. All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, with a slight security risk score (0.2) reflecting dependency trust issues. The code itself is benign, and the external library's trustworthiness should be verified in deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign hashing utility relying on an external shared library. No malicious activity is detected. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of 'lookup3.so'. The scores are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a security risk of 0.2 due to dependency trust. Overall, the code is safe, with the primary risk stemming from external library trustworthiness.",
