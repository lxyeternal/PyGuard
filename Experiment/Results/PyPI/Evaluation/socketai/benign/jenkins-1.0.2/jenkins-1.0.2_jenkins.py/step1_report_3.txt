{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute hash values using an external shared library 'lookup3.so'.",
  "sources": "Reads the file system to locate the shared library and accepts input parameters for hashing functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses external shared library functions which could potentially be exploited if the library is malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code loads a shared library, then calls hashing functions passing in input data and seeds, with data flowing from user inputs to the shared library functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are present. The shared library 'lookup3.so' is dynamically loaded from the filesystem, which could be a risk if the library is malicious or compromised, but this is common for such dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and dynamically loads a shared object 'lookup3.so' from the Python library path. It defines two hashing functions that call into this shared library, passing in data and seed values. No user input handling, no network activity, or system modifications are evident. The code appears straightforward, relying on the external library for hashing functionality. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of 'lookup3.so', which could be malicious if replaced or tampered with, but this is a common dependency pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper around an external hashing library, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident. The primary security concern is the integrity of the shared library, not the code itself.",
