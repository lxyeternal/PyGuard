{
  "purpose": "To import and expose cache-related functions and constants from the oslo_cache.core library for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "The code imports everything (*) from the oslo_cache.core module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks; it only imports and exposes functions/constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet; the import is static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from ... import *' is generally discouraged, but it does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that re-exports specific functions and constants from the oslo_cache.core package. The wildcard import could potentially lead to namespace pollution, but it is a common pattern in some codebases and not inherently malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign re-export module with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The use of 'import *' is a stylistic choice but not suspicious in this context.",
