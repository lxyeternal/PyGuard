  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can cause namespace pollution",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from oslo_cache.core, which is discouraged but not malicious. It then defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. No data flow, user input, or network activity is present. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The main concern is the import style, not security. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The primary issue is the use of 'import *', which is a stylistic concern. The security risk and malware scores should be set to 0, with a low risk score (~0.1) to reflect the minor maintainability concern.",
