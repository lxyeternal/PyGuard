{
  "purpose": "To provide cache configuration and utility functions by re-exporting components from the oslo_cache library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'oslo_cache.core'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink for untrusted data or code execution.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; only import and export of functions/constants.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import from a core library, which can obscure which components are imported and potentially hide malicious or unintended behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from 'oslo_cache.core' via a wildcard import, which is generally discouraged due to readability and security reasons. The rest of the code only defines '__all__' to expose specific symbols. There are no active data flows, input handling, or potentially malicious actions present. The import from an established open-source library suggests intended functionality, not malicious intent. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard re-export module for cache-related functions, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import is a minor concern but not malicious.",
