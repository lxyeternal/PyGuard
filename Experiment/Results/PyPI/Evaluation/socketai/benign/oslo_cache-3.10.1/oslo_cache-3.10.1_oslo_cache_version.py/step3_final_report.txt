  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard version management library and creates a VersionInfo object for 'oslo.cache'. It performs no network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero, with high confidence. The code aligns with common practices in Python packaging and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
