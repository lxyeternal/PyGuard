  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' and reads configuration parameters in 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package setup with static parameters, no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with static parameters 'setup_requires' and 'pbr'. There are no dynamic or untrusted data sources, no code injection, and no suspicious operations. The license headers are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The setup configuration appears legitimate and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
