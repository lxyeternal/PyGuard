{
  "purpose": "A cache proxy that deep copies stored values to prevent modifications after retrieval, primarily used for testing cache behavior and isolation.",
  "sources": "The get() method retrieves data from the cache; the set() method stores data into the cache.",
  "sinks": "The cache backend (self.proxied.get/set) where data is read or written; no external sinks or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from cache storage through get() or set() methods, with deep copying to prevent shared mutable state issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; comments warn about limitations of the in-memory backend but are standard documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a cache proxy that deep copies data on get and set to avoid shared mutable state, especially useful in testing environments. It imports standard modules and contains no malicious or obfuscated logic. The warnings about the in-memory backend are standard and do not indicate security issues. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, and the code aligns with its intended purpose. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects potential misuse outside testing but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities. The malware score is zero, and the code is well-documented and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, testing utility cache proxy with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, clear, and safe for its intended use. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
