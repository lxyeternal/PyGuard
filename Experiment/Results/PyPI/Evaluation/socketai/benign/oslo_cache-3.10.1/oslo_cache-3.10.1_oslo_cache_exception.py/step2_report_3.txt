  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from `Exception`, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no external calls, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code appears to be a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - No logical errors or suspicious reasoning are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is part of a larger application and serves error handling purposes.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence score of 1 across all reports is justified.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No higher scores are justified because there's no malicious activity, vulnerability, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - No suspicious claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the nature of the code.",
