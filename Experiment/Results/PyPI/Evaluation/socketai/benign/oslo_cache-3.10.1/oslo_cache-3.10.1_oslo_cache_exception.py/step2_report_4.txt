  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two simple custom exception class definitions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code is straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, and includes licensing comments.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors are present.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic execution, network activity, or contain hardcoded secrets.\n   - The simplicity and clarity strongly suggest benign intent.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n   - Since the code is purely definitional, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Assessment of Risk & Malware Scores**:\n   - The risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Malware score is 0, correctly reflecting no malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, matching the straightforward code.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They recognize that the code is part of error handling and does not contain any suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores and conclusions are consistent across all reports.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Expert Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, benign Python snippet defining custom exception classes.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and typical for error handling in larger applications.",
