  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two simple exception class definitions with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. They mention the absence of suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Given the simplicity of the code, these assessments are accurate. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is appropriate. Since the code is purely definitional and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, these scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. Given that the code is just class definitions, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions or Suspicious Behavior**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling and contains no suspicious features.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nThe code is standard, minimal, and serves as part of error handling in a larger application. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' conclusions and scores.**",
