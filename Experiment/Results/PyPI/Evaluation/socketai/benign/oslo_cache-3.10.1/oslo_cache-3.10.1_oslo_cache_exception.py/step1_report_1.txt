  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration errors and queue connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output to untrusted destinations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as no input handling or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of two straightforward class definitions inheriting from Exception with no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. It appears to be standard practice for error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or obfuscated code. No external data handling, no secret or hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The code is simple, clear, and aligned with common Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as part of error handling in a larger application. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
