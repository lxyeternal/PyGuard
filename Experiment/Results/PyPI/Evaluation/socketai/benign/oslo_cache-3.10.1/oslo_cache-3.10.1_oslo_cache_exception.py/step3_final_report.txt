{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external calls; purely definitional.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow, no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two simple exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no input/output, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior. It is a standard pattern for custom error handling in Python. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is benign, straightforward, and part of typical application error management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
