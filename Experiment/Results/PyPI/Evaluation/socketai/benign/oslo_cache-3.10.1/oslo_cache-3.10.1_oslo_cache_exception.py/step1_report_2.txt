  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration errors and queue connection issues in a software system.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data, especially untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, contains only exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each with a descriptive docstring. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or external calls. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements are present. The purpose is clearly to define specific error types for a larger application. No anomalies or malicious indicators are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and benign definition of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
