  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration and queue errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output that could leak untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely definitional.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings, used for error handling. It does not include any data input, network activity, or code execution that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase, likely for error handling purposes. Overall, it is a standard, benign Python snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, consisting only of class definitions for exceptions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is standard error class code with no security concerns.",
