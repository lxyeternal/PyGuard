  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration errors and queue connection issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definitions with no execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple custom exception class definitions, each inheriting from Exception. It includes licensing comments but no logic, input/output, or suspicious constructs. There is no evidence of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger application to handle specific error conditions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger codebase to handle specific error cases.",
