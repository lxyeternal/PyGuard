  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration errors and empty queue conditions.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks where untrusted data could cause issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two simple class definitions inheriting from Exception, with docstrings explaining their use. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines two custom exception classes for use elsewhere in the application.",
