  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists solely of two simple class definitions inheriting from `Exception`, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - No input/output, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard practice for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent in the reasoning.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe and part of error handling in a larger application is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all scores are 0, there's no need for justification.\n   - The code shows no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct and justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Systematic Assessment**:\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Final Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, harmless snippet defining custom exceptions, with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring and analysis are accurate and justified.",
