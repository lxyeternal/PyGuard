  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two simple exception class definitions with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains only benign class definitions, there's no reason to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.5 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They focus on the code's actual content and context.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign snippet defining custom exception classes.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nThe code is a typical, harmless part of a larger application, serving error handling purposes. There are no security concerns or malicious indicators.",
