  "purpose": "Configuration options for cache backends in an OpenStack environment, defining cache behavior, backends, secrets, and TLS settings.",
  "sources": "External configuration files, defaults, and environment variables managed via oslo_config.",
  "sinks": "Cache backend modules, secret options (passwords, tokens), TLS certificates, and proxy classes.",
  "flows": "Configuration options are loaded from files or defaults and passed to cache backend modules; secrets are used in connection parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; secret options are properly marked; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration module defining cache options with proper secret handling and no executable logic. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The secret flags are used appropriately, and the code follows best practices for configuration management. The risk is minimal, mainly related to potential misconfiguration, not security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured configuration for cache backends, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scoring is appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
