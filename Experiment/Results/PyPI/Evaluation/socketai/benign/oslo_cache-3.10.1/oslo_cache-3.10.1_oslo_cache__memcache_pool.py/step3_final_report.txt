{
  "purpose": "Provides a thread-safe connection pool for managing memcached client connections, handling creation, destruction, and reuse of connections with timeout management.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters for connection arguments, host URLs, and environment variables for optional modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses connections to memcached servers for data storage/retrieval; no untrusted data sinks or network exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Connection pool acquires connections from the queue, creates new ones if needed, and releases them back; manages connection expiration and host health status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Deprecated support for eventlet is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard connection pooling logic with proper resource management, exception handling, and logging. No malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The use of deprecated modules indicates legacy support but not malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured memcached connection pool with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk score is justified. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern and is safe for use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
