{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Marketo API errors.",
  "sources": "The exception class constructor receives a dictionary 'exc' containing 'message' and 'code'.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method formats and outputs the error message; no untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'exc' dictionary into class attributes, then into string formatting when the exception is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only handles exception data without any suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class with attributes for message and code, initialized from a dictionary. The constructor assigns these values, and the __str__ method formats them for display. There are no external data sources, no dangerous data handling, or suspicious code constructs. The class does not perform any network operations, file access, or secret handling. The structure is standard for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply encapsulates error information for the Marketo API. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
