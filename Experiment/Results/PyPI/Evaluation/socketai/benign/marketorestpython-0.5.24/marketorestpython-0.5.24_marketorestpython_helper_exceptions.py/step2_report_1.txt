  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a straightforward custom exception class.\n- No anomalies, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0 — reasonable.\n- The code is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Notes the use of a mutable default argument (`exc = {'message': None, 'code': None}`), which is a common Python anti-pattern but not malicious.\n- No external data, no network activity, no suspicious logic.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — minor concern about default mutable argument, but not a security threat.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, emphasizes that the class is straightforward.\n- No suspicious code, no external data handling.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the standard pattern, no anomalies or malicious intent.\n- No external data or dangerous behavior.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusion: simple, standard exception class.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard custom exception class.\n- The only minor concern is the use of a mutable default argument in Report 2, which is a common Python anti-pattern but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.1 (from Report 2) is reasonable, but since there's no actual security concern, I would set it at **0** for a more accurate reflection.\n\n### Overall:\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of a custom exception class for API error handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present, and the minor issue with the mutable default argument does not elevate the security risk.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
