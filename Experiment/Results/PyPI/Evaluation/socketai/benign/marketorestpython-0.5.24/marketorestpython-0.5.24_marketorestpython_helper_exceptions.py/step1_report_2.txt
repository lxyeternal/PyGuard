  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Marketo API errors with message and code attributes.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The class uses a mutable default argument in the __init__ method ('exc = {'message':None,'code':None}'), which is a common Python anti-pattern but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with a constructor that initializes 'message' and 'code' from a dictionary. The use of a default dictionary as a default argument could lead to unintended shared state if modified, but does not introduce malicious behavior. The __str__ method formats the exception output clearly. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward exception class definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of a mutable default argument, which is a best practice issue but not malicious.",
