  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms the code is a straightforward custom exception class with no malicious behavior.  \n- No anomalies, no external data handling, no obfuscation.  \n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk score: 0 — justified, as no security issues are identified.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Notes the use of a mutable default argument (`exc = {'message': None, 'code': None}`), which is a known Python anti-pattern but not malicious.  \n- No malicious intent or behavior, just a best-practice concern.  \n- Malware score: 0 — correct.  \n- Security risk: 0.1 — acceptable given the minor issue, but no actual security risk.  \n- The score seems reasonable; no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Highlights that the `__str__` method could potentially expose sensitive data if 'message' or 'code' contain such info.  \n- This is a valid point but not an actual vulnerability unless sensitive data is passed intentionally.  \n- Malware score: 0 — no malware detected.  \n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate, as it's about data exposure, not active threat.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar to others, confirms the class is standard, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- No external data, no malicious code.  \n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk score: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Reiterates the straightforward nature of the class, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- No anomalies or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; it's a simple custom exception class.  \n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0; no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 due to the mutable default argument concern, which is minor and non-malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.  \n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.  \n- The only minor concern (mutable default argument) does not constitute a security risk.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minor best-practice issue, but not a security concern.\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, well-understood, and standard for exception handling.**",
