  "purpose": "Custom exception class for handling Marketo API errors with message and code attributes.",
  "sources": "Initialization with a dictionary parameter ('exc') containing 'message' and 'code'.",
  "sinks": "__str__ method formats and outputs error code and message; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns dictionary values to instance variables; __str__ accesses these variables for string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a mutable default argument ('exc' = {'message': None, 'code': None}), which is a common Python anti-pattern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class with standard initialization and string representation. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The only minor concern is the mutable default argument, which could lead to shared state issues but does not constitute a security risk. The __str__ method simply formats and returns error details. Overall, the code is simple, clear, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a custom exception class for API error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The minor issue with the mutable default argument does not elevate the security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is 0.",
