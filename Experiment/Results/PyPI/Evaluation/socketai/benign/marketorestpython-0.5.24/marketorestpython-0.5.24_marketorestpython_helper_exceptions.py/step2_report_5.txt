  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard custom exception class with no malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or suspicious logic.\n- Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Notes the use of a mutable default argument (`exc = {'message': None, 'code': None}`), which is a known Python anti-pattern but not malicious.\n- No external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.1 is justified due to the mutable default argument, which could lead to subtle bugs but not security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Highlights that the class simply formats error info; potential exposure if 'message' or 'code' contain sensitive data.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to others, straightforward exception class.\n- No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reiterates the simplicity and benign nature.\n- No suspicious logic.\n- Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; remains at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, with one assigning 0.1 due to the mutable default argument. Given that this is a minor best-practice issue and not a security risk, the risk score should stay low, at most 0.1.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed for malware or obfuscated scores.\n- The risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.1 to 0, as the mutable default argument is a best-practice concern but not a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering the default argument issue as minor risk)\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign custom exception class with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
