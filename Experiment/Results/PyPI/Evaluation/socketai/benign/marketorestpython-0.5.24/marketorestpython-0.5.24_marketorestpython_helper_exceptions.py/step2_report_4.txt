  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code provided.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected; the class is straightforward.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, consistent with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Justification:** The class is a standard custom exception with no suspicious activity.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** The report notes the use of a mutable default argument (`exc = {'message': None, 'code': None}`), which is a common Python anti-pattern but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The minor security risk score is acceptable given the mutable default argument, which could lead to unintended shared state but no malicious activity.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No security concerns; the class is a benign utility for error handling.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The implementation is straightforward and safe.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The class is a standard exception class with no malicious intent.  \n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity or code execution present.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** The only slight concern is the mutable default argument in report 2, which is a known Python anti-pattern but not malicious. The assigned securityRisk of 0.1 seems reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard custom exception class, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- No changes are necessary to the scores.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor concern due to mutable default argument, but not security-critical)  \n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
