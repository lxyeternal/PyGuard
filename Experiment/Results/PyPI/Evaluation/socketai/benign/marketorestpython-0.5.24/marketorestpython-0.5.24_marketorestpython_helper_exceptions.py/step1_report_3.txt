  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Marketo API errors.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'exc' dictionary passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in __str__ method, which could potentially expose sensitive data if 'message' or 'code' contain sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'exc' parameter into the object attributes 'message' and 'code', then into the string representation via __str__ method.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward custom exception subclass. It initializes with a dictionary, assigns values to 'message' and 'code', and formats these values into a string when converted to string. There are no external data reads, network activity, or malicious constructs present. The code does not perform any operations beyond setting and displaying error information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a benign utility for error handling in API interactions.",
