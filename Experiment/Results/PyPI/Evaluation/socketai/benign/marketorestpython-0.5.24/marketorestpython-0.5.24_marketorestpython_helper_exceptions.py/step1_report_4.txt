{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to the Marketo API.",
  "sources": "The constructor accepts a dictionary 'exc' with 'message' and 'code' keys, which are used to set instance attributes.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method formats and outputs the error code and message; no untrusted data handling beyond this formatting.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary 'exc' flows into object attributes, then is used in string formatting in __str__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and primarily for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with a dictionary containing 'message' and 'code'. These are stored as attributes and used in the __str__ method for error reporting. There are no external data reads, no network operations, and no suspicious behavior. The code is simple, standard, and does not perform any malicious activity or contain obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a standard custom exception class for API errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
