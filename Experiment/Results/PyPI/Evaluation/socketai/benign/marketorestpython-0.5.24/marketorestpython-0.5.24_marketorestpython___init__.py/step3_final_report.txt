  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points such as eval/exec, network connections, file I/O, environment variables, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, subprocesses, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources like eval/exec or network inputs flow into potentially malicious actions or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs/IPs, unvalidated environment variables, suspicious subprocesses, inconsistent obfuscation indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code contains eval/exec and hardcoded addresses, indicating high malicious potential; other code appears benign with standard patterns. Suspicious behaviors justify high malware and security risk scores. Limited code visibility in some reports leads to cautious low-confidence assessments. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with Report 2 showing significant red flags and others indicating benign code.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 2 exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious intent, justified by high malware and risk scores. The assessments are accurate and consistent with the evidence.",
