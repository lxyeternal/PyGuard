  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'marketorestpython' package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading of standard library modules (os, sys), conditional import of setuptools, and static package data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; setup script primarily for package configuration.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; configuration data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code and instructions, but no malicious or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and performs a standard package setup without executing untrusted code or dynamic code. The comments clarify build instructions but do not contain malicious content. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present. The code is typical for Python package setup scripts, with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be a benign configuration file used for packaging and distribution.",
