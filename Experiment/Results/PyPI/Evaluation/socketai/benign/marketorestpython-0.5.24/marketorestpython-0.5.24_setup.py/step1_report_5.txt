  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'marketorestpython' package to prepare for distribution and upload to PyPI.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os, sys, and conditional import of setuptools.setup; no external input data read; static package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output present; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code solely defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out code related to dependency management; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It performs static imports, conditionally imports 'setuptools.setup', and defines package metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. All operations are standard for a setup script. No external data is read from untrusted sources, and no network or system modification actions are performed beyond package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign setup configuration for packaging a Python module. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
