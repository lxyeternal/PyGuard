  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Python client library for the Marketo REST API.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments, import statements, and package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily reads static configuration and package info.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out code related to dependency management and old upload methods; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, importing modules, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies. The commented lines indicate historical or alternative instructions but do not execute. There are no dynamic imports, external code execution, or user input handling that could introduce malicious behavior. The code avoids dangerous functions or suspicious patterns. The package dependencies are common Python libraries and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and typical for Python package distribution. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present. The script solely handles package metadata and dependencies, with no indications of supply chain attacks or malware.",
