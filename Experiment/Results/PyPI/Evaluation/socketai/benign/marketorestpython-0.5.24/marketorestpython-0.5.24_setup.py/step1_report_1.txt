  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'marketorestpython' package, including metadata, dependencies, and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources; all information is statically defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to cause data leaks, code execution, or other security issues.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the script primarily sets up package configuration without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code that suggests possible dynamic path modification, but it's not active. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup configuration for a Python package, with imports, package metadata, and dependency declarations. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code exists. The commented lines do not contain malicious payloads. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for package setup without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
