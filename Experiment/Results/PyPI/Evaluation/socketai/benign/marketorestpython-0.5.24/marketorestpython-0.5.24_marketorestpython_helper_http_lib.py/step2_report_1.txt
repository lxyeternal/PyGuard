  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and score appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API client with rate limiting, retries, and error handling, with no malicious or suspicious activity observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The code's logic aligns with standard API client practices.\n- The low security risk score seems reasonable.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client features, no malicious intent, and noting some resource management concerns (file handling without explicit closure).\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The resource leak concern (files opened without explicit close) is noted but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard API client features, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent with previous reports.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing standard API wrapper functionality, no malicious activity, resource handling issues (files opened without explicit closure), but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The resource leak concern persists but is not malicious.\n- The overall conclusion remains valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is consistent and comprehensive.\n- No suspicious activity or malware.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Minor resource management concerns (file handling without explicit closure) are noted but do not indicate malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, risk: 0.1–0.2) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- No obfuscation or code hiding techniques present.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2**  \n- Slight resource management concerns but overall low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is a standard API client with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minor resource handling concerns but no real security threat)",
