  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward Python client for Marketo API, with rate limiting, retries, and error handling. No suspicious or malicious activity is identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is low, justified by the absence of malicious activity. The global variable for max_retry_time is benign here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed analysis confirming standard API client behavior. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. Notes resource management issues (open files not closed) but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No malware or obfuscation detected. The resource leak concern is a minor implementation detail, not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical HTTP client with support for GET, POST, DELETE, handling JSON, files, retries, and rate limiting. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No suspicious behavior or malware. The open file handling without explicit closure is noted but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious code or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with rate limiting and retries. No suspicious constructs or malware. The analysis confirms no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, with reasoning that the code is a standard API client with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, citing clear, standard code without obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the use of global variables and resource management concerns, but these are not security threats.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to resource management and global variable usage, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
