{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task, likely involving data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to lack of context and code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data primarily from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could reach potential sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands, especially if there is code executing commands or sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables, parameters) to sinks (network, file, system commands) through intermediate processing functions or variables.",
  "anomalies": "Potential anomalies include use of dynamic execution (exec, eval), hardcoded credentials or tokens, obfuscated code patterns, or unusual control flow. No clear obfuscation or malicious patterns are visible without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward with standard Python constructs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as sending system data over the network, connecting to suspicious domains, or damaging files. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code patterns are detected. The code structure indicates normal functionality, but due to lack of full context and specific content, confidence in the absence of malicious intent is moderate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evident malicious or suspicious activities. However, without the full code, a low confidence level is maintained. No malicious intent or obfuscation is detected.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
