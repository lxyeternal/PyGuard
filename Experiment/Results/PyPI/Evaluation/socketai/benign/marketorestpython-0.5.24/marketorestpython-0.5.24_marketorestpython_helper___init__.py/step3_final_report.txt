  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or external interactions, but no malicious activity or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "sources": "Input sources include sys.argv, environment variables, or network sockets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network transmission, file writes, or subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like sys.argv or environment variables to sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are consistent with the descriptions. Confidence levels are moderate to low due to limited code snippets, but overall assessments are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0. The evaluations across reports are consistent and justified.",
