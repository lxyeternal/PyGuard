  "purpose": "Perform piecewise regression using least squares with optional continuity constraints.",
  "sources": "Input data x and y, splits, degree, and continuous_deriv parameters.",
  "sinks": "np.linalg.solve and np.linalg.lstsq functions, which solve linear systems and least squares problems.",
  "flows": "Data from x, y, and splits are used to form matrices A and S; these are involved in solving linear systems that produce regression coefficients.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to perform standard linear algebra operations for regression analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code implements piecewise polynomial regression with optional continuity constraints by forming and solving a linear system. It uses matrix operations and least squares solutions, which are standard in regression tasks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or malicious behaviors such as network connections, file manipulations, or hidden backdoors are present. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and align with typical numerical methods. All external dependencies are standard numpy functions or imported matrix functions, with no signs of malicious manipulation. The code's purpose is legitimate and standard within statistical modeling contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and performs standard piecewise regression. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It safely computes regression coefficients using linear algebra routines without any suspicious side effects.",
