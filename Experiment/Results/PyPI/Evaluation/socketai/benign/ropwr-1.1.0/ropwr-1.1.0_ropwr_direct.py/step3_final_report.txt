  "purpose": "Implementing piecewise polynomial regression with optional continuity constraints using external matrix construction functions.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays x and y, external functions matrix_A, matrix_S, submatrix_A for matrix generation.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy.linalg.solve and np.linalg.lstsq for solving linear systems; no data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through matrix constructions to linear algebra routines, resulting in regression coefficients.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical regression routines relying on external matrix functions presumed benign. It uses well-known numpy routines for solving linear systems, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or insecure operations. External functions are not provided but are assumed to generate matrices for regression, which is typical. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. The malware score is correctly zero; obfuscation is absent; security risk is minimal. External dependencies should be reviewed separately, but based on this snippet, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of piecewise polynomial regression with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
