  "purpose": "Performs piecewise regression using least squares with options for continuous derivatives and separated bin fits.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays x and y, split points, and external matrices from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data insecurely; solves linear systems directly with numpy.linalg.solve and lstsq.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y) -> matrix computations and linear system solutions -> regression coefficients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. Uses standard numpy functions and imports external modules for matrix creation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard linear algebra for regression modeling. It imports functions from other modules, which are not shown here, but their names suggest matrix construction for regression. It performs matrix assembly and solves linear systems securely using numpy functions. There are no signs of malicious code such as network operations, file manipulations, or hidden backdoors. The use of np.linalg.solve and lstsq is standard for regression computations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of piecewise regression algorithms with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It relies on external modules for matrix creation, which should be reviewed separately for security, but within this code snippet, there are no malicious indicators.",
