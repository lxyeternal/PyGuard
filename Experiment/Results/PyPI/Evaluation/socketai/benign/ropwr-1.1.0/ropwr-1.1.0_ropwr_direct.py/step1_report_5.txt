{
  "purpose": "The code performs piecewise regression using least squares with specified splits and polynomial degree.",
  "sources": "Input data: x (independent variable), y (dependent variable), splits (breakpoints), degree (polynomial degree).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is written or transmitted; no external system calls or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y, splits) used in matrix constructions and least squares solutions within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. No external network calls or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and local modules for matrix calculations. Defines two functions: 'lsq_direct' for a global piecewise polynomial fit with constraints, and 'lsq_direct_separated' for independent fits per segment. Both functions use standard numpy routines and linear algebra for least squares solutions. The code includes data flow from inputs to mathematical operations and outputs. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies observed, such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or system interference. The code appears to implement legitimate statistical modeling routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of piecewise polynomial regression. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. It solely performs mathematical computations for modeling purposes. Therefore, it poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
