  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and exports specific classes and variables for external use.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local module, importing RobustPWRegression from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data output or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; module setup only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and a class from local modules, then declares an export list. There are no user inputs, network interactions, or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initialization and export file with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated code. No security risks detected.",
