  "purpose": "The code is defining module exports for a Python package, including version information and a class named RobustPWRegression.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local _version module and RobustPWRegression from a local base module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and a class from local modules, then defines __all__ for exports. There are no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. It functions as a typical package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
