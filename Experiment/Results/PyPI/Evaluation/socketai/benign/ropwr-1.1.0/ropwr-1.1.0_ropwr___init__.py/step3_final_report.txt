  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py setup for a Python package, importing version info and a class, then defining __all__. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for package initialization files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. Scores of malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
