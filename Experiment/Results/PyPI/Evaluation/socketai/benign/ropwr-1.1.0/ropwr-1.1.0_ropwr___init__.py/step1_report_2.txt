  "purpose": "Define module exports including version information and a class named RobustPWRegression.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing __version__ from a local _version module and RobustPWRegression from a local base module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions; purely defining module exports.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data propagation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific elements from local modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no data inputs, external network interactions, or execution of untrusted code. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module initialization snippet, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
