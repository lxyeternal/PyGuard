  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The original code is just: `__version__ = \"1.1.0\"`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no data flow, no external dependencies, and no suspicious or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a benign, minimal version declaration.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence score is 1 in all cases, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero to `malware` and `securityRisk`, and the code is straightforward, there's no reason to increase these scores.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code only assigns a version string; no malicious activity is evident.\n   - The malware score should remain 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code's benign nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Rationale:\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.**",
