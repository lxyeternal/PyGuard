  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data flows, or output sinks. The code is minimal and typical for version declaration in Python packages. Therefore, **no issues or malicious behavior are present**.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `malware`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree that the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior, **a security risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted**. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThere are no claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions. The assessments are straightforward and based on the code content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent across all reports and appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is entirely benign and standard for version declaration.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security risk or malicious threat.",
