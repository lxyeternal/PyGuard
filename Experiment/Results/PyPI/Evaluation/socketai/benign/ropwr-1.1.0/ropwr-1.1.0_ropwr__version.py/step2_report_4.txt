  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code contains no input/output operations, data flows, external dependencies, or complex logic.\n   - The purpose across all reports is consistent: serve as version metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No issues, anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present in the code snippets.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude benign intent.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Score Reasonableness and Justification**:\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No report suggests or implies any security concern or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential for Adjustment**:\n   - Since the code is as minimal as possible and clearly benign, there is no need to adjust any scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and the reports correctly avoid speculation.\n   - The code is a standard pattern in open-source projects for versioning and poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is a trivial version declaration with no security implications.\n- All scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- Keep the scores at `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
