  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a string value.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None, the code only assigns a version string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static version string to __version__, which is a common practice for Python packages. There are no data inputs, no external calls, and no suspicious logic. The code does not perform any I/O, network, or system modifications. It is straightforward and typical in open-source packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serves only to specify version information, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
