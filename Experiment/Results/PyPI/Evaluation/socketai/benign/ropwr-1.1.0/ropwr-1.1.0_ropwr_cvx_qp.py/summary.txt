  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of quadratic programming for piecewise regression with constraints. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), which are appropriate given the code's functionality."
