{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library called RoPWR, including configuration for installation, requirements, and cleanup commands.",
  "sources": "Reading the version file 'ropwr/_version.py'; potential command execution via os.system() in the CleanCommand class.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call in the CleanCommand class, which executes a shell command for cleaning build artifacts.",
  "flows": "Execution of the run() method in CleanCommand → invokes 'rm -vrf ./build ./dist ./*.pyc ./*.tgz ./*.egg-info' in the shell.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to run shell commands, which could be manipulated if inputs are insecure, but in this context, it is hardcoded and intended for cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup and configuration, with no apparent code for reading external untrusted input during runtime. The only external interaction is reading the version file and executing a shell command via os.system(), which is a controlled command intended for cleaning build artifacts. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of exec() to read the version is typical for setup scripts and does not appear malicious. The overall code structure is standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The only potentially risky part is the os.system() call, but it is a fixed command used for cleanup purposes, not influenced by external input. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
