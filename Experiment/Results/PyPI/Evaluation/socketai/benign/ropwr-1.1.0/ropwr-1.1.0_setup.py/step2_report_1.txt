  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard setup script; reads version via exec() and cleans build artifacts with os.system().  \n- Anomalies: Use of exec() to read version info, which could be risky if the version file is maliciously altered.  \n- Analysis: The code is typical for a setup script. No malicious intent detected. The cleanup command is standard but could be dangerous if the version file is compromised.  \n- Conclusion: No malware or suspicious behavior. Slight risk due to exec(), but common practice.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (reasonable).\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar setup with cleanup command.  \n- Anomalies: Use of os.system() for cleanup, which could be manipulated if inputs are insecure, but in this context, it’s fixed.  \n- Analysis: Standard setup, no external untrusted input during runtime.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious intent. Slight concern about os.system(), but acceptable.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (reasonable).\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Anomalies: Use of os.system() for cleanup.  \n- Analysis: Typical setup script, no suspicious code.  \n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (reasonable).\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Similar setup with a dangerous cleanup command.  \n- Anomalies: The 'rm -vrf' command forcibly deletes files/directories without safeguards.  \n- Analysis: The command is potentially harmful if the script is altered or misused. It’s standard in cleanup commands but can be dangerous if misused.  \n- Conclusion: The only concern is the risky cleanup command, which could delete important files if misused. No malicious code or backdoors detected.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.4 (reasonable given the potential danger).\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Standard setup script with no suspicious activity.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Typical setup, no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: No risks detected.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 (appropriate).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The main concern is the use of `exec()` to read version info, which could be risky if the version file is compromised. However, this is a common pattern.\n- The use of `os.system()` for cleanup commands is typical but could be dangerous if the command string is manipulated or if the script is modified to include malicious commands. Report 4 highlights this as a higher risk due to the destructive nature of the command.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Considering the potential danger of the cleanup command in some reports, a moderate risk score of around **0.3** seems appropriate, reflecting that while the code itself isn't malicious, certain commands could be dangerous if misused or altered.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The malware score remains at 0 because there is no evidence of malicious intent or payload.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is transparent.\n- The security risk is moderate mainly due to the cleanup command, which could be dangerous if the script is modified or compromised.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThese scores reflect that the code is generally safe but contains potentially dangerous commands that should be used with caution.",
