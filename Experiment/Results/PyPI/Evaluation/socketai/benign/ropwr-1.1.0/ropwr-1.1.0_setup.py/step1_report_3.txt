  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ropwr' Python package, facilitating installation, testing, and cleaning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads the version information from 'ropwr/_version.py'.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to remove build artifacts in the 'run' method of the CleanCommand class.",
  "flows": "exec(f.read(), version_info) reads and executes version info; os.system executes a shell command to delete files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for file deletion; potential risk if command is manipulated, but in this context it appears standard and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a setup configuration for packaging. The CleanCommand class uses os.system to remove build files, which is typical in cleanup commands. Reading version info via exec() is common for dynamic versioning but could pose risks if the version file is maliciously altered; however, this is a standard pattern. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code is present. Usage of third-party packages is typical for such scripts and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of os.system for cleanup, but it is contained and typical for such scripts. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
