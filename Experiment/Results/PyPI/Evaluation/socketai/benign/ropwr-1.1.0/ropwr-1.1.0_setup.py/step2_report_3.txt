  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script; uses exec() to read version info, which is common but could be risky if the version file is maliciously altered. The os.system() call for cleanup is intended and appears safe.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, aligns with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, minor concern due to exec() and os.system(), but overall low.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected. The use of exec() is a known pattern but can be risky if the version file is compromised.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on the cleanup command via os.system(). The analysis agrees that the command is fixed and intended for cleanup.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, very low.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious intent, standard setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates similar points: version reading via exec(), cleanup via os.system(). The analysis considers the cleanup command safe because it's fixed and controlled.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, still low.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights the dangerous potential of the `rm -vrf` command in `CleanCommand.run()`. It notes that this command can delete files or directories without safeguards, which could be harmful if the script is modified.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, since no actual malicious code is present, just risky commands.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4, higher due to the destructive nature of the cleanup command, but not malicious per se.\n- **Assessment:** The concern about the command's potential harm is valid, but it doesn't constitute malware or malicious behavior unless manipulated.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Confirms the setup script is standard, with no suspicious code or data flows. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the script is typical.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree there's no malware. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports indicate obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** While some reports mention potential risks associated with the use of `exec()` and `os.system()`, these are standard practices in setup scripts, with no evidence of malicious intent. The only notable concern is the destructive cleanup command, which could be dangerous if the script is altered or misused, but this alone doesn't constitute a malware or malicious activity.\n\n### Final Justified Scores:\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the use of `exec()` and the destructive cleanup command, but overall low and typical for setup scripts.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate setup script for a Python package. The potential risks identified are related to the commands used for cleanup, which are common but could be dangerous if the script is altered. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
