  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ropwr' Python package, which provides mathematical modeling and regression functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'ropwr/_version.py'; reads input files during setup process.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system() to execute a shell command for cleaning build artifacts.",
  "flows": "exec() reads and executes code from '_version.py'; os.system() executes a shell command to remove files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute contents of a version file; os.system() call with 'rm -vrf' for cleaning, which could be dangerous if manipulated, but appears intended for cleanup. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package setup and cleanup tasks. It reads version info dynamically using exec(), which could be risky if the '_version.py' file is maliciously altered, but this is standard practice in setup scripts. The os.system() call for cleaning uses a common removal command; while potentially dangerous if misused, it appears intended for local cleanup during packaging. No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are present, and there are no obfuscated code patterns. All dependencies and metadata seem appropriate for a standard setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent. The use of exec() for version reading is a potential risk if the version file is compromised, but it's standard in setup scripts. The cleanup command uses shell removal commands that are dangerous if misused but are part of normal package maintenance. Overall, no malware or suspicious behavior detected.",
