  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for the 'ropwr' package, handling version reading and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via exec() from 'ropwr/_version.py'; uses os.system() for cleanup in CleanCommand.run().",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes 'rm -vrf' command for cleanup.",
  "flows": "exec() reads version file -> setup() uses version; run() executes cleanup command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version info; execution of a forceful 'rm -vrf' command in cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent. The use of exec() to load version info is common but could be risky if the version file is compromised. The cleanup command employs os.system() to run 'rm -vrf', which is standard but potentially dangerous if the script is modified or misused, as it can delete files irreversibly. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The overall security risk is low but slightly elevated due to the destructive cleanup command. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential danger of the cleanup command.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup file with no malicious behavior detected. The main concern is the destructive 'rm -vrf' command, which should be used cautiously. No evidence of supply chain attack or malicious sabotage is present.",
