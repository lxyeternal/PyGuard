{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the Python library RoPWR, including custom commands and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'ropwr/_version.py' and input files for version extraction.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file write, or system commands that process untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The only system command used is for cleaning build artifacts, which is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures using setuptools, including custom clean command, dependency specifications, and version extraction via exec from a file. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are detected. The use of 'os.system' for cleanup is typical and not malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python library with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It adheres to common practices and does not exhibit suspicious behaviors.",
