  "purpose": "Implementation of a robust piecewise regression model with various fitting strategies, regularizations, and constraints, intended for data modeling and prediction tasks.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for training (x, y), user-specified splits, bounds, and model parameters.",
  "sinks": "Predictions output; internal functions for solving optimization problems; no evidence of data leakage or untrusted external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed, sorted, and passed to optimization functions (lsq_direct, socp, qp, etc.), which generate coefficients. These are then used to predict outputs. No external untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard mathematical and optimization tasks with well-defined functions and parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a regression estimator class with parameter validation, data preprocessing, and optimization-based fitting methods. Validation functions verify parameter types and ranges. The fit method sorts data, checks bounds, and selects appropriate solver strategies based on parameters, calling external optimization routines. Predictions are made via polynomial evaluation, with handling for extrapolation and space transformations. No network, system modification, or data exfiltration code is present. The only external interactions are with numerical optimization routines, which are standard in such models. All functions seem to serve legitimate modeling purposes without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a robust piecewise regression estimator without any malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It relies on standard libraries and external optimization routines to perform its tasks, with no signs of covert data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
