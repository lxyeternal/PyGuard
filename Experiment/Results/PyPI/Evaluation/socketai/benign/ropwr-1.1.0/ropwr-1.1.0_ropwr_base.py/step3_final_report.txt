{
  "purpose": "The code implements a robust piecewise regression model supporting various objectives, regularizations, and constraints, designed for flexible data fitting and prediction.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays 'x' and 'y', which are checked and sorted; internal functions and external solvers used for optimization.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from inputs through validation, sorting, and into optimization routines; no external data leaks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are validated and sorted; parameters are checked; data is passed to optimization routines; fitted coefficients are used for prediction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation observed; routines are standard numerical and validation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard scientific implementation for piecewise regression with extensive parameter validation, solver selection, and prediction logic. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. External solvers are common in optimization routines, and no signs of sabotage or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a robust piecewise regression model with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.1 are justified and appropriate.",
