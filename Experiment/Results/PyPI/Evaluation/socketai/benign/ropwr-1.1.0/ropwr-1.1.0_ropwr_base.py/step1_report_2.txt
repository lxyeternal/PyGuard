  "purpose": "Implement a robust, customizable piecewise regression model with various solver options and constraints.",
  "sources": "Input data from parameters x, y, splits, n_bins, lb, ub; configuration parameters such as objective, regularization, and solver.",
  "sinks": "Polyval functions for polynomial evaluations; no untrusted data sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit() and predict() methods through data checks, sorting, split calculations, and solver-specific coefficient calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of external solvers and numerical computations is standard. No obfuscated code detected. No data exfiltration or malicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for robust piecewise regression with multiple solver options, input validation, and data preprocessing. Validation functions check parameters for correctness but do not contain malicious logic. The fit() method sorts data, computes splits, checks bounds, and calls external solver functions that appear to perform optimization tasks; these functions are imported modules, not defined here, but their use aligns with standard numerical optimization. The predict() method performs polynomial evaluation and extrapolation, also in line with typical regression models. No suspicious data handling, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. No hidden backdoors, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code strictly performs regression analysis with safe numerical routines and validation steps.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a robust piecewise regression model with multiple solver options and input validation. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured scientific computation code without security risks.",
