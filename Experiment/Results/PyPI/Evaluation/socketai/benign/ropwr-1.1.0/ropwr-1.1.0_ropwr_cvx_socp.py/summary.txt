  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of a regression modeling framework based on SOCP. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores (0) are appropriate. The security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code and its purpose."
