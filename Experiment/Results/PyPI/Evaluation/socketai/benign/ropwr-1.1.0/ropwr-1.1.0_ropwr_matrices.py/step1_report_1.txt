  "purpose": "Auxiliary functions to create model matrices for spline or polynomial fitting, including derivatives and difference matrices.",
  "sources": "Input data: x (array of data points), splits (array defining breakpoints), and parameters like order and continuous_deriv.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involving untrusted data handling or network operations. No file or environment variable access or external calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays (x, splits) through mathematical computations to produce matrices (A, D, S, H, etc.) for modeling. No external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard NumPy operations for matrix computations and derivatives, with no obfuscated constructs. Functions are mathematically consistent with spline modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to generate matrices used in spline modeling, including basis matrices (A), derivatives (H, D), and their combinations (A_D, A_H). It handles different orders and continuity conditions. All operations are standard mathematical procedures with no signs of malicious intent. No code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden behavior is evident. The code appears well-structured for numerical computation purposes without external dependencies beyond NumPy. No suspicious loops, external data access, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate auxiliary functions for statistical modeling with no signs of malicious or sabotage intent. It performs standard mathematical operations for spline basis construction. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
