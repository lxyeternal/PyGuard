  "purpose": "Auxiliary functions for cvxpy formulations, including monotonic trend constraints, change point computations, and problem info reporting.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read untrusted input sources or external data. It processes data passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or files, nor does it send data over networks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters (x, y, splits, etc.) through computations within functions; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs standard mathematical operations, array processing, and condition checks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for mathematical and statistical computations related to trend constraints and change points, typical in optimization contexts. It uses numpy for array operations, with no external or potentially malicious data handling. There are no indications of obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious data leaks. The functions are straightforward and focused solely on calculations relevant to cvxpy modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate auxiliary functions for optimization problem formulation, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely performs mathematical computations with no external data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
