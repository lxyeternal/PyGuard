  "purpose": "Auxiliary functions for cvxpy formulations, including trend constraints, change point detection, and problem info reporting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (monotonic_trend, c, D, t, x, y, splits, order, status, size_metrics)",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; computations are internal and purely mathematical",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through numpy operations and logical conditions within functions, producing constraints, change points, and info dictionaries",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard mathematical operations for trend constraints, change point detection, and problem info aggregation. It relies solely on numpy, with no external communication, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The functions are deterministic and align with typical optimization utility implementations. No suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for convex optimization tasks. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
