{
  "purpose": "Provide auxiliary functions for cvxpy optimization formulations, including monotonic trend constraints, change point computation, and problem information retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters: monotonic_trend, c, D, t, x, y, splits, order, status, size_metrics",
  "sinks": "The code processes input parameters and returns boolean or numerical results; no untrusted data is explicitly written or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into mathematical operations and conditional logic, resulting in boolean constraints, index calculations, or info dictionaries; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears straightforward, with standard numpy operations, conditional checks, and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for constraint setup and change point detection within optimization problems. It uses numpy for calculations, with no signs of data leaks, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The functions rely on well-known mathematical operations. There is no hardcoded credential, external communication, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for optimization problem constraints and analysis. No malicious behavior or malware detected.",
