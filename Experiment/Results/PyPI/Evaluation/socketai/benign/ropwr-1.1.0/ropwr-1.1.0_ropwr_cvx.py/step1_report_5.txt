  "purpose": "Auxiliary functions for cvxpy formulations related to trend constraints, change point computation, and problem information reporting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: monotonic_trend, c, D, t, x, y, splits, order, status, size_metrics.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicate untrusted data flows to sensitive operations. Functions perform mathematical computations and return data without side effects or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into calculations for constraints, change point detection, and problem info; results are returned as data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; functions perform standard mathematical and data handling operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mathematical functions for trend constraints, change point detection, and problem info reporting. It relies solely on numpy for computations and does not perform any external I/O, network access, or system modifications. The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and purpose-specific without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard mathematical operations related to convex optimization modeling, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for its intended purpose.",
