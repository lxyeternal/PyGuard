  "purpose": "Auxiliary functions for cvxpy formulations related to monotonic trend constraints, change point computation, and problem information retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through parameters in functions: 'monotonic_trend_constraints' reads 'monotonic_trend', 'c', 'D', 't'; 'compute_change_point' reads 'x', 'y', 'splits', 'order', 'monotonic_trend'; 'problem_info' reads 'status', 'size_metrics'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical operations and returns data structures, with no apparent untrusted data sinks such as network access, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The functions process inputs and produce outputs without interacting with external systems or untrusted sources; data flows are confined within the functions for calculations and returning results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The functions perform standard mathematical and logical operations consistent with their purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions for constraints and change point calculations, relying solely on numpy operations and logical conditions. No network, file, or system command execution exists. No obfuscated or malicious code features detected. The code appears to be legitimate auxiliary functions for optimization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate helper functions for optimization modeling in cvxpy, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
