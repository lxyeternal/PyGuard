{
  "purpose": "Manage package versioning by reading, incrementing, and writing a version number in a local file during setup.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'version' file; writes to 'version' file.",
  "sinks": "File I/O operations on 'version' file; no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Read 'version' -> increment -> write back to 'version' -> use in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling (`except:`), which can mask errors; no validation of file content.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple local file operations for version management, with no network activity or malicious code. The broad exception handling could hide errors but does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard versioning practices. No external inputs or data leaks are involved, and the code does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, straightforward, and performs a common version management task without any malicious intent or security risks. The main concern is error masking due to broad exception handling, which is not a security issue but could be improved for robustness.",
