  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Activity:**  \n   All reports clearly state that the code performs straightforward file I/O operations for version management and package setup. No network activity, data exfiltration, code obfuscation, or malicious behavior is identified. The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Security Concerns:**  \n   The main concern highlighted is the use of a broad `except:` clause, which can silently suppress errors. While this is a poor practice from a robustness perspective, it does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The potential for manipulation exists if the 'version' file is tampered with, but this is a general risk with any file-based versioning system, not a specific security flaw.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** The reports assign low scores (~0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable given the minimal security implications. The main issue is error handling, not malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**  \n   All reports agree on the benign nature of the code and assign similar scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   The code is a standard version management script with no malicious or security-critical issues. The only minor concern is the broad exception handling, which could be improved for robustness but does not impact security.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- The malware score should remain at 0.  \n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.  \n- The security risk score can stay low (~0.1–0.2), acknowledging the broad exception handling but emphasizing the lack of malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to broad exception handling, but not a security flaw)  \n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
