{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'requests' library and prints the string 'test'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data or user input.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the 'print' statement, which outputs to stdout; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from an untrusted source to a sink; the code simply imports a library and outputs a static string.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The import of 'requests' is standard, but it is not used.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' library under an alias and prints 'test'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The import is unused, but this alone is not suspicious. The code structure is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious intent. It appears to be a simple test script or placeholder with no malicious or security concerns.",
