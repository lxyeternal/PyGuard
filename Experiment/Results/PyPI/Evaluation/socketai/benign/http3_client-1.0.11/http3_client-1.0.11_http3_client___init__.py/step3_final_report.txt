  "purpose": "A minimal Python script importing requests as http3_client and printing 'test'.",
  "sources": "Import statement of requests library, print statement",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code executes benignly",
  "anomalies": "Unused import; aliasing requests as http3_client, which could suggest obfuscation but is harmless here",
  "analysis": "The code imports the requests library with an alias and prints a static message. There is no network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The aliasing does not indicate malicious intent, and the code is straightforward. The security risk score assigned in the original reports varies slightly but should be zero, as there is no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor point is the aliasing of requests, which is not suspicious in this context. The overall security assessment should be that the code poses no security risk.",
