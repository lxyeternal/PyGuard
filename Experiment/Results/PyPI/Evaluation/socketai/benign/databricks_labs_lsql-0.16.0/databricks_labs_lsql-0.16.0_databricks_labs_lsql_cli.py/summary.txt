  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the potential misuse of webbrowser.open() if URLs are manipulated externally, but within the current context, this is a low risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, consistent with the analysis. Implementing URL validation could further mitigate any external manipulation concerns, but as it stands, the code is safe and suitable for use."
