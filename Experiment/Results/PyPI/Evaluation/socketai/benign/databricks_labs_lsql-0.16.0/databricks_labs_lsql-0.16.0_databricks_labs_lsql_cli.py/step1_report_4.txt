{
  "purpose": "This script provides CLI commands to create dashboards and format SQL files using the Databricks SDK and associated modules.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include file system (reading SQL files), command-line arguments (folder paths, flags), and environment/context variables (e.g., dashboard IDs).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include opening a URL in a web browser, writing formatted SQL back to files, and printing dashboard IDs. Webbrowser.open() could be misused to open malicious URLs if URLs are controlled or manipulated.",
  "flows": "Source: folder paths, user input; Sink: webbrowser.open() with dashboard URL, file writes; Flow: folder path → read_text() → formatted SQL → write_text(), URL from get_url() → webbrowser.open().",
  "anomalies": "Use of webbrowser.open() based on dashboard URL can be risky if URL is malicious, but here it is generated internally. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious commands, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI commands to create dashboards and format SQL files. The dashboard URL is fetched via a method call and opened in the default browser, which is standard but could be exploited if URL data is manipulated externally. SQL formatting is straightforward and does not involve user input beyond file paths, with no evidence of malicious manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. The webbrowser.open() is used to open generated URLs, which could pose a risk if the URL is malicious, but in this context, it appears safe. Overall, the code performs typical automation tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility for dashboard creation and SQL formatting with no clear malicious behavior. The use of webbrowser.open() should be noted, but it appears safe here as URLs are generated internally. No malware or security risks are evident.",
