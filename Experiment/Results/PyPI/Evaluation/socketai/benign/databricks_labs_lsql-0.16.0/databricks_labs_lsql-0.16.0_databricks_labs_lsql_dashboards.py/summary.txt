  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free from malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are justified. The security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal potential risk from external inputs and API interactions but no active threats. Overall, the supply chain security posture is benign."
