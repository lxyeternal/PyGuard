  "purpose": "Handles dashboard and tile metadata parsing, validation, merging, and API interactions with Databricks SDK for dashboard management, data export, and file handling.",
  "sources": "File reading (_content), external libraries (yaml, sqlglot, databricks.sdk), API calls for dashboard creation/update, file system operations.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints for dashboard creation, update, publish; file writes for CSV exports and YAML configurations.",
  "flows": "File input → parsing/validation → API calls for dashboard management → data export to CSV in ZIP archive.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing, validation, and API interactions for dashboard management. It uses well-known libraries (yaml, sqlglot, databricks.sdk) in a straightforward manner. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Network activity is limited to legitimate API calls. The code handles external inputs carefully, with validation and error handling. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free from malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are justified. The security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal potential risk from external inputs and API interactions but no active threats. Overall, the supply chain security posture is benign.",
