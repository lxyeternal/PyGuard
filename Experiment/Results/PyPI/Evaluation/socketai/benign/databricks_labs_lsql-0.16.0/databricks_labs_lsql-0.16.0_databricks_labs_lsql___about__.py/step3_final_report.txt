  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flows exist.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version string assignment with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
