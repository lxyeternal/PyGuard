  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code patterns. It does not include any external library usage, dynamic code execution, or sensitive information. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier with no malicious or security risks.",
