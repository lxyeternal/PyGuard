  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of SQL and Spark backends with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor security concern relates to potential SQL injection if external inputs are not sanitized, but this is a common and external concern rather than an inherent vulnerability or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, which is justified and appropriate."
