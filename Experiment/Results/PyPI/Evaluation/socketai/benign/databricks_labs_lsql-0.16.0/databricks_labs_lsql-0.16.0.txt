      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of SQL and Spark backends with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor security concern relates to potential SQL injection if external inputs are not sanitized, but this is a common and external concern rather than an inherent vulnerability or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, which is justified and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the potential misuse of webbrowser.open() if URLs are manipulated externally, but within the current context, this is a low risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, consistent with the analysis. Implementing URL validation could further mitigate any external manipulation concerns, but as it stands, the code is safe and suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK setup snippet that configures user agent information. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; minor security risk scores could be adjusted to zero for precision, but 0.1 is acceptable given the context. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure SQL execution utility with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the external link fetching mechanism, which relies on trusted URLs. No evidence of sabotage or malware is detected. The overall risk is low but warrants caution regarding external link validation."

The security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal potential risk from external inputs and API interactions but no active threats. Overall, the supply chain security posture is benign."

There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight variations in security risk scores reflect the complexity of type handling but do not indicate actual risks."
