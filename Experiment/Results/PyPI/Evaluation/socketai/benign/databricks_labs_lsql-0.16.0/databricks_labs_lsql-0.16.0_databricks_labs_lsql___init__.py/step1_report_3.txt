{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports and configure a user-agent string for network requests or logging within a larger SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'databricks.sdk.core' and relative imports for version and core components.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output operations.",
  "flows": "The call to 'with_user_agent_extra' likely modifies global or contextual state related to network or logging behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'with_user_agent_extra' suggests a configuration step; no suspicious variables or code constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and then calls a function to add extra user-agent information, which is standard for SDK configurations. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows from input to output, and no suspicious patterns or behaviors. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a setup purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard SDK setup tasks without any suspicious activity.",
