  "purpose": "This code is intended to import specific modules and set a custom user agent string for SDK interactions, likely for tracking or identification purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'databricks.sdk.core', '__about__', and local 'core' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'with_user_agent_extra' function call potentially modifies headers or configuration for SDK network requests.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> call 'with_user_agent_extra' with package name and version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of 'with_user_agent_extra' appears standard for setting user-agent info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules necessary for SDK functionality, defines an export ('Row'), and sets a custom user agent string with the package name 'lsql' and version. There is no indication of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The function call to 'with_user_agent_extra' is a common pattern for SDK tracking or debugging and does not involve unsafe practices. No obfuscation or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focusing on SDK setup and module exports. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
