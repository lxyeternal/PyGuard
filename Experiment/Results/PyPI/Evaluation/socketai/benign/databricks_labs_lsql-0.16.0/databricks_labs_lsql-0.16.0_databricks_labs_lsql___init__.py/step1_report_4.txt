{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a module that imports specific components and modifies user agent information for a Databricks SDK client.",
  "sources": "Imports from databricks.sdk.core and local modules (__about__, core). The only data input is the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "The function with_user_agent_extra likely modifies network request headers; it does not perform data output or leak data directly.",
  "flows": "Imports are made, and then with_user_agent_extra is called with static strings and the version number; no untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, defines __all__, and calls with_user_agent_extra with static parameters. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data flows to external sinks, and no signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign setup for SDK configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup script for SDK configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard module initialization and modifies user agent headers with static information.",
