  "purpose": "Import core functionalities and version info from Databricks SDK modules and set a user agent for network requests.",
  "sources": "Import statements: databricks.sdk.core, local __about__, and core module.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data output, network activity, or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets a user agent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables, defines __all__, and sets a user agent string with 'lsql' and a version. There are no input/output operations, no data manipulation, and no network activity or dynamic code execution. The setting of user agent appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing module imports and configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
