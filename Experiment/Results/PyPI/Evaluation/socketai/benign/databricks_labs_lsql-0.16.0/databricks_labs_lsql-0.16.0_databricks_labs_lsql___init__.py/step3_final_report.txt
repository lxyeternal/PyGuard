  "purpose": "Configure SDK behavior by setting a custom user agent string for telemetry or identification purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'databricks.sdk.core', local '__about__' module, and local 'core' module; the call to 'with_user_agent_extra'.",
  "sinks": "The function 'with_user_agent_extra' potentially modifies request headers or SDK configuration, which could influence telemetry or network requests.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> call 'with_user_agent_extra' with static strings -> set user agent header for SDK requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; static strings used; no dynamic code execution or data leaks; straightforward SDK setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines an export 'Row', and calls 'with_user_agent_extra' with fixed strings. It appears to be standard SDK configuration code, setting a user agent string for telemetry or identification. No untrusted input, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The minimal nature of the code and the absence of network activity or data processing from untrusted sources indicate benign intent. The security risk scores assigned in the reports (0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight risk reflects the act of setting headers but is common in SDKs. Malware scores are correctly zero, and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the code's clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK setup snippet that configures user agent information. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; minor security risk scores could be adjusted to zero for precision, but 0.1 is acceptable given the context. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
