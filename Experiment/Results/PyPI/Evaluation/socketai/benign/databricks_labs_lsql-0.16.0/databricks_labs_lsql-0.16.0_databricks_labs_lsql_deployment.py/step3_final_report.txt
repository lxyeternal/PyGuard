  "purpose": "Deploy schema, tables, and views for a given inventory schema by loading SQL templates from package resources and executing them.",
  "sources": "Loading SQL scripts via pkgutil.get_data from the specified module.",
  "sinks": "Executing SQL commands through the SqlBackend interface, including CREATE, DROP, and CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statements.",
  "flows": "Load SQL template -> replace placeholder ($inventory) -> execute SQL command.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string replacement without validation; relies on trusted package data; no sanitization or validation of loaded SQL scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code loads SQL templates from package resources, performs placeholder substitution, and executes SQL commands for schema, table, and view management. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the package data; if the SQL scripts are tampered with, malicious SQL could be executed. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with this analysis, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging supply chain trust issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard schema deployment utility with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The primary security consideration is the integrity of package resources. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
