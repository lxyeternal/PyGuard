{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to deploy schemas, tables, and views in a database environment, specifically targeting Databricks or similar systems.",
  "sources": "Reading data from package resources using pkgutil.get_data for loading SQL queries; no external inputs are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Executing SQL commands via self._sql_backend.execute and self._sql_backend.create_table, which may run arbitrary SQL statements.",
  "flows": "Loaded SQL queries from package resources are incorporated into SQL commands (e.g., CREATE VIEW) and executed on the database backend.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting to construct SQL commands directly from resource files and parameters; no explicit sanitization or parameterization observed. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. The SQL load and execution flow appears straightforward and well-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code loads SQL query templates from package resources, modifies them by replacing a placeholder with schema information, and executes SQL commands such as CREATE SCHEMA, DROP SCHEMA, CREATE TABLE, and CREATE VIEW. These operations rely on external SQL files loaded via pkgutil, with no apparent dynamic code execution or user input handling. The replacement of placeholders in SQL templates is static and controlled. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or suspicious code patterns are present. The SQL commands are built using string interpolation but within a controlled context, and the data loaded is from package resources, not user input. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or system compromise mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard schema deployment utility with no evident malicious behavior. It securely loads predefined SQL templates, modifies them safely, and executes them against a database backend. No malicious or sabotage activity is detected.",
