  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward implementation for executing SQL via Databricks SDK, converting results into Row objects, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic, external data fetched over HTTPS, standard error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — seems reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, but highlights that external links fetched via HTTP could be exploited if malicious links are supplied.\n- **Findings:** External links fetched with `requests.get` without validation; potential for data exfiltration if links are malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.4 — this is higher than Report 1, justified given the external link fetch concern.\n- **Assessment:** The concern about unvalidated external links is valid. Fetching external data without validation can be a security risk, especially if external links are controlled by an attacker.\n\n**Justification for risk score > 0.5?**  \nThe risk score is 0.4, which is moderate. Given that external links are fetched without validation, this could be exploited for data exfiltration or malicious payload delivery. However, since the code does not actively perform malicious actions, and the risk depends on external link trustworthiness, 0.4 seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that external links fetched via HTTP could be a privacy or data leak concern but not malicious.\n- **Findings:** External links fetched over HTTP pose a potential privacy risk if URLs are malicious or untrusted.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is justified. No malicious code detected; the main concern is trustworthiness of external links.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlights external link fetching and standard data conversion. No malicious activity observed.\n- **Findings:** External links fetched via HTTP, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The overall security posture appears sound; external link fetches are a known pattern but should be trusted.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizes that external links are fetched over HTTP, with no signs of malicious code.\n- **Findings:** External link fetching, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical SQL execution wrapper with external data fetching, which is standard but should be trusted.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.4, mainly due to external link fetching without validation.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — moderate risk due to external link fetching, which depends on trustworthiness of external URLs. If external links are controlled or validated, this risk diminishes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Remarks:**\n\nThe main security concern in this code is the external link fetching via `requests.get` without validation or verification of the URLs. If these links are manipulated or malicious, data exfiltration or privacy issues could occur. However, there is no evidence of malicious code or sabotage.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Implement validation or whitelisting of external links.\n- Consider adding timeout or SSL verification settings.\n- Document that external links should be trusted or validated externally.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, functional implementation with a moderate security concern related to external link handling. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.2**       |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
