  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward, secure implementation for executing SQL via Databricks SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. It uses standard libraries, handles errors properly, and has no signs of sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious code, no external data exfiltration, no backdoors. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** While mostly standard, the main concern is the fetching of external links via `requests.get` without validation. This could be exploited if malicious URLs are injected, leading to data exfiltration or other malicious activities.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4\n\n- **Assessment:** The suspicion about unvalidated external links is valid. Fetching data from untrusted URLs can be risky, especially if external links are manipulated. However, there's no evidence of malicious code, just a potential attack vector. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with focus on external link fetching via HTTP GET. The main concern is the trustworthiness of external links, which could be exploited for data leaks.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No malware detected, but the external link mechanism warrants caution. The risk score is appropriately low but acknowledges potential concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a robust SQL execution utility with external links for chunked data. No malicious code or sabotage detected. External links are standard but should be trusted.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The risk is low but depends on external link trust.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with emphasis on the external link fetching and data conversion. No malicious activity detected, but external links could be exploited if compromised.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no malware or obfuscation, and a low risk score considering external link reliance.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports find actual malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage. The main concern across multiple reports is the external link fetching via `requests.get` without validation, which could be exploited if external links are maliciously injected or manipulated.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports — no malicious code detected.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation present.\n  - Risk: Varies from 0.1 to 0.4, mainly due to the external links fetching mechanism.\n\n- **Additional Considerations:**\n  - The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n  - Use of `requests` is standard, but external links fetched without validation could be a vector for data exfiltration if links are malicious.\n  - The code handles errors and status checks properly.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** — no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **security risk score** could be slightly increased to **0.3** or **0.4** due to the external link fetching mechanism, which could be exploited if external links are compromised or malicious.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3 — considering the external links fetching pattern and lack of validation, which could be exploited in a supply chain attack or data exfiltration scenario.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured SQL execution utility with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the external link fetching for chunked results, which should be validated or secured in deployment. Overall, the supply chain risk is low but not negligible due to this external data retrieval pattern.",
