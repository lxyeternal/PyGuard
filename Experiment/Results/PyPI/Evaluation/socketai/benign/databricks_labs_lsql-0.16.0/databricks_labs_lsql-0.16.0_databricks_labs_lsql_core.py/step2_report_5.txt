  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward, secure implementation of SQL execution and result fetching via Databricks SDK, with data conversion into a custom Row class. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to external link handling, but overall low.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears secure, standard, and well-implemented.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights potential security concern in fetching data chunks via external links with `requests.get`. The external links are fetched without validation, which could be exploited for data exfiltration or malicious data injection.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected, but the external link fetch pattern is flagged as suspicious.\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — moderate due to external links fetching, which could be manipulated if links are malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** The external link fetching mechanism warrants scrutiny, but no malicious code is present.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 2, emphasizing that external links are fetched via HTTP GET, which could be a privacy or security concern if links are maliciously controlled.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware, but external link handling is flagged.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — lower than Report 2, but still noteworthy.\n- **Conclusion:** External link fetching is the main concern; otherwise, the code is standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the same pattern—external links fetched via HTTP GET, standard data conversion, robust error handling. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Conclusion:** Similar to previous, external links are the main point of concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with prior reports, no malicious code, but external link fetching is noted as a potential security concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** Given the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage, **malware should remain at 0**.\n- **Security risk:** The primary concern is the fetching of external links via `requests.get` without validation, which could be exploited if external links are maliciously supplied or manipulated. The risk is moderate but depends on trust in the external link sources. A conservative estimate would be **around 0.2–0.3**.\n- **Overall confidence:** High, given consistent findings.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The external link fetching pattern is the only aspect that could be exploited if links are malicious. Implementing validation, such as URL whitelisting or signature verification, would mitigate this.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware, so scores should remain at 0 for malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Scores:**\n\n| Category             | Score |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| **Malware**         | **0**  |\n| **Obfuscated**      | **0**  |\n| **Security Risk**   | **0.2** (or possibly 0.3 if conservative) |\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, secure implementation with a minor concern related to external link fetching, but no malicious activity detected.**",
