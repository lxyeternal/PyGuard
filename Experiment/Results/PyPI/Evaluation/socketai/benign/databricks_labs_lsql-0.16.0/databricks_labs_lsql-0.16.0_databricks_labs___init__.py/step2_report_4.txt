  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: importing 'pkgutil' and extending '__path__' for namespace package support.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: maintaining namespace package compatibility.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are reported or evident.\n- The code is a standard pattern documented in Python packaging guides.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content and security implications:\n\n**Original code:**\n```python\n# DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE TO THIS FILE FOR COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER databricks.* PACKAGES\n# SEE https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkgutil-style-namespace-packages\n__path__ = __import__(\"pkgutil\").extend_path(__path__, __name__)\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- This is a well-known, standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python.\n- It only manipulates `__path__` to include additional locations for package resolution.\n- It does not execute any external code, process untrusted data, or perform network I/O.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Issue presence:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  **No.** The code is benign and aligns with best practices for namespace packages.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The code is straightforward, minimal, and well-documented. No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Given the benign and standard pattern, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely for namespace support and involves no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Validity of conclusions:\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, which is accurate.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is a standard, well-documented namespace package support snippet.**\n- **No issues, no malicious intent, no security risks.**\n- **Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard namespace package pattern with no malicious or risky behavior. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe.
