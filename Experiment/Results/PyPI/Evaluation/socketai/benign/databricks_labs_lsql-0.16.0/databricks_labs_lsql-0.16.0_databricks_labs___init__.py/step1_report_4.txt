{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to modify the package namespace path for compatibility with other databricks.* packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ with __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is from importing 'pkgutil' to extending __path__, which is a standard namespace package operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; the code is a standard namespace package compatibility workaround.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies __path__ to support namespace package features, which is common in large, modular Python packages. It relies on 'pkgutil.extend_path' to include multiple paths for the namespace. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code are present. The comments clarify that this code is only for compatibility and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard snippet used to support namespace packages in Python. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are detected.",
