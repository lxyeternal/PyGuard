  "purpose": "Maintain compatibility with other databricks.* namespace packages using pkgutil",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path on __path__ with __name__",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leak; no external network or system modifications",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code only modifies __path__ for namespace package compatibility",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward namespace package setup code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages using pkgutil.extend_path. It imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ to include additional package locations. This pattern is commonly used to support modular namespace packages and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no data sources, sinks, or unusual behaviors. The code is minimal, simple, and well-documented for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign namespace package compatibility snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
