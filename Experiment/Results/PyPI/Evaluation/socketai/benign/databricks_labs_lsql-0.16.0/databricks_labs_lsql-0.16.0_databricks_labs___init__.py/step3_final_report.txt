  "purpose": "Support for namespace package compatibility by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' and extension of '__path__' variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend '__path__' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a standard pattern for namespace packages, straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a common namespace package support pattern in Python, importing 'pkgutil' and extending '__path__' for namespace resolution across multiple distributions. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The code does not involve data flows from untrusted sources, network I/O, or external code execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of this pattern. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and well-known pattern of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package support snippet with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
