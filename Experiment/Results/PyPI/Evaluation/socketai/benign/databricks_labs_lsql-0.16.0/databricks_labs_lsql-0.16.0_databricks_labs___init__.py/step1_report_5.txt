{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to maintain compatibility with other databricks.* namespace packages by extending the __path__ variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable, and the dynamic import of 'pkgutil' to extend __path__.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'pkgutil' to extending __path__, which affects package namespace resolution.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. No obfuscation or unusual features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a standard method for handling namespace packages by extending __path__ via 'pkgutil'. It references a specific Python packaging approach for namespace packages, aligning with documented practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The code's purpose is clearly stated in the comment, and the implementation is simple and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign snippet used for namespace package compatibility within the databricks package ecosystem. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
