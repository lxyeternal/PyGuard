  "purpose": "Static utility to infer Spark SQL types and schemas from Python dataclasses, enums, and type hints.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, dataclasses, get_type_hints, enum metadata, standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "Generates SQL type strings and schema descriptions.",
  "flows": "Type hints and dataclass fields are processed to produce SQL representations via recursive inference.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external I/O detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static type inference using standard Python features, including dataclasses, typing, and enum. It converts Python types into SQL schema strings, handling nullable types, containers, and nested structures. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0–0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for translating Python type annotations into Spark SQL types and schemas. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight variations in security risk scores reflect the complexity of type handling but do not indicate actual risks.",
