{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes and methods to infer Spark SQL types from Python dataclasses, enums, and standard types, primarily for schema generation and data type translation.",
  "sources": "Type hints from dataclasses, enums, and standard Python types; class and method definitions; imported modules such as dataclasses, datetime, enum, types, and typing.",
  "sinks": "Methods converting types to SQL schema representations (as_sql, as_schema); no direct data sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Type hints are parsed via _infer and related methods to produce SQL type representations; no untrusted data sources or direct data flow to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard Python features and typing hints; no hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to infer SQL data types from Python types, including dataclasses, enums, and standard types. It handles nullability, nested structures, and generics like lists and dicts. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The functions strictly perform type inference and string formatting for schema representation. The absence of external data operations or insecure patterns suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for schema inference and type translation from Python data models to Spark SQL representations. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or hidden behaviors. Overall, it is safe based on the provided code.",
