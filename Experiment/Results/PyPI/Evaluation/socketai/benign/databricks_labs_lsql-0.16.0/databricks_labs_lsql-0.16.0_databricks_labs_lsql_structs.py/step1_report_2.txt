{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for inferring Spark SQL types from Python data types, including support for dataclasses, enums, and generic types, and generating corresponding DDL and schema representations.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, dataclass definitions, imports, and internal method calls within the class methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to as_sql() and as_schema() methods that generate SQL type strings and schema descriptions.",
  "flows": "Type inference flows from _infer method through specific handlers (_infer_struct, _infer_primitive, _infer_generic, etc.) to produce SQL representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no network operations, no file manipulations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code. Use of standard Python typing and dataclasses for type inference. No signs of malicious privacy violations or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on type inference and schema generation for Python dataclasses and type annotations. It imports standard modules, uses safe type checking, and contains no network, file, or system command executions. The functions are purely computational, with no input/output handling beyond type analysis. No malicious patterns, suspicious functions, or hidden behaviors are detected. It appears to be a well-structured utility for type mapping without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type inference utility aimed at generating Spark SQL type strings and schemas from Python data structures. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to safe coding practices.",
