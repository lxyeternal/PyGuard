{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions to infer Spark SQL types from Python data structures, particularly dataclasses and type hints, and generate SQL DDL and schema representations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are Python type annotations, dataclasses, and enums used for type inference.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, files, or network; it mainly generates string representations of types.",
  "flows": "Type annotations are parsed by _infer, which calls specific methods (_infer_struct, _infer_primitive, etc.) to produce SqlType objects, then methods like as_sql or as_schema generate string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed. No obfuscated code present. No dynamic execution, code injection, or external network calls identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured and well-defined approach to inferring SQL types from Python dataclasses and type hints. It uses standard Python features like dataclasses, type hints, and the typing module. The logic is straightforward, and no external or hidden operations are present. The code does not perform any I/O, network access, or malicious actions. All operations are static, focused on type analysis and string formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for SQL type inference from Python data structures without any malicious behavior or security risks. It only generates SQL type strings and schemas based on provided Python types. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected.",
