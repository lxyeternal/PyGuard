{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to maintain namespace compatibility for a Python package related to databricks, ensuring it can coexist with other packages in a namespace package setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__path__' variable, which is a standard part of Python's package initialization, and uses 'pkgutil.extend_path' to modify it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code does not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'pkgutil' to extending the '__path__' variable for namespace package compatibility, with no data passing to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code's sole function is to extend the package's '__path__' to support namespace packages using 'pkgutil'. It includes no external input, no data processing beyond namespace setup, and no suspicious constructs. Its purpose aligns with standard package management practices and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of namespace package support, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
