  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend __path__ -> assign to __path__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard namespace package pattern with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies '__path__' via 'extend_path' to support namespace packages. It contains no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The pattern is well-known and widely used in Python packaging. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The code is minimal, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for namespace support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for namespace package compatibility with no security risks or malicious behavior. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation.",
