{
  "purpose": "This code is used to declare a namespace package, allowing the package to be split across multiple directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __path__ and imports 'pkgutil' to extend the namespace.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__, which is a standard operation for namespace packages without involving external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages, with no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies the __path__ variable to support namespace packaging. It explicitly states not to add anything else for compatibility, which aligns with standard practices. No code execution, data processing, or external input handling is present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation. It is a typical snippet used in Python namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for namespace packages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
