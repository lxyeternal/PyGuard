  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ variable for namespace package compatibility.",
  "sources": "The line importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not handle input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies __path__, which influences module search paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious behavior or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the __path__ for a namespace package to ensure compatibility across different distributions. It uses the standard 'pkgutil.extend_path' function without any additional logic, input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behaviors. The purpose appears purely to facilitate namespace package functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for namespace packages to extend their search paths. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
