{
  "purpose": "The code comprises unit tests for the dragnet.data_processing module, focusing on file handling, reading, and data extraction functions within a controlled test environment.",
  "sources": "Local filesystem operations such as reading files, listing directory contents, and matching filename patterns.",
  "sinks": "None; all data flows are confined to local file I/O with no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files created within temporary directories; no external data or network interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard Python libraries for file operations and testing. It creates temporary files, reads content, and verifies expected outputs without executing external code or network activities. All operations are within a controlled environment, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for data processing functions, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
