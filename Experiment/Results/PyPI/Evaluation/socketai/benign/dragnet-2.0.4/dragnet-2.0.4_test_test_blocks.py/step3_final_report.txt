  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'dragnet.blocks' module, testing encoding detection, text extraction, and HTML structure analysis using controlled data and standard libraries.",
  "sources": "Reading local HTML files and in-memory HTML strings",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or data exfiltration",
  "flows": "Processing input data through parsing functions without external sinks or dynamic code execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code operates solely within a testing context, utilizing standard libraries and controlled data. It performs no network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads. The functions tested are standard parsing and feature extraction routines. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, controlled nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of unit tests with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its safe and controlled behavior.",
