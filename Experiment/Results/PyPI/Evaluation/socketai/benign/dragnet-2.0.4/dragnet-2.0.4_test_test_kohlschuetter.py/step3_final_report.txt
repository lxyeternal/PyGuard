  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'dragnet' library, focusing on HTML parsing, tokenization, and feature extraction.",
  "sources": "Static HTML strings and files read during tests, primarily in-memory data.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration; all processing is internal.",
  "flows": "Parsing HTML from strings/files to tokenization and feature extraction assertions within the test framework.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured test suite verifying HTML parsing robustness, tokenization, and feature extraction. It uses standard libraries and static test data, with no external communication or malicious patterns. The tests cover error handling, nested tags, unicode, comments, invalid bytes, and large HTML input, all in a controlled environment. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to reading external test files, which is typical in testing contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing suite with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects its testing purpose without any threat indicators.",
