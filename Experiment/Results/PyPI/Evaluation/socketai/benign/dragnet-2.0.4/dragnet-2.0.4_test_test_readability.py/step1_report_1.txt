  "purpose": "Unit testing the readability feature extraction from HTML content using dragnet library functions.",
  "sources": "Reading HTML content from a file in 'test/datafiles/models_testing.html' and reading expected JSON features from 'test/datafiles/readability_features.json'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in sensitive operations; no external data is transmitted or executed.",
  "flows": "Reading file content (source) and passing it to 'TagCountReadabilityBlockifier.blockify' (sink), then comparing results; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward unit tests by reading test data files, invoking functions from the 'dragnet' library, and comparing output features to expected results. No external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no use of untrusted input sources other than controlled test files. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical unit test for validating feature extraction functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
