{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for the dragnet library, specifically testing readability feature extraction from HTML content.",
  "sources": "Reading HTML content from a file ('models_testing.html') within the test data directory.",
  "sinks": "Loading JSON data from 'readability_features.json' and converting it into a numpy array.",
  "flows": "Reading HTML content from a file (source), processing it with dragnet's functions, then loading JSON data and comparing feature arrays (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic execution, no external network calls, no use of environment variables, and no cryptographic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads static test files, processes HTML through dragnet's blockifier and readability functions, then compares the computed features to expected results. The test structure is standard, with no dynamic code execution or data manipulation beyond file I/O. No evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for validating readability feature extraction, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
