  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'dragnet' content extraction library, validating extraction accuracy and robustness.",
  "sources": "Reads static HTML and JSON files from local filesystem for testing data.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; operates solely on local files and in-memory data.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> Calls extraction functions -> Compares results -> Asserts correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that loads local test data, invokes extraction functions, and asserts expected outcomes. It contains no network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. Commented-out code is benign and typical in testing scripts. No vulnerabilities or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit testing script with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on local files, performs standard validation, and contains no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
