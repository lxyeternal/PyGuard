  "purpose": "Unit testing for dragnet content extraction functions, verifying accuracy and consistency of output.",
  "sources": "Reading HTML content from file in setUp method, reading JSON expected data from file.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks present; no external network or system modifications involved.",
  "flows": "HTML content from file -> extraction functions -> comparison with expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured unit tests on dragnet's content extraction functions. It reads static HTML and JSON data files, processes them with various extractors, and compares the results to expected outputs. The code is straightforward, uses standard testing practices, and contains no external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears purely for testing purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for content extraction functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It operates solely on static data files and performs validation checks. No malware, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
