{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the _weninger.sx_sdx function within the dragnet.features module",
  "sources": "np.linspace for generating input data; import statements for dependencies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no output to external systems; no data leaks",
  "flows": "Input data from np.linspace flows into _weninger.sx_sdx function; results are compared internally",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard unit test structure; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a specific feature module. It defines a test case class that calls _weninger.sx_sdx with a numpy array generated by linspace, then asserts the output matches expected results. The test appears straightforward, designed to validate the correctness of the function. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit test script for a mathematical function, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply verifies the correctness of the feature extraction function without any suspicious behavior.",
