  "purpose": "Unit testing for the _weninger.sx_sdx function within the dragnet.features module.",
  "sources": "Input data generated by np.linspace, and the imported _weninger.sx_sdx function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data (np.linspace output) passed to _weninger.sx_sdx, result compared to expected array.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward unit test without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a specific function from a module, then performs a unit test by generating a sequence of values, calling the target function, and verifying the output matches expected values. The test is standard, with no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. No use of external data sources or network communication. The imported module _weninger is presumed benign given context and naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate unit test with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It tests numerical computations and verifies correctness. No malicious intent or malicious code detected.",
