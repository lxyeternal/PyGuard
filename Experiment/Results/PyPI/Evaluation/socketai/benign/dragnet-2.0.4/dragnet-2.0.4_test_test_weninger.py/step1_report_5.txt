  "purpose": "Unit testing for the _weninger.sx_sdx function in the dragnet.features module",
  "sources": "np.linspace to generate input data",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Input from np.linspace is processed by _weninger.sx_sdx, results are compared to expected values",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed; standard testing code",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward unit test: generating input data with np.linspace, calling the function _weninger.sx_sdx, and comparing the output to expected values using assertions. The code imports standard libraries and a specific feature from a local module, with no network operations, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. There are no obfuscation techniques, hidden code, or malicious payloads present. The code appears to be a standard test case for validating a function's correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard unit test script with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified. It solely verifies the correctness of a function within the context of testing, with no suspicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
