  "purpose": "Unit test for the '_weninger.sx_sdx' function in the 'dragnet.features' module, verifying its output against expected values.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'x' array generated by np.linspace(0, 10, 10)",
  "sinks": "Function call to '_weninger.sx_sdx(x)' which processes input data",
  "flows": "Input array 'x' flows into '_weninger.sx_sdx', producing output 'actual' for comparison against 'expected'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard unit test structure, importing known libraries and performing straightforward assertions",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing and numerical libraries, defines a test case class for the '_weninger.sx_sdx' function, and verifies that function output matches precomputed expected values. No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly performs a unit test with predictable inputs and outputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test for a feature extraction function. No malicious activity or security risks are identified. The code appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
