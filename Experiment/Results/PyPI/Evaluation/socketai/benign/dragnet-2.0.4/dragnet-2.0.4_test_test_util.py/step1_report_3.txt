{
  "purpose": "Unit testing utility functions and feature union composition in a machine learning context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data for tests, such as the predicted and actual text lists, and imports modules and classes for feature extraction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points are present; no sensitive data handling or network operations are detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (predicted and actual lists) through evaluation metrics calculations; feature union configurations flow from function calls to class instantiations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard unit testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit tests using the unittest framework. It tests evaluation metrics calculations, feature union configurations, and class instantiations for feature extractors. No external data or network activity occurs, and no code manipulates sensitive information or executes dynamic code. The code structure is typical for test modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. All imported modules and functions are from open-source, publicly available packages. No unusual or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for feature extraction and evaluation metrics in a machine learning pipeline. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks. The code appears safe and benign.",
