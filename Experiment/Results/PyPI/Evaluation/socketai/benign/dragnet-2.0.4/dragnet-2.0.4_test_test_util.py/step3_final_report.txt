{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for utility functions and feature union handling within the dragnet package, verifying evaluation metrics and feature composition.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from hardcoded lists and predefined objects within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks; all data remains in-memory during test execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the predefined input variables through function calls within the test methods; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests that invoke functions with static, controlled data. It imports standard and custom modules but does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure and data handling are typical for testing scenarios, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for utility functions and feature handling in an ML pipeline. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
