{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'util' module and feature classes in a machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (sklearn, dragnet), function calls within test cases, and data used for evaluation metrics.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code mainly performs calculations, feature union constructions, and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input data (predicted and actual strings) flows into evaluation metrics functions; feature identifiers flow into feature union constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard unit tests for a machine learning utility module, testing evaluation metrics and feature union creation. No external data is fetched, network connections, or file manipulations are involved. The code performs in-memory calculations and object instantiations with no suspicious logic or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard testing code for a ML pipeline's utility functions and feature composition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
