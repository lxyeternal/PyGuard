  "purpose": "Unit testing the util module functions and feature union handling in dragnet.",
  "sources": "Imports from sklearn, dragnet.features, and dragnet.util; test methods using predefined data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output; no network, file, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Test functions process static data and invoke utility functions without external dependencies or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing on utility functions and feature union constructors. It imports known libraries and custom modules, tests method outputs with controlled input data, and asserts expected results. No external or untrusted data sources, no network operations, no cryptographic or system modification code. The code structure follows standard testing practices. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite for utility functions and feature composition. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and presents no security risks.",
