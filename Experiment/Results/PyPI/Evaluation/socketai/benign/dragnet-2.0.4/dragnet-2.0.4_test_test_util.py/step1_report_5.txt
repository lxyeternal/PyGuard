  "purpose": "Unit testing the util module functions related to evaluation metrics and feature union creation in the dragnet package.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'unittest', 'sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion', 'dragnet.features', and 'dragnet.util'. No user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external outputs; no network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines test functions calling 'util.evaluation_metrics' and 'util.get_and_union_features' with controlled inputs; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward unit tests with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unittests for functions in the 'util' module of 'dragnet'. It verifies evaluation metrics calculation and feature union creation with various input types. All functions and imported modules are standard or part of the tested package. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are observed. The structure is typical for test code, with no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign test code intended to validate utility functions within the dragnet package. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
