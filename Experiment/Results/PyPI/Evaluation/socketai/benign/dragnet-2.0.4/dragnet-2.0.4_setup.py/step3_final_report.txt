{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for building the 'dragnet' Python package with Cython extensions, configuring compilation parameters and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for include directories, environment variables for platform detection, and package data files.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network transmission, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads filesystem paths and environment info to configure build extensions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: locating include directories, defining Cython extension modules, and setting package metadata. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute runtime logic that could be malicious. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical build scripts. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The security risk is minimal, related only to build environment assumptions, and the malware score is zero due to the absence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
