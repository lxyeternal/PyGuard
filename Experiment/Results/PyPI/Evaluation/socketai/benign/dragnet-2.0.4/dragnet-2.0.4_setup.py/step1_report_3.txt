{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for building and installing the 'dragnet' Python package, which extracts main content from web pages, and includes Cython extensions for performance.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables (e.g., sys.platform), filesystem (os.path.exists), and package metadata from within the setup script.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard package installation functions, compilation flags, and external library dependencies; no direct data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from filesystem checks and environment variables into build configuration and extension compilation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Uses standard build and extension mechanisms. No network connections or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, including locating system headers, configuring Cython extension modules, and specifying package metadata. It relies on standard practices for building Cython modules with external dependencies (libxml2, numpy, etc.). No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious external communications. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate setup script for a content extraction package that uses Cython extensions. It contains no malicious code or suspicious behavior, and follows standard package build conventions.",
