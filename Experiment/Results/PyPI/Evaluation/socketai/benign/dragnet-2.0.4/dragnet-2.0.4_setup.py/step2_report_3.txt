  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script for building Cython extensions, with no malicious activity or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (probably conservative but acceptable given the context).\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected; code is purely for build configuration.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup practices with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, which is appropriate).\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; only environment and build configuration.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard build setup with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious logic or external communications.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard package setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; straightforward build script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just package configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but all are appropriately low, given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware score should remain at **0** for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0** as no obfuscation is present.\n- The risk score can be set at **0** or **0.1**; given the consistent benign nature, **0** is more appropriate.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments, and the scores are reasonable. The code is a standard setup script with no security concerns.",
