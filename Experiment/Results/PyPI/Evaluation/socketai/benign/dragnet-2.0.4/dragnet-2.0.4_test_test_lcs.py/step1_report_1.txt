  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'check_inclusion' function from the 'dragnet.lcs' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a function from an external library and uses hardcoded test data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or data leaks; standard testing assertions only.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the test performs static assertions with predefined data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a simple unit test on a function imported from an external module. It does not process user input or untrusted data, nor does it include network operations, file manipulations, or other suspicious behaviors. The test data appears benign and solely for validation purposes. There is no indication of obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test script with no malicious intent or security risks. It imports a function and tests it with fixed data. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
