  "purpose": "Unit test for the dragnet content extractor using a pre-trained logistic regression model",
  "sources": "File input from 'test/datafiles/models_testing.html', imports from standard and third-party libraries, and internal function calls",
  "sinks": "None that directly handle untrusted data; no data leaks or system modifications observed",
  "flows": "Reads HTML content from a file -> processes through dragnet components -> performs model prediction -> outputs extracted content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or unusual code structures, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, reads an HTML file, sets up a scikit-learn logistic regression model with explicit parameters, and performs content extraction. All operations are contained within a controlled testing environment, with no indications of malicious behavior. Model parameters are hardcoded but benign. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, and no system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward unit test for a content extraction system with a pre-trained model. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are detected.",
