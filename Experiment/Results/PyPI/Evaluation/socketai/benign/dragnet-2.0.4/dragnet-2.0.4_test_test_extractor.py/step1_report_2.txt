{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a unit test for a content extraction process using a machine learning model and text blockifier.",
  "sources": "Reads an HTML file ('test/datafiles/models_testing.html') from disk.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is output to external systems or network; the code only processes and compares data internally.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> Processes HTML content -> Uses ML model for prediction -> Generates extracted content as string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries and well-known packages. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward unit test: it loads HTML data, configures a logistic regression model with pre-defined attributes, and uses a custom extractor to parse and predict content from the HTML. It compares the extractor's output with a manual extraction method. No network activity, no system modification, and no suspicious behaviors are observed. The code relies on well-known libraries and standard patterns. It appears to be a legitimate test script for functionality verification without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script designed to verify the extraction process and model predictions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code appears safe.",
