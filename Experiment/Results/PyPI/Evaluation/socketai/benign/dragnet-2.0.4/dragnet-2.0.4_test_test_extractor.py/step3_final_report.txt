  "purpose": "Unit test for content extraction pipeline using Dragnet with a pre-trained logistic regression model.",
  "sources": "Reads static HTML file 'models_testing.html' from local disk.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; processes data locally within the test environment.",
  "flows": "Reads HTML -> extracts blocks -> transforms features -> predicts with model -> compares output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that loads a static HTML file, sets up a logistic regression model with hardcoded parameters (typical for testing), and performs content extraction and comparison. No network activity, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The model parameters are manually assigned but are from a pre-trained model, not malicious code. The test verifies that the extractor produces expected output. Scores from reports align with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test script with no malicious intent or activity. It does not contain obfuscation or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 or very close to it, reflecting the safe nature of the code.",
