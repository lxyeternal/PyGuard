{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract serialization interface and provides concrete implementations for no-operation and JSON payload serialization.",
  "sources": "Methods receive data as parameters; no external data sources or inputs are read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned directly; no sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through serialize/deserialize methods, returning processed data without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a standard serialization framework using well-known libraries. It performs straightforward data transformations without side effects, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The use of 'jsonutils.to_primitive' is safe and intended for safe serialization. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard serialization utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate low scores. No modifications are necessary.",
