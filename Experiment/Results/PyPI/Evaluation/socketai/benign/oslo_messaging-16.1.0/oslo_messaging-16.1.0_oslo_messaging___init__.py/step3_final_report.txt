  "purpose": "Import statements for a Python package, likely for module initialization or component inclusion.",
  "sources": "Local module imports from the package directory (.exceptions, .notify, .rpc, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely import statements with no data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, dynamic behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with a license header, indicating a module setup. No network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import pattern is standard for Python packages, and the license header is typical for open-source modules. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reports, all of which correctly identify the lack of malicious intent. The minimal security risk and malware scores are appropriate; the obfuscated score is zero. Slightly elevated risk scores (e.g., 0.1) in some reports are unjustified given the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import block with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the overall security risk is negligible. No adjustments are necessary; the code poses no security threat.",
