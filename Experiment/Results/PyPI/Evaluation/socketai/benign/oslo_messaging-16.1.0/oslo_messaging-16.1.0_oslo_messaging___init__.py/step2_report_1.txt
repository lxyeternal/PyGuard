  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Nature:**\n   - The code is a set of import statements from local modules within a Python package.\n   - It includes a standard license header.\n   - There are no executable functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The imports are straightforward, suggesting a modular package structure.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No external data handling, network operations, or data sinks.\n   - The code is purely structural, meant for module initialization or component inclusion.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n   - They correctly identify that it is a standard import module with no malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), and no anomalies or security risks are identified.\n   - The \"securityRisk\" scores are minimal, reflecting the absence of any active security concerns.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n   - **Risk Score:** The scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1). Given the lack of any suspicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n5. **Justification for Scores:**\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should stay at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The overall security risk should be minimal, close to 0, as the code is purely structural.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The only minor point is the use of relative imports, which is common in Python packages and not inherently suspicious.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified based solely on import statements.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the code is benign.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, 0, and near 0 respectively.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign module import block with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should not be changed.\n- No further security concerns are indicated based on this fragment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
