  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation build, with no dynamic or executable code.",
  "sources": "Configuration variables and comments; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; static code with no data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured Sphinx configuration file containing only comments, variable assignments, and extension lists. It does not process external inputs, execute code, or perform network operations. All indicators point to benign, static setup with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. Confidence is high (1), given the static nature and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
