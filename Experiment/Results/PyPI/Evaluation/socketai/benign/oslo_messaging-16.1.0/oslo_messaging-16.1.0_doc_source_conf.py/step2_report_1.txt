  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and nature:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation, with no dynamic code execution, no external input, and no data sinks. The code consists of standard project metadata, extension lists, and theme options, all typical for such configuration files.\n\n2. **Malicious behavior and anomalies:**  \nAll reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external data fetching, no code obfuscation, and no signs of malware.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning:**  \n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malware or malicious intent identified.  \n- **Security risk (0):** Correct, static configuration with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \nAll reports are consistent and cautious, correctly concluding that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Critical observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration file, with no runtime data handling, no external dependencies beyond extension names, and no execution of untrusted code.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation.\n- The reports' assessments and scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's content.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, readable, standard configuration.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
