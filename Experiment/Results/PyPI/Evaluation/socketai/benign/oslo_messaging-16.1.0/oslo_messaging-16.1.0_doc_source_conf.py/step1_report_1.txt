  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration without runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. All code appears standard for a documentation configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file containing metadata, extension settings, and theme options. No external input is read at runtime, and no sensitive data, environment variables, or code execution mechanisms are present. The structure and content are typical for documentation setup scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
