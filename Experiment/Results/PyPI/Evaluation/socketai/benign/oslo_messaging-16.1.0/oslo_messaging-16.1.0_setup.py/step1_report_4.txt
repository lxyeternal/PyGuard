  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with parameters to require 'pbr>=2.0.0' and enable PBR. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data is used. The structure and syntax are standard and typical for Python package setup files. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior.",
