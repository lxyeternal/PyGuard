  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup' with parameters to require 'pbr>=2.0.0' and enable pbr. The license header is standard and only informational. No code execution, dynamic data, or external input handling is present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs a straightforward configuration for package building.",
