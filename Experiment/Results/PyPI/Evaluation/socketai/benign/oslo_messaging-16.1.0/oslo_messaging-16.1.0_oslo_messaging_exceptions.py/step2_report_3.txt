  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only defines exception classes.\n- No external data input, network operations, or data processing is present.\n- The constructors perform straightforward string concatenation and attribute assignments.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be standard, benign, and intended for error handling in a messaging system.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The \"malware\" score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is purely a set of exception class definitions with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements.\n- The risk score should remain at **0.0**.\n- The malware score should be **0.0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0.0**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code fragment is benign, standard, and safe. It does not pose any security risks or contain malware. The provided scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to review additional code or reports.",
