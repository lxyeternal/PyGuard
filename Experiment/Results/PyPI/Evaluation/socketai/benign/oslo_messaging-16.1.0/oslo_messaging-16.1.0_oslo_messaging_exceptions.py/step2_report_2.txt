  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code itself:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions.\n   - No external input, data processing, or network operations are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - The only dynamic operation is string concatenation in `InvalidTarget.__init__`, which is standard for error messages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - They emphasize the lack of external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and benign purpose, these scores are reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions with no external interactions, so the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions. It does not introduce any security vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and align with my analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI concur with the existing scores. No changes are necessary.",
