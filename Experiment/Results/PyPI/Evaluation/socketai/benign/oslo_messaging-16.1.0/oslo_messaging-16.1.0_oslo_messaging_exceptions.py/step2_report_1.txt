  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code defines several custom exception classes related to messaging errors.\n- No external data input, no network operations, no data processing.\n- Constructors perform simple string concatenation and attribute assignment.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes.\n- Analysis: Accurate; no external input, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (since no risks are identified, but default to 0.5 for safety).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, reaffirming benign nature.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above; no issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, straightforward exception class definitions.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, I would assign a risk score of **0** for all reports, as there are no vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n\n**Note:** The reports' assigned scores seem reasonable, as they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
