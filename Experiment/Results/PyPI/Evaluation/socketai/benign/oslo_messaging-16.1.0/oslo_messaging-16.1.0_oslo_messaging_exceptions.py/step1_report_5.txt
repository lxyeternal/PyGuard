  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for messaging-related errors and handle messaging failures.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__ methods) where exception data is assigned, and the module import section.",
  "sinks": "None of the exception classes or their data are used in a way that leads to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; exception data is handled internally and raised appropriately.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. Exception classes are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for messaging errors, with constructors that process input parameters. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The class hierarchy appears standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for messaging systems. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
