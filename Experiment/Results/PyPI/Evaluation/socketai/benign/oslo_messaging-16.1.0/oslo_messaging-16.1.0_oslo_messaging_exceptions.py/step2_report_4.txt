  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes related to messaging errors.\n   - No external data input, network operations, or data processing.\n   - Constructors perform simple string concatenation and attribute assignment.\n   - No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Malware and Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for exception handling.\n\n3. **Security Risks**:\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.\n   - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 is correct.\n   - **Risk score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no external interactions, there's no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n   - The constructors are simple and do not perform any complex or suspicious operations.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
