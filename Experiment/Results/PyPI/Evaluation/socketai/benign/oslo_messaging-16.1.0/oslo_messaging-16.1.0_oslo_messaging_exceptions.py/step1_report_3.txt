{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for messaging-related errors and control flow in a messaging system.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data processing or output operations that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only creates exception classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; standard exception class definitions with minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for a messaging system. It defines several exception subclasses, some with custom constructors to include additional context (e.g., target, exchange, routing key). There are no input reads, no network operations, and no code execution or data processing. The constructors merely assign attributes and format messages. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors are present. Overall, the code appears to serve as part of a larger system's error handling and does not contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be involved in supply chain attacks or contain malware. No security concerns are identified.",
