  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes for messaging errors.\n- No external data input, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be a benign part of a larger messaging library.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The only notable operation is string concatenation in `InvalidTarget.__init__`, which is standard for error message formatting.\n- No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The exception classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, with no unusual behavior.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, indicating no security risk. Given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior, a score of 0.0 or 0.1 seems reasonable. Slightly above zero could be justified if considering that exception classes could be misused in a broader context, but in isolation, 0 is more appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed; the scores accurately reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
