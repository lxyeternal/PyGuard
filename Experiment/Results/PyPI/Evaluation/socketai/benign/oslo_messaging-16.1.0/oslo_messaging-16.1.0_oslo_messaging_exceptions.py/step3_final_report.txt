{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for messaging errors and related conditions.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from constructor parameters for error messages, specifically in InvalidTarget and MessageUndeliverable classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception message strings and attribute assignments, but no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with standard string concatenation for messages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several custom exception classes related to messaging, with constructors performing simple string concatenation and attribute assignments. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard, benign, and designed for error handling. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The exception classes inherit from built-in exceptions, and their implementation is straightforward. The absence of external data handling or network activity indicates no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for messaging errors. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
