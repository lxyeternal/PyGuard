  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for messaging-related errors in a software system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data is written or sent to untrusted sources; no sink functions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external input or untrusted data; this code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes related to messaging errors. No external data inputs, no data processing, and no network operations. The classes are standard and contain no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior. The only notable operation is concatenating a string with a target in the InvalidTarget constructor, which is normal behavior for error message formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for messaging error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this code fragment.",
