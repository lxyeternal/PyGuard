{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for messaging-related errors and timeouts.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; the code defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; only class constructors and attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception handling involves only internal data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions used for messaging error handling. It does not process input, handle external data, or execute any network or system operations. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be part of a larger messaging library, with standard exception subclassing and attribute storage. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external operations or data handling that could be exploited. Overall, it appears benign and safe.",
