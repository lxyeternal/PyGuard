  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for messaging-related error handling in a larger system.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines classes and does not include data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs observed; standard exception class definitions with straightforward constructors.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes related to messaging errors, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception classes. There are no input/output operations, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The constructors perform simple string concatenation and attribute assignment, which are typical for exception classes. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
