{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and classes related to HTTP connections, NTLM authentication, and adapters, and then exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .adapters, .connection, .core, .requests_ntlm2",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute commands",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a straightforward import and export module setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs import statements and defines __all__ for module exports. It references internal modules which likely handle networking, NTLM authentication, and connection management. No potentially malicious or suspicious code, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The module's purpose appears to be to organize and expose functionality related to HTTP and NTLM authentication, without any apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export setup without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a benign part of a larger library related to network connections and authentication.",
