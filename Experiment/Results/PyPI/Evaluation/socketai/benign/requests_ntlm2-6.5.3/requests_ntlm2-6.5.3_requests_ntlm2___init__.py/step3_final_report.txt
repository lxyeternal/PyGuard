  "purpose": "Module export setup for HTTP and NTLM authentication components",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.adapters, .connection, .core, .requests_ntlm2)",
  "sinks": "None; code only re-exports symbols without processing untrusted data",
  "flows": "None; import statements do not create data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and __all__ declaration",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It performs no data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and structure are typical for a package's __init__.py or module setup. The imported modules may handle sensitive operations, but this snippet only re-exports symbols, which is benign. All reports correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
