{
  "purpose": "The code is used to export and organize various modules related to HTTP NTLM authentication and connection handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .adapters, .connection, .core, .requests_ntlm2",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Imports from modules -> exports via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs module imports and defines an __all__ export list, which is typical for Python package organization. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The imported modules may contain sensitive functionality, but this code itself only re-exports symbols.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module __init__.py or similar file used for organizing exports. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected based on this snippet.",
