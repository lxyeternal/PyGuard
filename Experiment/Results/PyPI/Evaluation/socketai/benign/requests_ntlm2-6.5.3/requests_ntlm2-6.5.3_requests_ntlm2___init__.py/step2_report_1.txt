  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code consists solely of import statements from local modules (.adapters, .connection, .core, .requests_ntlm2) and defines an `__all__` tuple to specify the public API. It performs no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward module export setup.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical flaws:** None observed.\n- **Security flaws:** None observed.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** None; the code is a typical Python module `__init__.py` or similar.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential risks and assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data, does not execute commands, and contains no suspicious patterns.\n- Since the code only re-exports symbols from internal modules, any malicious activity would likely be in those modules, not in this import/export setup.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No further action is needed; the code appears benign and well-understood.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard module export setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
