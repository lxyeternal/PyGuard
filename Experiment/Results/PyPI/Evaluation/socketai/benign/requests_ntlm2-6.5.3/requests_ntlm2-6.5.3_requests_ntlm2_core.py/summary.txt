  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate security utility module for NTLM authentication, TLS certificate handling, and challenge message processing. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk score (0.2) is justified given the socket access pattern, which is standard in certificate retrieval routines. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose."
