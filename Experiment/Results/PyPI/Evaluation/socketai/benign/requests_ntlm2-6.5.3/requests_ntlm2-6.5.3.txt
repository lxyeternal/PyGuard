The low security risk score of 0.2 reflects typical challenges in resource handling but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity and purpose."

The primary security consideration is the debug logging of challenge messages, which should be handled carefully in production environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

The main concern is the global modification of connection classes, which could be exploited if misused, but as implemented, it appears controlled and standard. Overall, the code is benign with a low security risk."
