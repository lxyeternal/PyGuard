  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific implementation for proxy and NTLM support. It does not contain malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the global modification of connection classes, which could be exploited if misused, but as implemented, it appears controlled and standard. Overall, the code is benign with a low security risk."
