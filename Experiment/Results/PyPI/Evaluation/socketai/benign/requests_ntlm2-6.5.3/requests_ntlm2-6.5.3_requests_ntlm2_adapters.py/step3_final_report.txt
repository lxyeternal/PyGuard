  "purpose": "Provides custom HTTP adapters for proxy handling and NTLM authentication, managing headers and connection configurations.",
  "sources": "Request headers (Host, User-Agent), connection parameters (username, password), global connection class modifications.",
  "sinks": "Request headers (Host), global connection class attributes, NTLM credential setting methods.",
  "flows": "Header validation/removal → Connection class configuration → NTLM credential assignment → Global connection class modification.",
  "anomalies": "Global modification of connection classes via pool_classes_by_scheme; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; credential parameters are passed externally.",
  "analysis": "The code manages headers and connection setup for requests with NTLM support, using static methods to modify connection classes globally. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The global class modifications could pose risks if misused but are controlled within the code. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific implementation for proxy and NTLM support. It does not contain malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the global modification of connection classes, which could be exploited if misused, but as implemented, it appears controlled and standard. Overall, the code is benign with a low security risk.",
