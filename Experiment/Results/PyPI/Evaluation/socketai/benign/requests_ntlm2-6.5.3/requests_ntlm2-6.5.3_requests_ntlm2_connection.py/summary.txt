  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of network connection classes supporting NTLM and proxy tunneling. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The overall assessment indicates a safe, standard network handling module."
