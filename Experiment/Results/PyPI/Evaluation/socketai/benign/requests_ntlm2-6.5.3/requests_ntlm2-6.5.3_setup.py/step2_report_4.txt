  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup.py script.\n- No untrusted inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- URLs and version info are hardcoded or derived from static variables.\n- No signs of malware, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes that the code is a standard setup script, reading README.md, setting metadata, no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, confirms static data, no untrusted input.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Repeats the same, standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Zero across the board, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Identifies URL formatting and static data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others, static configuration, no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All 0, as the code is a standard setup script with no security issues.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical, benign `setup.py` script.\n- No signs of supply chain risk, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is safe and standard for package setup.",
