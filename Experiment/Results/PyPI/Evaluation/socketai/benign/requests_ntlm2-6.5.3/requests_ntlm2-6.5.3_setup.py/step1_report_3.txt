{
  "purpose": "The script is used to set up and configure the 'requests_ntlm2' Python package for distribution, including specifying dependencies, metadata, and project details.",
  "sources": "Reads version info, URL, and README.md file for long description; defines requirements list; gathers metadata like author, email, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; it only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code only processes static strings and file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets (beyond typical package metadata), or suspicious logic. The URL for source code and documentation is openly specified. The version string's conditional logic is simple and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It dynamically determines development status based on version string contents. It reads a README file for long description. All dependencies and project URLs are statically assigned or formatted from constants. No untrusted data handling, execution, or code injection is present. The logic and structure are straightforward and typical for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python setup configuration for a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious operations.",
