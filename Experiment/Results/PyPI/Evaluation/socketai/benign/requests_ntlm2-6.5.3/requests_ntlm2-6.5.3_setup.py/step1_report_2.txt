{
  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'requests_ntlm2' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file, defines static strings for version, url, requirements, author details, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting and file operations to generate download URLs, project URLs, and other metadata; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Reads static data (version, URLs, author info), reads README content, and passes this data to the setup() function to prepare the package; no flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets apart from public author email, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no network or system calls with untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily configures package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README file content for long_description and uses string formatting for URLs. No user input or untrusted data is processed. The code appears standard and straightforward for a setup script. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code does not contain any suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script for Python package distribution with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely configures the package metadata and dependencies without processing untrusted data or executing harmful code.",
