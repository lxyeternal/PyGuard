  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup.py configuration script.\n- No untrusted input is processed; URLs and version strings are static or derived internally.\n- No obfuscated code, no suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets beyond standard package metadata.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; setup.py configuration.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- Similar findings: static data, no suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- No untrusted data, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- Uses string formatting with constants, which is safe here.\n- No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Also aligns with the others.\n- No dynamic or untrusted input processing.\n- Standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or risky behaviors, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Note on higher scores:**  \nIf any report had claimed a risk score > 0.5 or indicated potential malicious intent, that would be suspicious. Here, all evidence points to a benign, standard setup script.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis.**",
