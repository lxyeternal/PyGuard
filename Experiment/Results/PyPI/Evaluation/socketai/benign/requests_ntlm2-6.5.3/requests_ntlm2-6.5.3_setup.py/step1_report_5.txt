{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the package 'requests_ntlm2' for distribution, including metadata, requirements, and configuration details.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string, reads the README.md file for long description, and uses hardcoded URLs and author information.",
  "sinks": "Uses format strings to construct URLs, which could potentially include untrusted input, but here they are hardcoded constants.",
  "flows": "The version string influences development status; URLs are constructed directly from constants; no external input flows into sensitive parts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. Usage of format strings with constants is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static configuration for package setup. It reads a version and description, defines requirements, and supplies metadata to setuptools. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are used. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The URLs and email are hardcoded, which is standard in setup scripts. The version check simply assigns a development status string. No unsafe code execution, no backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or execute suspicious code. Overall, it appears safe.",
