{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'requests_ntlm2', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'README.md' file and uses string formatting for URLs and version data.",
  "sinks": "String formatting for 'download_url' and 'project_urls' could potentially be manipulated if the variables are tampered with, but they are hardcoded or derived internally; no untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; dependencies and metadata are static or predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up package metadata using static values and reads a README file for the long description. The URL and version are hardcoded, with no user input involved. The formatting of URLs and version strings does not introduce risks. There is no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no use of untrusted inputs or potentially malicious code. The code follows standard Python package setup conventions without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
