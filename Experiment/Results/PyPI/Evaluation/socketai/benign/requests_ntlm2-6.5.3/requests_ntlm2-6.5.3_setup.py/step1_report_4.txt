{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'requests_ntlm2' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads version information, long description from README.md, and constructs URLs and requirements.",
  "sinks": "Uses formatted strings to generate download URLs and tracker URLs based on version and URL variables.",
  "flows": "Reads version and URL variables; constructs URL strings; reads README.md content; passes all data to setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Use of string formatting for URLs is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration script. It reads a version number and a URL, dynamically generates URLs for download and issue tracker, and reads README.md for long description. No malicious payload, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code handles dependencies and package metadata securely. No signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The use of string formatting for URL construction is benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It properly manages dependencies and package metadata without suspicious or harmful code.",
