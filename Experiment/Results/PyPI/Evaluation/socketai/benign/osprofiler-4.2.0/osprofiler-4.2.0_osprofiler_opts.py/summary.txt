  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration module for profiling in OpenStack. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only security consideration is the default 'SECRET_KEY', which should be replaced in deployment. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
