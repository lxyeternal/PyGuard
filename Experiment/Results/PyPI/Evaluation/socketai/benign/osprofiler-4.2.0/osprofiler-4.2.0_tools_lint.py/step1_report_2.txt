  "purpose": "The script runs pylint on a specified directory to perform static code analysis with specific enabled warning messages.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] (user-provided directory path)",
  "sinks": "lint.Run() (executes pylint with specified options)",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1] -> main() -> lint.Run()",
  "anomalies": "None observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and pylint, then defines a list of pylint message IDs to enable. The main() function constructs a pylint command with specific options to disable all messages except for W0611, and runs pylint on the provided directory path. The script is invoked with a command-line argument specifying the directory to analyze. No user input is sanitized beyond passing directly to pylint. The code appears to perform a standard static analysis process without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no obfuscation techniques or hidden functionalities detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward static analysis tool wrapper for pylint, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or supply chain attacks.",
