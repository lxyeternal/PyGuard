  "sources": "sys.argv[1] (directory path input)",
  "sinks": "Passing directory path directly to pylint via lint.Run()",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1] -> lint.Run() with constructed command-line options",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; direct use of user input without sanitization but acceptable in context",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, constructs pylint command options to enable specific warning messages, and executes pylint on a user-specified directory. It does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and functions as a static analysis wrapper. The user input is passed directly to pylint, which is typical for such scripts; no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for static analysis with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
