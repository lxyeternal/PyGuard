  "purpose": "Run pylint static analysis on a specified directory with specific enabled warning messages.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] - command-line argument input specifying directory path",
  "sinks": "lint.Run() function executing with command-line options, potentially executing pylint with user-specified directory",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> main() -> lint.Run() with directory path and options",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of pylint library is standard for code analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and pylint modules to perform static code analysis on a user-specified directory. It constructs pylint command options to enable specific warning messages and disable others, then executes pylint via lint.Run(). The script uses command-line arguments to determine target directory. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The code simply acts as a wrapper around pylint with predefined options.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to run pylint analysis with specific configuration. There is no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate, benign script intended for code quality checks.",
