  "sources": "Imports os and sys modules, and accesses environment variables indirectly through os.path.abspath.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points identified.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical setup for documentation. It imports standard modules, extends sys.path, and sets up configuration variables for documentation generation. No malicious logic, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears purely for configuration purposes without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for documentation generation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
