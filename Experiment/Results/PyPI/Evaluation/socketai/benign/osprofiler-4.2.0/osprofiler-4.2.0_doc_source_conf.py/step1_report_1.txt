  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation with Sphinx for the OSprofiler project.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, filesystem paths, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; configuration data is static or derived from safe sources.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; mainly static configuration assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration script. It imports os and sys modules to set up paths, specifies extensions, themes, and output options. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is purely declarative and static, serving only configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard documentation build configuration file with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks.",
