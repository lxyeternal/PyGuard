  "purpose": "This code serves as a configuration file for building documentation with Sphinx, setting up extensions, paths, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os' and 'sys', modifies 'sys.path', and sets configuration variables for Sphinx.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration with no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "None; all assignments are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script, importing common modules, extending sys.path, and setting documentation build options. It contains no dynamic behavior, external calls, or untrusted input handling. The code is static, straightforward, and aligns with typical usage. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate benign, well-understood configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0 are appropriate and justified.",
