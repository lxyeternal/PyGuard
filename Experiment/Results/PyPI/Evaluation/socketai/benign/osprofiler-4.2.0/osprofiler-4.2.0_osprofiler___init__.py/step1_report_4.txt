  "purpose": "Retrieve and expose the version of the 'osprofiler' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('osprofiler')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code reads the package version and assigns it to __version__, with no further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; simple package metadata retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimalistic Python module that imports 'importlib.metadata' and assigns the version of 'osprofiler' to __version__. It includes licensing comments but no other logic. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no output beyond the version string. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves to define a package version and does not contain malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe package metadata access.",
