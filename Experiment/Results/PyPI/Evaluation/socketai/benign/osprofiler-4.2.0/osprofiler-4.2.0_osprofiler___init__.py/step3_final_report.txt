  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'osprofiler' package using Python's importlib.metadata module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via importlib.metadata.version('osprofiler').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static retrieval of package metadata.",
  "flows": "Import of importlib.metadata -> call to version('osprofiler') -> assignment to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and retrieves the version of 'osprofiler', assigning it to __version__. It performs a benign, read-only operation with no user input, network activity, or data leaks. The code is minimal, standard, and contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The license comments are boilerplate and do not influence runtime behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for retrieving package version information with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
