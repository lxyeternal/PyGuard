  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('osprofiler')",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being outputted or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard for obtaining package version information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and calls its version() function with 'osprofiler' as the argument. This is a straightforward operation to get the package version. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The license comments are standard boilerplate, and the code structure is simple and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of retrieving package version information without any malicious intent or security risks.",
