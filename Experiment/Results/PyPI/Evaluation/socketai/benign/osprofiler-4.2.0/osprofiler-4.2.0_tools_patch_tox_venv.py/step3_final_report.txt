  "purpose": "Setup utility for creating and configuring a Python virtual environment with dependencies, delegating post-processing to an external module.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'VIRTUAL_ENV', locating requirement files, importing external module 'install_venv'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'install.post_process()' which may execute arbitrary code within the external module.",
  "flows": "From environment variable 'VIRTUAL_ENV' and file path checks to invoking 'install_venv.InstallVenv' and its 'post_process()' method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable without validation, reliance on external module with unknown implementation, no input sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: locating requirement files, reading environment variables, and invoking an external module to handle virtual environment setup. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. The main concern is the external 'install_venv' module's 'post_process()' method, which could contain malicious behavior, but this cannot be assessed here. The use of 'VIRTUAL_ENV' without validation is typical but could be exploited if environment is compromised. The code is straightforward and obfuscated is not present. Given the lack of direct malicious activity, the malware score is 0. The reliance on external code justifies a low security risk score of 0.2, reflecting minimal but notable uncertainty due to external dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup utility with no embedded malicious code. The primary security concern lies in the external 'install_venv' module's 'post_process()' method, which could execute malicious actions if compromised. The current scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. It is recommended to verify the trustworthiness of the external module before deployment in sensitive environments.",
