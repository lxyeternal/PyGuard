  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - The code defines four custom exception classes: `CommandError`, `LogInsightAPIError`, and `LogInsightLoginTimeout`.\n   - The only dynamic behavior is in `CommandError`, which accepts a message during initialization and provides a string representation.\n   - The other classes are simple subclasses of `Exception` with no additional logic.\n   - There are no external data reads, no network or file I/O, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious or malicious code.\n\n2. **Assessment of Maliciousness & Risks:**\n   - The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or malware.\n   - No external communication, data exfiltration, or dangerous operations.\n   - The exception classes are benign and serve typical error handling purposes.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of risky behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they recognize this as benign, straightforward code.\n   - The only point to consider is the `CommandError` class, which allows setting a message. This is standard and not suspicious.\n   - No reason to increase the scores for malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Personal Estimate:**\n   - Based on the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n   - The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n   - **My estimated scores:**\n     - **Malware:** 0\n     - **Obfuscated:** 0\n     - **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final Note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No changes are necessary. The code is a typical, benign exception class definition with no security concerns.",
