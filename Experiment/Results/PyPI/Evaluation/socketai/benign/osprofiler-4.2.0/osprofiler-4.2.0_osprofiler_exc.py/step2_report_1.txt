  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines four custom exception classes:\n     - `CommandError` with an optional message attribute and a custom `__str__` method.\n     - `LogInsightAPIError`\n     - `LogInsightLoginTimeout`\n   - All classes inherit from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external input/output, or network interactions.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic.\n   - No external communication, data leaks, or code injections.\n   - Exception classes are standard and serve typical error handling purposes.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the code as standard, benign, and free of malicious intent.\n   - The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n4. **Consistency & Scoring Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores accurately reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no external interactions, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The malware score is 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no indication of code obfuscation.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The reported scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
