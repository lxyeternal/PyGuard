  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, particularly the __init__ method in CommandError that accepts a message.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, with CommandError including an optional message and a custom __str__ method. The other two are simple subclasses of Exception. The code is standard, with no external data input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception classes serve typical error handling purposes, and the code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
