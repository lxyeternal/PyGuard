  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines four custom exception classes: `CommandError`, `LogInsightAPIError`, and `LogInsightLoginTimeout`.\n   - The `CommandError` class has an `__init__` method that assigns a message and a `__str__` method for string representation.\n   - The other two classes are simple subclasses of `Exception` with no additional logic.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external input/output, no data processing, and no network or file operations.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no code injections, and no suspicious behavior are evident.\n   - The code appears to be a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and no anomalies are identified.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate given the absence of any malicious or suspicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The risk score is 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues or inconsistencies are found. The code is simple, and the reports are accurate.\n   - The only minor note is that the `CommandError` class has a message attribute and custom `__str__`, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - There is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, benign implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.",
