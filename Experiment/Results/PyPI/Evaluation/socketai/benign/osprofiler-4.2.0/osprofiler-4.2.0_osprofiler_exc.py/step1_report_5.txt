  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for CLI errors and LogInsight API errors.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method in CommandError allows setting a message, but nothing suspicious or unusual. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for exceptions with minimal logic. The CommandError class allows setting a message, which is typical for custom exceptions. No input/output handling, external data sources, or dangerous code constructs are present. The other exception classes are empty, serving as placeholders. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be standard error handling code, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
