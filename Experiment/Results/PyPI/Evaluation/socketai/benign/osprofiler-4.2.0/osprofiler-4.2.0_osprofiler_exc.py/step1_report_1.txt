{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a CLI tool and API interactions.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs within the code).",
  "sinks": "None (no output, data leak, or external communication is performed).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow occurs as there are no sources or sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward exception class definitions with standard Python syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. The CommandError class includes a message attribute and custom __str__ method, but no external input handling or risky behavior. Other classes are simple and contain no logic or external interactions. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and benign implementation of custom exception classes with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
