  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with `CommandError` having an `__init__` and `__str__` method, and the other two being empty subclasses.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. They do not identify any logical flaws or security issues.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - No errors or questionable claims are present in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external data handling, no network communication, and no malicious logic, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The current scores are justified and consistent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - No malicious activity is detected or suggested.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks are evident in this code snippet.\n\n### **Summary**:\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: No changes needed; all scores and assessments are justified.",
