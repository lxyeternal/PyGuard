  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for CLI errors and LogInsight API interactions.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only class definitions with no input or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard exception class definitions and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with no data processing, input/output, or external communication. The only dynamic aspect is the __init__ method of CommandError, which assigns a message. There are no hardcoded credentials, code injections, or suspicious operations. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and appears to be standard exception class definitions without malicious intent or security risks.",
