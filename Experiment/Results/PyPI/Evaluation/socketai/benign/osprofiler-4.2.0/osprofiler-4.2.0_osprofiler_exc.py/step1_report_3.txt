  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to command usage and LogInsight API issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent or written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no unusual or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception class definitions. One class (`CommandError`) includes an initializer that assigns a message and a string representation method. The other two classes (`LogInsightAPIError` and `LogInsightLoginTimeout`) are empty subclasses of `Exception`. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks, no data flows, and no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard, harmless component for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes for error handling purposes, with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is a typical pattern used in Python applications for error management.",
