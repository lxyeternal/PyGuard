  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a CLI or API context.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only raises and defines exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, malicious logic, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes: CommandError with a message parameter, and LogInsightAPIError and LogInsightLoginTimeout as simple exception subclasses. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no code injection points, or network interactions. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions intended for error handling in an application. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward definition of custom exceptions with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be safe and standard for its purpose.",
