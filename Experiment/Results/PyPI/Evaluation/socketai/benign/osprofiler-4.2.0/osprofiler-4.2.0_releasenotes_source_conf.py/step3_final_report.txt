{
  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation, setting parameters and options for the documentation build process.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static variable assignments and comments within the configuration file itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code does not handle external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration file containing variable assignments, comments, and import statements for local modules. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or dynamic code. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, aligning with the benign, declarative nature of the script. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited. The reports correctly identify the code as safe and free of malicious intent, with consistent scoring and reasoning. Given the static, non-executable nature, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All assessments and scores are appropriate, indicating no security threat or malware risk.",
