  "sources": "Reading configuration values from the script itself, including extension lists, paths, and project metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are set within the script, with no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code is standard configuration for documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It includes typical metadata, extension lists, and theme options, all of which are standard and do not contain any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or malicious payloads. There are no signs of obfuscated code, network operations, or credential management. The code is purely declarative, setting parameters for documentation rendering.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file for documentation purposes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The code is well-structured, and all components are standard for Sphinx setup. Overall security risk and malware likelihood are extremely low.",
