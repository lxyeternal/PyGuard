  "purpose": "Utilities for string manipulation, singleton pattern, safe temporary file creation, and dynamic function creation.",
  "sources": "User input via function parameters such as 'string', 'callback', and 'options'. Environment variables are not directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write to external systems, network, or filesystem directly with untrusted data. The tempfile creation may involve untrusted parameters, but it uses secure methods.",
  "flows": "N/A – the functions process data internally without external data flow pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The create_function utility dynamically constructs functions, which could potentially be misused if used maliciously, but the code itself is standard. The get_secure_filename function creates and immediately closes a temporary file without any suspicious handling. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'indent' for XML element indentation, 'get_secure_filename' for secure temporary filename generation, 'Singleton' metaclass implementing singleton pattern, 'create_function' for dynamic function composition, and 'substitute' for string placeholder replacement. These are straightforward implementations without malicious intent. No network or file system exploits are evident; 'tempfile.mkstemp' is used securely. 'create_function' dynamically constructs functions but does so in a standard manner; misuse depends on user input, not on internal malicious code. The code avoids any suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. Overall, the code appears benign, designed for utility rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard Python techniques and secure practices. While 'create_function' allows dynamic code creation, its implementation is straightforward and not inherently malicious. There are no indicators of malware or security risks within this code fragment.",
