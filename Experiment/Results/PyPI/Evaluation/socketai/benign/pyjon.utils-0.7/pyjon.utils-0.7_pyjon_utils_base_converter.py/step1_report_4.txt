{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert numbers between different bases, supporting custom numerals for bases higher than 36.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments: 'num' (string), 'base_from' (int), 'base_to' (int), and optional 'numerals' strings.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the use of 'int(num, base_from)' which converts the input string to an integer, potentially susceptible if 'num' is crafted maliciously, but standard 'int' parsing is safe in Python. No network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'num' is parsed via 'int(num, base_from)', then processed in 'decimal_to_n' or returned as string in 'n_to_m'. No external data is sent or received.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward numeric base conversion logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The numerals argument allows for customization, but this is typical for such functions.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform numeric base conversions with standard Python operations. Input validation ensures 'base_from' and 'base_to' are within reasonable ranges. The recursion in 'decimal_to_n' is safe for valid inputs. No external calls, network activity, or file operations are present. The code is well-documented and uses common techniques for base conversion. No malicious behavior or sabotage indications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of base conversion functions with input validation. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The functions are safe, predictable, and suitable for numeric conversions.",
