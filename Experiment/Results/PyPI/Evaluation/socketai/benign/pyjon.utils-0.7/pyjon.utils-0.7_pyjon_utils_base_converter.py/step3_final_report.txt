  "purpose": "Number base conversion utility supporting arbitrary bases and custom numerals, handling negatives.",
  "sources": "Input string 'num' for n_to_m; integer 'num' for decimal_to_n.",
  "sinks": "Return strings representing converted numbers; no external system calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input string parsed via int() in n_to_m; recursion in decimal_to_n; output concatenation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no malicious code, standard validation present, no secrets or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard base conversions using Python's int() and recursion. No external system calls or malicious patterns are present. Input validation ensures bases are within valid ranges. Use of int() on untrusted input could raise exceptions but does not execute code or leak data. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard number base conversion utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
