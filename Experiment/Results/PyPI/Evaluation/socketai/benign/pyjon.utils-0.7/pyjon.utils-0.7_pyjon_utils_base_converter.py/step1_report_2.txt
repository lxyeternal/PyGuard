{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert numbers between different bases, supporting arbitrary numeral sets and including usage examples.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: 'num', 'base_from', 'base_to', and optional 'numerals' strings.",
  "sinks": "The only data output is the return value of functions, which are strings representing numbers in different bases; no external data sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed: 'num' is converted from string to int in 'n_to_m', then passed to 'decimal_to_n' for further conversion; no external data flows or untrusted data handling outside parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard number base conversions with proper validation for bases. No external data sources, network operations, or side effects are present. It relies solely on standard Python functions, such as int() for conversion from string to integer, which is safe. Usage examples are illustrative. No malicious intent or malicious payloads are detectable. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward utility module with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign number base conversion utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely converts numbers between arbitrary bases and uses standard Python functions. There are no anomalies or suspicious elements present.",
