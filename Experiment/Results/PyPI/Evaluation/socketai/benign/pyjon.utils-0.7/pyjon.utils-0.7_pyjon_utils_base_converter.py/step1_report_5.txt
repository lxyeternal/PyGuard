{
  "purpose": "Convert numbers between different bases, supporting custom numerals and arbitrary bases.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'num', 'base_from', 'base_to', 'numerals', and function calls to int() with untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Conversion results returned as strings; no direct data leaks or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed, converted via int() and recursive functions, then output as strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of int() for base conversion is standard; no unsafe code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides number base conversion functions with support for custom numerals. It performs input validation on bases, handles negative numbers, and uses recursion for conversion. The use of int() with untrusted input could potentially lead to exceptions, but this is expected for input parsing. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior; it appears to be a standard utility module for base conversions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign number base conversion utility with no signs of malicious intent. It processes input safely and provides expected output without side effects.",
