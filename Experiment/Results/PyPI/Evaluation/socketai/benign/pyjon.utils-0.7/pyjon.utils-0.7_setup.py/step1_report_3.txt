{
  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution of the 'pyjon.utils' Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Read from 'README.rst' file for long_description, hardcoded string for version, package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file writes, or environment variables are present.",
  "flows": "Input from the 'README.rst' file flows into the 'long_description' parameter; no other significant data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read a file directly for long_description; no validation or error handling for file access. No other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads a local README file for description, specifies metadata, and uses 'find_packages' to discover modules. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input are present. The only potential concern is reading the README file without exception handling, which is benign in the context of package setup. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical and benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
