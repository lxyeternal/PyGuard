  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'pyjon.utils' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the long_description from 'README.rst'; no other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file system, or environment variables are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink is identifiable as potentially malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be a standard package setup script. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, sets a version, and calls setup() with typical package metadata and configuration. It reads the long description from a file but does not evaluate or execute any external or untrusted code. The package dependencies are standard, and no custom code execution or network activity is evident. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup and contains no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
