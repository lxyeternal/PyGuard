  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'pyjon.utils' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the long_description from 'README.rst', defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.rst' -> Define setup parameters -> Package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read a file without error handling, but no malicious activity; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the long_description from a local file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No suspicious code, external network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The use of open() without error handling is typical but not malicious. Overall, the script functions solely to define package installation parameters with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks only.",
