  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'pyjon.utils' library, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling",
  "flows": "Reads local file; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The only operation is reading a local README file, which is standard practice. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. Minor concern about lack of error handling in open() is not security-related and does not impact the overall benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
