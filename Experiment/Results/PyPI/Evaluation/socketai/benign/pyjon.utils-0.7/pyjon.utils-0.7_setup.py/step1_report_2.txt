{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pyjon.utils' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file writing, or execution points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' → package setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The 'long_description' reads a file without sanitization, but this is typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' for package configuration, reads a description file, and defines package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no reading of untrusted input, and no network or system manipulation code are present. All elements follow standard packaging practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for package distribution, with no malicious behavior detected. It contains no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The script is safe and purely for packaging purposes.",
