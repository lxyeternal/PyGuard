{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'pyjon.utils' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long_description; no other data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written or transmitted outside the package setup process.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a file without validation or sanitization is standard in setup scripts; no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines version, and calls setup() with package metadata and requirements. It reads a README file for description, specifies package info, classifiers, dependencies, and entry points. All components are typical for package distribution and do not involve external data processing, code execution, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely facilitates package installation and distribution.",
