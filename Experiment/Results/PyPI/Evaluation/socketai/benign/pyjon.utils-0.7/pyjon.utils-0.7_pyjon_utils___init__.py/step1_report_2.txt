  "purpose": "Import utility functions and classes from the pyjon.utils.main module, likely for use in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing specific functions and classes from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic present; only imports are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the code only imports functions and classes without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the 'pyjon.utils.main' module, including functions for filename security, singleton pattern implementation, function creation, substitution, and indentation. No executable logic, data handling, or untrusted input sources are present. Without additional code, it appears to be standard import statements with no malicious intent or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import of utility functions and classes. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks based on this limited view.",
