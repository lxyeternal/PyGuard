  "purpose": "Import utility functions and classes from the pyjon.utils.main module for use in the larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports functions/classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks are present; no sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing utility functions and classes. No executable logic, data processing, or external communication occurs. The imported functions are typical utility components, indicating benign intent. The code shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident, and the code does not pose any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
