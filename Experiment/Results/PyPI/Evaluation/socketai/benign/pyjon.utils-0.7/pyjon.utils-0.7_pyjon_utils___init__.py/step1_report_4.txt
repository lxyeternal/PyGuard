  "purpose": "Import utility functions and classes from the pyjon.utils.main module for general utility purposes in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the module 'pyjon.utils.main', which likely source functions and classes from the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; the code only contains import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing are present in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are evident in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement, importing specific functions and classes from a module within the pyjon package. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity can be inferred solely from import statements. It does not contain any execution or data handling logic, making it inherently safe but limited in scope for comprehensive security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger program, and on its own, it does not pose any security risks.",
