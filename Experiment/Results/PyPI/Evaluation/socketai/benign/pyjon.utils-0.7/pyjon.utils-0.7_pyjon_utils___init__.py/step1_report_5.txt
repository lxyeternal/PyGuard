  "purpose": "Import utility functions and classes from the pyjon.utils.main module",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions and classes: get_secure_filename, Singleton, create_function, substitute, indent",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute commands; solely importing functions/classes",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as only imports are shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code only performs imports from a specific module, which is typical in Python scripts for modularity. No executable logic, input handling, or data processing is present that could be exploited or malicious. The imported functions and classes appear to be utility functions, possibly for filename handling, singleton pattern implementation, code creation, string substitution, and indentation, all of which are common and benign in themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No suspicious or malicious activity can be determined from these imports alone.",
