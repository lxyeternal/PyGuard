  "purpose": "Import utility functions and classes from the 'pyjon.utils.main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions and classes from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink identified; the code only imports components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the import appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a presumably internal or external utility module. No execution of untrusted input, no hardcoded secrets, nor any dynamic code execution present. The imported functions and classes suggest utility purposes, and there is no indication of malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs detected. The overall code is minimal and standard for modular Python programs.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger program where these utilities are used. No security concerns or malware detected.",
