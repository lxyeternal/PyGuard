  "sources": "Import and call declare_namespace from pkg_resources, fallback to extend_path from pkgutil",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output modification",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only manages package namespace setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for optional import is common; no suspicious variables or logic",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using setuptools' pkg_resources. If that module is unavailable, it falls back to extending __path__ with extend_path from pkgutil. Both actions are standard for Python namespace packages. No user input, network activity, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets are detected. The fallback mechanism is typical for compatibility and does not introduce risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard boilerplate for namespace package declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
