  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package in Python, ensuring compatibility whether pkg_resources is available or not.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' to call 'declare_namespace' or falling back to 'pkgutil.extend_path' to modify '__path__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks, network calls, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Importing module -> attempting to declare namespace -> fallback to extend '__path__' if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard boilerplate code with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a common pattern for namespace package declaration, using a try-except block to ensure compatibility. It involves no user input, network activity, or malicious code. The fallback mechanism is standard and safe. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-understood, and widely used in open source projects. No vulnerabilities or security risks are introduced by this pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for namespace declaration, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify it as safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
