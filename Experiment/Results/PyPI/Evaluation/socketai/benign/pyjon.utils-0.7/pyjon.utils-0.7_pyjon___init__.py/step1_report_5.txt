  "purpose": "Declare namespace packages for setuptools compatibility",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' to declare namespace, fallback to 'pkgutil.extend_path' if ImportError occurs",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply declares namespace packages",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard pattern for namespace package declaration, no suspicious or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using 'pkg_resources'. If 'pkg_resources' is not available, it falls back to extending '__path__' with 'pkgutil.extend_path'. Both steps are common in Python packaging for namespace packages. No user input, environment variables, or external data is processed. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard boilerplate for namespace package declaration in Python and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
