  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a general Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, imported modules, and any input functions (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands executed via subprocess or os.system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file system, possibly passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are detected. Lack of explicit malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly, including imports, function definitions, control flow, and data handling. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or system damage, were observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic execution patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk score is low. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the clarity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
