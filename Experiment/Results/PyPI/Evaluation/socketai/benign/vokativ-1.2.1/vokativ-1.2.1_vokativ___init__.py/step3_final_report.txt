{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions 'vokativ' and 'sex' from a local module and sets a version string, serving as a module initialization or version declaration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.vokativ), assignment of __version__ string",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Import from local module (source) to functions/variables used within the module; no external data flow or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a relative import from a local module and defining a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The import is standard practice in Python packages, assuming the local module exists and is legitimate. No data flows, network activity, or external inputs are present. The code's simplicity and benign nature are confirmed by the absence of anomalies or suspicious patterns. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and justified. The confidence score is 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
