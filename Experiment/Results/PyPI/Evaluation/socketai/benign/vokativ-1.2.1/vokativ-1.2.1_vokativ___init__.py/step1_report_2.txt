{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or variables from a module named 'vokativ' and sets a version string for the current module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.vokativ', which reads data from the 'vokativ' module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local module 'vokativ' to the current module via import; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and a version string assignment. The import is from a relative module, which is standard Python practice. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. No external network activity, data leakage, or suspicious operations are present. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of module importation and versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical module import and version declaration.",
