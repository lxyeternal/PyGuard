{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the version of a module and imports specific functions or variables from a submodule named 'vokativ'.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .vokativ import vokativ, sex' reads from a local module or package named 'vokativ'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system commands in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local 'vokativ' module to this module via the import statement; no further untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement and version assignment are standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard, importing specific components from a local module and setting a version string. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The presence of a local import does not inherently indicate malicious intent, especially given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. It simply sets a version and imports local components.",
