  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: it imports from a local module (`.vokativ`) and assigns a version string.\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are detected.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score here is 0, which is justified.\n   - The code is benign; no security risk exists.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, payload, or suspicious behavior is detected, malware score = 0 is appropriate.\n   - The code only imports a local module and sets a version string.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They focus on the code's observable behavior, which is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the findings.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe code snippet is a minimal, standard module import and version declaration, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I agree with the current scores.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
