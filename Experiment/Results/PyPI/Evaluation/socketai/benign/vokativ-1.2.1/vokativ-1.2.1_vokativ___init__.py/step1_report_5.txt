  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from a local module named 'vokativ'. No other functionality or behavior is evident from this snippet.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.vokativ' module",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import is static, no runtime data flow occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement from a local module and a version string declaration. There are no functions, no data processing, no I/O operations, and no suspicious behavior. The import is relative, indicating local module usage, which is common and benign. The version string is also standard and does not pose any security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module import with a version identifier, containing no malicious intent or security risks.",
