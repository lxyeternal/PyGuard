  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of a relative import from a local module 'vokativ' and a version string assignment.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external network activity are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The import statements are standard Python practices, referencing local modules.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports agree on the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n- The purpose is purely to import functions/variables and set a version string.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate given the evidence.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or claims to challenge:**\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.\n- The import from a local module 'vokativ' does not inherently pose a security risk unless the module itself is malicious, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or I/O operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The current scoring (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) is accurate and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe code is a standard module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.",
