  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from a local module named 'vokativ' and define a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'vokativ' for 'vokativ' and 'sex', and defines a string '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data output or network actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures. The import and version assignment are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing components from a local module and setting a version. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with straightforward imports and a version string assignment. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
