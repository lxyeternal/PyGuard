{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python unittest suite testing functions 'vokativ' and 'sex' with external test data files.",
  "sources": "Reading test data files in '_get_tests' method, input parameters to 'vokativ' and 'sex' functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data effects or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Test data read from files flows into assertions; function calls use input data; results compared with expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward file reading and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing: it reads test cases from external files, calls 'vokativ' and 'sex', and asserts expected results. No network, system modifications, or data leaks are present. The functions are imported, presumed benign. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code structure is clear, and the logic is sound. The test data files are external and not shown, but their usage here is safe. Overall, the code appears benign and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe unit testing script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions under test are presumed benign, and no vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
