  "purpose": "Unit tests for the vokativ and sex functions, verifying correct behavior with various input names.",
  "sources": "Reading test case data from files ('man_first_name_tests', 'man_last_name_tests', etc.) using open().",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is processed into sensitive operations; no network, file write, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Input data read from files is used in assertions; no untrusted data flow to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard unit testing practices observed. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unittest implementation verifying functions 'vokativ' and 'sex'. It reads test data from files and performs assertions. There are no operations that involve data leaks, network activity, or modification of system state. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The imports are common, and the code structure is straightforward. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for name processing functions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
