{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'vokativ' and 'sex' functions, which likely perform linguistic transformations and gender detection on names.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from test files 'man_first_name_tests', 'man_last_name_tests', 'woman_first_name_tests', 'woman_last_name_tests' located in the same directory as this script.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions; the code primarily reads files and calls functions, with no network, file system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data from test files flows into 'vokativ' and 'sex' functions for testing purposes; no data flows into sensitive sinks such as network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, performing standard file reading and unit testing. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and the 'vokativ' and 'sex' functions, then defines a test class that loads test cases from files. The tests verify correctness and data types. There are no suspicious operations, no dynamic code execution, or external communication. The code appears to be legitimate test code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for linguistic functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It reads test data from files and performs assertions, all within normal testing practices.",
