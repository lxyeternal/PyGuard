  "purpose": "Unit testing suite for the vokativ and sex functions, verifying their correctness with various input scenarios.",
  "sources": "File input from 'man_first_name_tests', 'man_last_name_tests', 'woman_first_name_tests', and 'woman_last_name_tests'. No other data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "The only notable sink is file reading with open() and decoding, which processes external test data. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input files are read and decoded, then passed into vokativ and sex functions; results are compared but no data flows into other system components or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Use of standard library functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unittest module that reads test cases from external files, then tests the vokativ and sex functions. It includes basic input validation tests and does not process or transmit data beyond local file reading. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The functions tested are assumed to be legitimate based on the context. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing script with no malicious intent or malicious code patterns. It reads test data from files, executes tests, and verifies function outputs. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
