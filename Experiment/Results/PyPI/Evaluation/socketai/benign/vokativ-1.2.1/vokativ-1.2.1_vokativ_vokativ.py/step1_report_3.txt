  "purpose": "A class for generating vocative forms of Polish names based on gender and suffixes, using data loaded from files.",
  "sources": "Reads data from files 'man_suffixes', 'man_vs_woman_suffixes', and 'woman_first_vs_last_name_suffixes' located in a data directory; reads input parameters such as 'name', 'woman', and 'last_name'.",
  "sinks": "Uses pickle.load to deserialize data from files; no direct network or system calls; no handling of untrusted input beyond input validation for 'name'.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' is validated and transformed; file data is loaded lazily and cached; suffix matching is performed on 'name'; no untrusted data flows into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle.load on local data files; no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads; code structure is straightforward with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that loads suffix data from local pickle files to process names and generate vocative forms. It performs input validation on 'name' to ensure it is a string. Data is loaded lazily using pickle.load from files located in a data directory relative to the script. The suffix matching logic searches from longest to shortest suffixes. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior or anomalies like hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors. The use of pickle for local data loading appears safe, assuming data files are trustworthy. Overall, the code seems to serve a linguistic purpose with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a name processing utility that loads suffix data from local pickle files and performs string manipulations. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The use of pickle is acceptable in this context, assuming data files are secure. The overall security risk is low, and no malware is evident.",
