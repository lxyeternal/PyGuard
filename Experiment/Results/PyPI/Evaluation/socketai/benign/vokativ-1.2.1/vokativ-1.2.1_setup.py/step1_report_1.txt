  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'vokativ' that handles declension of Czech names into vocative case.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing setup functions from external modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> executing setup() with package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. Use of standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading a README file, and calling setup() with package metadata. No obfuscated code, no network activity, and no handling of user input or untrusted data. All imports are from standard or well-known sources, and no malicious functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads a README file for documentation and calls setup() with static package info. No anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
