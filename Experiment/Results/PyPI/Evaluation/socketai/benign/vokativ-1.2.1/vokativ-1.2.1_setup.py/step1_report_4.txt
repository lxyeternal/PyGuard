  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'vokativ' Python module, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; importing setup functions from setuptools or distutils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network or data transmission occurring.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into the setup configuration as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports setup from setuptools or distutils, then reads 'README.md' with utf-8 encoding for description. It proceeds to call setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No untrusted input processing, dynamic code execution, or external network interactions are present. The code is standard for Python package setup and contains no suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
