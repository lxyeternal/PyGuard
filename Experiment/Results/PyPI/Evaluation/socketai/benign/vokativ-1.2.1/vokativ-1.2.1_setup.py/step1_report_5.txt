  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'vokativ'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reading file 'README.md' and passing its content to setup() as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that attempts to import setuptools for package setup, falls back to distutils if necessary, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no sources of untrusted data beyond the benign reading of a local file. The code uses common patterns for package distribution and does not contain any suspicious logic, malicious code, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal setup script for packaging a Python library with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
