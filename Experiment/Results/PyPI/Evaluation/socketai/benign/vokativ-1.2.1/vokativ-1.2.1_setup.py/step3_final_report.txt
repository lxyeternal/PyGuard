  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'vokativ', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file and calls setup() with static data; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup configuration with no dynamic or malicious operations. It reads a local README file, which is standard, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. No network activity, no untrusted input, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight 'securityRisk' score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified given the benign code, and should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard Python package setup file with no malicious or security concerns. All evidence points to a benign configuration, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
