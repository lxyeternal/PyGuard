{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package named 'vokativ' for distribution, including reading a README file and specifying package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description and imports setup functions from setuptools or distutils.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or any actions that would lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading the README.md file content and passing package metadata to the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code follows a typical package setup pattern without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a try-except block to import 'setup' from 'setuptools' or 'distutils.core' as fallback. It then reads the 'README.md' file with utf-8 encoding to obtain the long description. The setup() function is called with package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URL, keywords, packages, dependencies, license, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python package distribution scripts, with no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
