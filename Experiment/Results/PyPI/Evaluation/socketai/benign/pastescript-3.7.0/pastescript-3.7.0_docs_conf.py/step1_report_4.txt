  "purpose": "Configuration file for Sphinx documentation build system.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, module imports (commented out), and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present; static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The code appears to be standard configuration for Sphinx documentation, with no dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with commented instructions and variable assignments controlling documentation build options. No input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. All parameters are static and related to documentation formatting, theme, extensions, and paths. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The only concern could be if malicious actors modify the configuration to include harmful extensions or scripts, but as provided, it contains no such elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for documentation build configuration.",
