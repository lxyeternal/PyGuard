  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. All code appears standard for a configuration file.",
  "analysis": "This file is a standard Sphinx configuration script with comments and straightforward assignments. It does not perform any dynamic operations, data processing, or external communications. There are no hardcoded credentials, code injection points, or obfuscated elements. The structure is typical for documentation build settings, and it contains only static configuration parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely declarative, serving to configure documentation generation. No suspicious or malicious behavior was detected.",
