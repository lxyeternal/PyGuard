{
  "purpose": "This code sets up and runs a CherryPy WSGI server with optional SSL support.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (cherrypy, ssl), reads input parameters (host, port, ssl_pem, protocol_version, etc.), and user-provided app callable.",
  "sinks": "Network socket binding (server start), SSL configuration, print statements for server info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into server configuration (host, port, SSL setup). SSL files (ssl_pem) influence SSL configuration. The server is started, which binds to network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or backdoors. SSL setup uses external files provided via parameters without validation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. Print statements only output server info.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes and runs a WSGI server with optional SSL configuration. It reads configuration parameters and sets up the server accordingly. SSL certificates are provided via external files; no embedded secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The SSL setup is standard, and no suspicious network behavior or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic. It does not perform any data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity. The only potential concern is reliance on external SSL files, but this is a common pattern and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CherryPy WSGI server setup with SSL support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate server configuration code with no malicious intent.",
