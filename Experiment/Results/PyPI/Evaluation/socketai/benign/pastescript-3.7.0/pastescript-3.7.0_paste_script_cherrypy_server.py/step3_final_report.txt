{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and runs a CherryPy WSGI server with optional SSL support, configuring server parameters and handling SSL certificates if provided.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'ssl_pem', 'host', 'port', and configuration variables like 'numthreads', 'timeout'.",
  "sinks": "Server start method, SSL configuration setup, and print statements indicating server status.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'ssl_pem') influence SSL setup; server initialization leads to server.start(), which begins listening for connections.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. SSL setup relies on external files, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward server setup script, with standard SSL handling and server configuration. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The SSL files are external and could be misused if supplied from untrusted sources, but this is outside the code's scope. The print statements are informational. The server parameters are typical, and the code does not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CherryPy WSGI server setup with optional SSL support. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
