  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard namespace package setup, with no malicious activity. It gracefully handles missing modules and uses common patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also describes standard namespace setup, no suspicious code or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The security risk score of 0 aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, standard package initialization, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes necessary.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard namespace package code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The slight risk score reflects minimal concern, which is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard package setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The zero risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk. Given the benign nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is boilerplate for namespace package setup, with proper error handling and optional module usage. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n- The scores are aligned with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (fully benign, no security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and does not warrant any concern. The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
