  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard namespace package setup code, handling optional dependencies gracefully. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature. The securityRisk is low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Justification:** The code is typical for package initialization; no signs of malicious intent. The low securityRisk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, this is boilerplate namespace package setup code with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with benign code.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard namespace declaration and path extension with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent; the code is typical package setup.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard package initialization code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, given the code's benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The slight securityRisk reflects the use of optional modules and path extension, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard namespace setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1) in some reports for securityRisk, but overall, the code is standard package setup with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code appears entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk (securityRisk):** 0.1 (due to optional dependencies and path extension, but very low risk overall)\n\nThis review confirms the code is safe, standard, and free from malicious behavior.",
