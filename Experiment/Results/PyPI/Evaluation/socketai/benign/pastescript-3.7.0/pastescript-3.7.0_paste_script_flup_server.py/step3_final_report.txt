{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to run WSGI applications over various protocols (AJP, FastCGI, SCGI) using the 'flup' library, primarily for server deployment and configuration.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as host, port, socket, allowedServers, scriptName, and multiplexed, which are supplied externally and used to configure network bindings and server behavior.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or code execution. The code primarily sets up server bindings and runs server instances.",
  "flows": "External inputs (host, port, socket, allowedServers) flow into server configuration functions, which then initialize and run server instances without executing untrusted code or data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Use of deprecated warnings is benign and for informational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of server setup functions that configure and launch servers over different protocols, accepting external parameters for network configuration. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The parameters are used for configuration only, and the code employs standard practices such as port cleanup and input validation. The warnings about deprecation are benign. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for deployment purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard server deployment utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are justified. The code's potential risks are limited to misconfiguration via external inputs, which is typical for such scripts, but does not constitute malicious activity.",
