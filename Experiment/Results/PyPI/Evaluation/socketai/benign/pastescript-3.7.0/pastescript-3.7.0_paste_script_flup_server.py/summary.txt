  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard server deployment utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are justified. The code's potential risks are limited to misconfiguration via external inputs, which is typical for such scripts, but does not constitute malicious activity."
