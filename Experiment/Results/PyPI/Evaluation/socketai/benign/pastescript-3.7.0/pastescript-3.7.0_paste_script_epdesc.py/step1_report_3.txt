  "purpose": "Define various descriptive classes for entry points and setup configurations in a Python packaging context.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and static string attributes describing entry points and setup options.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only contains class definitions with static descriptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The descriptions are purely informational.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple classes with class attributes containing descriptive strings about entry points and setup configurations. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behavior. No suspicious code, external data handling, or potential malicious activity is present. The structure is straightforward and static, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, providing static documentation for setup entry points. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
