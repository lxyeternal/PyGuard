  "purpose": "Static documentation classes defining entry points and setup configurations for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with static 'description' string attributes; no external data or input reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static documentation only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, dynamic behavior, or suspicious patterns; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions with descriptive strings, serving as documentation for package entry points. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or executable logic. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The static, documentation-only nature justifies these scores, and the high confidence scores are appropriate. No anomalies or inconsistencies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static documentation for package entry points. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
