  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for executing commands based on configuration and environment inputs. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection if untrusted configuration files or environment variables are used, but this is a known and typical risk for such tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting moderate caution due to dynamic command execution but no active malicious behavior."
