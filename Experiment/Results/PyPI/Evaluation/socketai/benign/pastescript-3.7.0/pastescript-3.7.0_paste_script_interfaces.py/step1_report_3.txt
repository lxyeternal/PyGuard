{
  "purpose": "Define an interface for application installation and configuration within the 'paste.app_install' entry point group.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; methods accept parameters but do not read from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output operations that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; methods are primarily placeholders or documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard interface definition with no implementation details, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods meant to be implemented elsewhere. It contains only docstrings and method signatures, with no executable or malicious code. There are no inputs read from untrusted sources, no data leakage points, and no suspicious operations. The class is part of a package's API structure for application configuration, and the code appears purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It does not process or leak sensitive data, nor does it contain any malicious code.",
