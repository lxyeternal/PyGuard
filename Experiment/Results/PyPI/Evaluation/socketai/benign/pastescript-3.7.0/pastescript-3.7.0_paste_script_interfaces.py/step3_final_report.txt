{
  "purpose": "This code defines an interface class for application installation objects within the Paste framework, providing method signatures and descriptive docstrings without implementation.",
  "sources": "Method signatures and docstrings serve as interface points; no data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code contains no executable logic or data flow.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code is purely declarative with no execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward interface with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class interface with method signatures and documentation, serving as a template within the Paste framework. It contains no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. The absence of implementation details, external data handling, or malicious constructs indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with this analysis. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface template with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
