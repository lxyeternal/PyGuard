  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of a class definition with method signatures and descriptive docstrings.\n- There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The class serves as an interface template within the Paste framework for application installation/configuration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.\n- All reports agree on its benign nature, with high confidence (1), zero malware, and zero security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   - The code does *not* contain any actual implementation, only interface definitions.  \n   - No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**  \n   - The reports correctly identify the lack of implementation as a feature of an interface, not a flaw.  \n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident in this pattern.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, and `obfuscated=0`, which is consistent with the benign, non-executable nature of the code.  \n   - The high confidence score (1) is justified.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification:**  \n   - Since there's no executable code, data flow, or external interaction, the risk is negligible.  \n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims:**  \n   - All claims are based on the static analysis of code structure and documentation, not on assumptions about hidden behavior.  \n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond the code's surface.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n\nGiven the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Code Status:** Benign interface definition, no malicious code or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:** Consistent and reasonable; no changes needed.  \n- **Confidence:** Fully justified at 1.  \n- **Potential for Supply Chain Threats:** None evident.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is a safe, standard interface template with no security issues or malware risk. The current scores are accurate and should be maintained.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for actual implementations of such interfaces, as malicious subclasses could introduce vulnerabilities, but based solely on this snippet, the assessment is clear.",
