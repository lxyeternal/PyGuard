  "purpose": "Utility functions for compatibility with different versions of Hadoop, managing configuration key translations and environment variable retrieval.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ; internal static mappings for configuration key variants.",
  "sinks": "Retrieval of configuration values; no external code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are checked directly and via mappings; configuration keys are translated based on version; no external data flow or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static utility functions for configuration management, primarily reading environment variables and translating configuration keys based on Hadoop version. It does not execute external code, perform network operations, or handle untrusted data beyond configuration lookups. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The environment variable access is standard for configuration scripts and not inherently malicious. The code's structure and purpose are benign, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for Hadoop configuration compatibility, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. It performs standard configuration translation and environment variable retrieval without any malicious intent or activity.",
