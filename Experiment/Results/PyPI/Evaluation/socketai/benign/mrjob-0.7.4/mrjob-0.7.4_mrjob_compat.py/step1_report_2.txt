{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for maintaining compatibility with different Hadoop versions by managing configuration property names and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via os.environ) and input dictionaries (jobconf parameter).",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to data leak or system effect; no direct untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are checked for configuration data; functions translate and map configuration keys based on Hadoop version, passing data through internal functions without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily performs configuration name translation and environment variable retrieval, which are typical for compatibility layers.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary functions involve retrieving configuration parameters from environment variables or dictionaries and translating property names based on Hadoop versions. It includes mappings for compatibility and version comparison functions. No code indicates malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network connections, or harmful system modifications. The usage of environment variables and configuration translation appears standard and safe, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility utility for Hadoop configurations, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It handles environment data and configuration translation securely and transparently. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low, and it appears safe for use.",
