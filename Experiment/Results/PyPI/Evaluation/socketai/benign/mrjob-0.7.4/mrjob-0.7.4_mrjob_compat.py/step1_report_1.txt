{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for compatibility with different Hadoop versions, mapping configuration variable names across versions, and retrieving job configuration data from environment variables or dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), input parameters (jobconf dictionaries, variable names), and internal static mappings (_JOBCONF_DICT_LIST, _JOBCONF_MAP).",
  "sinks": "Retrieving environment variables could influence configuration settings; translation functions modify configuration property names, but do not execute or inject code; no data leaks or code execution points are present.",
  "flows": "Input source: environment variables or function parameters → Processing through mapping and translation functions → Configuration data returned or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Code uses standard libraries, and no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present. Logging warnings for translation issues are benign.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs configuration management tasks, mapping configuration property names across Hadoop versions, fetching environment variables, and comparing version strings. The functions rely on static mappings and standard libraries without executing or manipulating external data beyond configuration retrieval and translation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, network access, or hidden backdoors. The code is well-structured and designed for compatibility and logging. The only potential concern would be if environment variables were maliciously manipulated externally, but this is a standard pattern in configuration scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module intended for configuration compatibility in Hadoop-related environments. No malicious activity, sabotage, or malware is evident. It primarily manages configuration property names and retrieves environment data securely. Therefore, the overall security risk is minimal.",
