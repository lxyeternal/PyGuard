{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for Hadoop version compatibility and environment-based configuration translation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), input configuration dictionaries (jobconf), and version strings.",
  "sinks": "Returns environment variable values, dictionary values, or translated configuration keys. No direct data leakage or system modification is observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are accessed and mapped through dictionaries to produce configuration values; configuration translation functions process input dictionaries and version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is primarily for compatibility and translation of configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured utility functions for handling Hadoop configuration compatibility across versions. It reads environment variables and configuration dictionaries, translating property names based on version mappings. No obfuscated code, no network connections, file modifications, or malicious intent evident. The functions perform version comparisons, environment variable lookups, and configuration key translations, all typical for configuration management scripts. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for Hadoop configuration compatibility with no malicious behavior detected. It performs environment and dictionary lookups, version comparisons, and key translations for configuration management, which are common in open-source Hadoop-related utilities.",
