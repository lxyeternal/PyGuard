  "purpose": "Configuration management functions for mrjob, including locating, parsing, merging, and exporting configuration files in YAML or JSON formats, with support for custom tags like !clear.",
  "sources": "File reads via open(), environment variables, and path expansions; YAML/JSON parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures; no external network or unsafe sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration files and environment variables into internal data structures; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom YAML tags (!clear) and recursive processing are standard for configuration handling; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured configuration utility that safely handles file discovery, parsing, and merging with support for YAML and JSON. It employs standard libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unsafe operations. The use of custom tags and recursive functions is typical for configuration management. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and serves its purpose as a configuration management utility without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
