  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided code content, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as metadata, licensing, author/contributor info, and documentation.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- Contributor lists are extensive but appear legitimate and typical for open-source projects.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Metadata, licensing, authorship, description of Hadoop jobs.\n- **Findings:** Only comments, no executable code.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies no malicious or suspicious content.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 (accurate)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (accurate)\n  - securityRisk: 0 (accurate)\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Documentation for Hadoop Streaming jobs.\n- **Findings:** Only comments and metadata.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Licensing and documentation.\n- **Findings:** Metadata, no executable logic.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Metadata for managing Hadoop jobs.\n- **Findings:** Extensive contributor list, no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The contributor list is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 (correct)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Metadata for Hadoop job management.\n- **Findings:** Only metadata, no executable logic.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable comments.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, justified by the absence of executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is purely metadata and documentation, with no security concerns.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
