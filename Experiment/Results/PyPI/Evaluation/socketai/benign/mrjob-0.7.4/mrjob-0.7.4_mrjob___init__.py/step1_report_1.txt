  "purpose": "The code provides metadata, licensing information, author and contributor details, and a brief description about writing and running Hadoop Streaming jobs on various cloud platforms.",
  "sources": "Metadata comments, author, contributor, and license information, version declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic are present; only static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive contributor and author lists; no executable code or dynamic logic; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments; no obfuscated code or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, license, authorship, and metadata declarations with no functional or executable components. There are no input sources, data processing, or data sinks that could be exploited or used maliciously. The contributor list is extensive but appears legitimate and typical for open-source projects. No anomalies, malicious code, or security risks are detectable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata and licensing information with no executable logic or malicious components. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
