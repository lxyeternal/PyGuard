{
  "purpose": "Provide a description for writing and running Hadoop Streaming jobs on various clusters.",
  "sources": "The code reads author and contributor information, license details, and versioning metadata from comments and string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; the code does not handle external inputs or data outputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the script primarily contains metadata and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code is mostly license headers, metadata, and documentation strings with no executable logic, input handling, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing, author, and contributor information, along with version metadata and descriptive comments. No executable logic, data processing, or network communication is present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The structure is typical for Python module headers, and no malicious or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not contain any executable logic or data handling that could pose security risks. It appears to be a standard header and documentation block for a Python module related to Hadoop streaming jobs, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
