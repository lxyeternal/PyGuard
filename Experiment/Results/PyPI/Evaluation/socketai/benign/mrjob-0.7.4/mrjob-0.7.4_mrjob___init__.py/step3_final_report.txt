  "purpose": "This code contains only metadata, licensing, author, and contributor information related to Hadoop streaming jobs; no executable logic present.",
  "sources": "Comments, docstrings, and metadata sections where author, license, and contributor info are declared.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external data handling present; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths, as the code is purely metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected; contributor list extensive but legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely metadata and documentation with no executable code, data processing, or network activity. All contributor and license information are comments and string literals. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The contributor list, while large, appears typical for open-source projects. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the content and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only metadata and licensing information. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
