  "purpose": "Utility functions and compatibility layers for making Python code compatible across different Python versions (2.7+ and 3.4+).",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.stdin.buffer, file contents, log files, configuration files, environment variables, and URL parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially where untrusted data could be logged, printed, or processed in a way that could lead to security issues, though no explicit sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (from sys.stdin.buffer or external files) can be converted to unicode via to_unicode(), but no complex flow or data manipulation is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies; the code appears to be standard utility code for compatibility, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version compatibility variables and functions, primarily for string and URL handling. It includes safe conversions of bytes to unicode, ensuring encoding issues are mitigated. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The use of standard library functions and straightforward code indicates benign intent. The module serves as an abstraction layer, not executing any potentially harmful actions or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module designed for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its sole purpose is to facilitate string, URL, and input handling in a consistent manner across different Python environments.",
