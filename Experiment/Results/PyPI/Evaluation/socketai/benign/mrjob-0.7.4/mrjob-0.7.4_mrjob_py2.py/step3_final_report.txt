  "purpose": "Compatibility utilities supporting Python 2.7+ and 3.4+, including string handling, URL parsing, and input/output abstractions.",
  "sources": "Input data bytes, data from sys.stdin.buffer, files, logs, and other external sources that may provide data to be decoded or processed.",
  "sinks": "Decoding functions like to_unicode() that convert bytes to unicode, and URL parsing functions that process external URLs.",
  "flows": "Bytes read from external sources flow into to_unicode() for decoding; no external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer handling differences between Python 2 and 3. It defines type checks, imports, and a safe decoding function. The to_unicode() function decodes bytes with a fallback encoding, which is a common and safe practice. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code's purpose is purely utility and compatibility, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to decoding untrusted data, which is handled safely. The overall structure and logic are straightforward and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "This dependency is a benign, well-structured compatibility utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is around 0.1 to reflect minimal potential risk due to decoding untrusted bytes, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security concerns.",
