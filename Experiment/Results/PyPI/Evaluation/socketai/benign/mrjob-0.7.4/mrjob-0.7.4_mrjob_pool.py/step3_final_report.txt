  "purpose": "Utilities for managing EMR cluster pooling, including tagging, naming, extracting tags, and locking clusters via AWS tags to coordinate resource sharing and prevent conflicts.",
  "sources": "Cluster descriptions, tags, cluster state information, AWS API responses, and internal configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "AWS API calls for describing clusters, adding/removing tags, and listing steps; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Code reads cluster tags and state (sources), then applies or verifies locks and tags (sinks), based on cluster state and configuration (flows).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AWS resource management functions for cluster pooling, including tagging, extracting tags, naming conventions, and locking mechanisms. It handles errors appropriately, uses AWS SDK calls correctly, and implements locking via tags with expiration logic. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security model relies on tags for coordination, which is a common pattern but can be misused if tags are manipulated externally. The risk scores assigned (0 for malware and obfuscation, 0.1-0.2 for security risk) are consistent with the code's functionality and known operational patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for EMR cluster pooling and locking, with no malicious or sabotage signals. The minor security risk reflects potential misuse if tags are manipulated, but this is inherent to resource tagging mechanisms and not indicative of malicious intent.",
