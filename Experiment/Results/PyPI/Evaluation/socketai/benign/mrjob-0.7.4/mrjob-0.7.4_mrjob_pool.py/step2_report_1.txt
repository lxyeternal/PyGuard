  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code manages EMR cluster pooling, tagging, and locking, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. It correctly identifies the code's purpose as resource management via AWS SDK interactions.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or suspicious behaviors are identified. The logic and implementation align with standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  These seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report is consistent and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as utilities for EMR cluster management, with no malicious or suspicious activity. It emphasizes standard API interactions, proper error handling, and resource management.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or malicious signals detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  These are consistent with the report's findings.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate and well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is described as a legitimate utility for cluster pooling, with proper checks and no malicious behavior. It notes that the code manages locks via tags, with standard AWS practices.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No suspicious or malicious activity identified.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  The slight increase in security risk (0.1) reflects the potential misuse if someone manipulates the locking tags maliciously, but this is a known and accepted risk in resource locking mechanisms. It is not indicative of malicious code.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages cluster pooling and locking via tags, with proper validation and no malicious activity. It correctly notes that misuse of tags could influence cluster management but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No malicious signals detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  Slightly higher risk score is justified due to potential misuse of locking tags, but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard utility for cluster pooling, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It interacts with AWS APIs for resource management.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No suspicious activity or malicious signals.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  This is reasonable, considering the potential for misconfiguration or misuse but not malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a legitimate utility for managing EMR clusters via tagging and locking mechanisms. The operations are standard, transparent, and intended for resource management.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as zero, which is justified. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated risk scores (0.1–0.2) reflect the potential for misuse if tags are manipulated maliciously, but this is inherent to any resource locking mechanism using tags.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n  No malicious activity or signals detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n  Code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1**  \n  Slightly above zero due to potential misuse of locking tags, but not indicative of actual malicious intent.\n\n- **Justification:** The code performs legitimate cluster management tasks. While misuse of tags could cause operational issues, it does not constitute malware or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe utility for EMR cluster pooling and locking, with no malicious signals. The minor security risk score reflects potential operational misuse, not malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1",
