  "purpose": "Utilities for managing cluster pooling, tagging, and locking on EMR, specifically designed to handle pooled cluster identification, validation, and concurrency control.",
  "sources": "Reads cluster tags, cluster status, and configuration data from EMR clusters and user-specified parameters, as well as input parameters like job keys and expiry times.",
  "sinks": "Adds or removes tags on clusters to implement locking, checks cluster states and steps, and parses lock information from tags.",
  "flows": "Reads cluster tags/status -> determines lock state -> attempts to set or release lock tags -> validates cluster and step conditions -> manages concurrency locks.",
  "anomalies": "None of the code performs unusual or suspicious activities; it primarily manages cluster tags for locking and tagging based on standard EMR cluster attributes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cluster pooling management and locking mechanisms using EMR tags to coordinate job execution and prevent concurrent modifications. It carefully reads cluster metadata, manages lock tags with expiry timestamps, and ensures only one process can lock a cluster at a time, releasing locks appropriately. No malicious logic or privacy-invasive activities are present. It relies on standard AWS SDK calls and proper validation of input data. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code, and the functions serve legitimate resource management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, intended for cluster pooling and concurrency control in EMR environments. It uses tags to coordinate access securely and does not contain any malicious or sabotage behaviors. There are no indications of malware or security risks within this module.",
