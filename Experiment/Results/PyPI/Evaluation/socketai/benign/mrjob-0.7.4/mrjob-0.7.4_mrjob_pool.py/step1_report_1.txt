{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for managing pooled EMR clusters, including tagging, locking, and ensuring proper configuration of clusters for pooling and resource satisfaction.",
  "sources": "Reading cluster tags, cluster descriptions, and configuration parameters such as instance types, fleet specifications, and EBS configurations.",
  "sinks": "Modifying cluster tags (locks), adding tags to clusters, and performing checks on cluster states and step counts.",
  "flows": "Code reads cluster data and tags (sources), then conditionally adds or removes tags or makes decisions based on cluster state (sinks), such as locking or unlocking clusters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious backdoors. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or system modifications are evident. The code solely interacts with AWS EMR via standard SDK calls and manages cluster tags and states.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions for EMR cluster pooling, involving safe tag manipulation, cluster state checks, and locking mechanisms. No network communications, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The code uses standard AWS SDK interactions, handles exceptions properly, and does not perform any data leaks, unauthorized access, or system harm. All operations are within expected cloud management tasks. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility library for cluster pooling management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages cluster tags and states securely and transparently. No malicious signals detected.",
