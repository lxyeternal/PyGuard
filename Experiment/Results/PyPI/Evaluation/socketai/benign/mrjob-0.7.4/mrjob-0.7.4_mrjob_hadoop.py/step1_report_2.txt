{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Hadoop job runner for executing MapReduce jobs on Hadoop clusters, managing setup, execution, and log parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include local files, HDFS paths, environment variables, and command-line arguments. Data is read during job execution, file uploads, and log parsing.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into command arguments, environment variables, and log processing functions, especially via subprocess execution and log interpretation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables and file paths into subprocess commands (e.g., Hadoop commands), and logs parsed from stderr/stdout are used for job status and counters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code includes standard practices for Hadoop job management and log parsing. Use of pty and subprocess is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully manages Hadoop job execution, including environment setup, command construction, and log parsing. It searches for Hadoop binaries, streaming jars, and log directories using standard paths. It processes logs for counters and errors, but all operations involve standard system calls, subprocess management, and string handling without suspicious patterns. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is detected. It adheres to typical best practices for job execution and monitoring, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Hadoop job runner designed for managing and executing jobs, parsing logs, and handling configuration. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. It functions as intended for a secure job execution environment.",
