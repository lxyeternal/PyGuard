  "purpose": "Utilities for creating and managing AWS IAM roles, instance profiles, and policies to facilitate EMR setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements, constants defining IAM roles and policies, functions that interact with AWS IAM client to create or retrieve roles and profiles.",
  "sinks": "AWS IAM client API calls that create roles, attach policies, and create instance profiles.",
  "flows": "Function calls to get_or_create_mrjob_service_role and get_or_create_mrjob_instance_profile invoke role/profile retrieval or creation, involving policy and role data, with API calls creating or modifying AWS IAM resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external data sources, no network activity, and no code that performs data exfiltration or malicious system modifications. The code solely manages IAM resources within AWS, which is typical for automation scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for AWS IAM resource management, with functions to check for existing roles/profiles and create them if necessary. It uses AWS API calls to manage roles, policies, and instance profiles. No embedded or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity is present. The role policies and creation methods follow AWS best practices for resource setup. The code is well-structured, purpose-specific, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate, purpose-driven IAM utility code for AWS EMR setup, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within AWS SDK's IAM management scope and does not include any malicious or suspicious functionality.",
