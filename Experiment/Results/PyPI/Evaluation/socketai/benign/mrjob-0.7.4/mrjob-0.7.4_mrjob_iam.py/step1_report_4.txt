  "purpose": "Utilities for creating and managing AWS IAM roles, instance profiles, and policies for EMR clusters, specifically to automate setup and ensure proper permissions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static role and policy definitions, AWS API calls for listing roles and profiles, and creates roles and profiles via API.",
  "sinks": "API calls to create roles, attach policies, and create instance profiles; these are administrative actions rather than untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "The code checks existing roles/profiles for matches, then creates new roles/profiles if needed, based on static templates and random identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. All operations are standard IAM role/profile management; no unexpected external network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages AWS IAM roles and profiles for EMR, with role and policy templates, and functions to check existence and create new roles/profiles as needed. It uses static role policies, AWS SDK API calls, and random identifier generation. No dynamic data input from untrusted sources, no malicious commands, no hidden behaviors. No code injection or obfuscated code observed. The purpose aligns with automating AWS infrastructure setup. No indications of malicious intent or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing AWS IAM roles and profiles for EMR clusters, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs standard IAM management operations using AWS SDK, with no suspicious or malicious activity.",
