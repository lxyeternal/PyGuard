  "purpose": "Utilities for creating and managing AWS IAM roles, instance profiles, and policies for EMR clusters, ensuring proper permissions and trust relationships.",
  "sources": "Reads role and profile definitions, AWS SDK API calls to list and create roles/profiles, and policy attachments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; primarily AWS API interactions for resource management.",
  "flows": "Checks existing roles/profiles, compares policies, creates roles/profiles if needed, attaches policies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; static role documents and ARNs are standard, no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard IAM resource management: listing roles/profiles, matching policy documents and attached policies, creating roles/profiles with random identifiers, and attaching managed policies. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical AWS setup scripts. The malware score is correctly 0, as there are no malicious actions. The obfuscation score is 0, given the code clarity. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risks of IAM resource creation but justified by the code's benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for AWS IAM role and profile management for EMR, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
