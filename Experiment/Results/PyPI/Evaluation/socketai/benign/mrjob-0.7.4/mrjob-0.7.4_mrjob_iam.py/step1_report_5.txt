  "purpose": "Utilities for creating and managing AWS IAM roles, instance profiles, and policies for EMR integration, primarily to automate setup and ensure correct permissions.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'client' parameter (AWS IAM client), uses hardcoded role and policy definitions, and the 'random_identifier' function for generating role names.",
  "sinks": "Creates IAM roles and instance profiles, attaches policies, and logs actions. No external data sinks or network calls other than AWS API interactions.",
  "flows": "Code flows from checking existing roles/profiles to creating new roles/profiles if none match, then attaching policies and returning role/profile names.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of 'random_identifier' for role names is normal. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. Logging is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AWS IAM role and profile management for EMR setup, including role existence checks, creation, and attaching policies. It uses predictable role and profile definitions aligned with AWS documentation. No suspicious code patterns, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions depend on proper AWS credentials and permissions but do not themselves contain vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The role matching logic and creation routines are straightforward and aligned with AWS best practices. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, intended for automating AWS IAM setup for EMR, and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for such utility functions.",
