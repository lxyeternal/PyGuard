{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive base class for defining MapReduce jobs, managing protocols, command-line parsing, and execution flow for local or distributed environments.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files or stdin, environment variables, and command-line arguments; loads configuration and user-defined methods.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed data to stdout, logs counters and status messages to stderr, and handles protocol serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through user-implemented mapper/reducer methods, with protocols managing data encoding, culminating in output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or network activity; standard logging and exception handling; user-overridable methods are placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, open-source framework for MR jobs, with clear separation of concerns, no embedded malicious logic, and no obfuscation. Potential misuse exists if subclasses override command methods maliciously, but this is an intended extension point, not a flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source MRJob framework with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
