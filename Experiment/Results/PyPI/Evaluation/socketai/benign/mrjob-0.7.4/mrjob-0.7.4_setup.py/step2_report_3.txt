  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The code is a typical setup script managing dependencies and metadata.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.95 (very high confidence in benign nature). The confidence score is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic. The script is standard for package distribution.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirming the script is a standard setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=1.0. The confidence is high, given the straightforward nature.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The setup process is transparent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting the environment-dependent dependency adjustments, but still concluding no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. The risk score is low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** Conditional dependency management is common and does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is minimal.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirming the script is a standard setup with environment-aware dependency handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently zero across all reports; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.95, mostly at 0 or very low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review and consensus:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation or hidden logic)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Note:** The setup script is a standard, well-structured package configuration with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The dependency management and environment-specific adjustments are typical and do not indicate malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and I concur with them.",
