{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the 'mrjob' Python package, managing dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads external files ('README.rst'), environment variables (sys.version_info, sys.pypy_version_info), and package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or user input processed during setup.",
  "flows": "Environment checks influence dependency inclusion; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional dependency adjustments based on environment and Python version are standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script utilizing setuptools or distutils, managing dependencies conditionally based on environment and Python version. It reads a static README file, sets package metadata, and defines entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. The dependency management is environment-aware but standard practice. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The initial high risk scores in some reports are overestimations; the code's transparency and adherence to common practices confirm its safety.",
