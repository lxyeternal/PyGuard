  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'mrjob' Python package, intended to specify package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and configuration data from the script itself and an external README file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the script does not perform data output or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The script defines dependencies and package setup parameters without executing any data flow or untrusted inputs to vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package with conditional dependency management based on environment and Python version. It includes license comments, dependency lists, and package metadata. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or other risky operations are present. The dependencies are well-defined and are typical for a package setup, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely defines package configuration for distribution.",
