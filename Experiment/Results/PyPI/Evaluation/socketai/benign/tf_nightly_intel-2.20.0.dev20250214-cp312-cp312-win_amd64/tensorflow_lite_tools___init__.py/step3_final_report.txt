  "purpose": "Review open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input data reads, environment variables, network calls, file I/O, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks through data processing, network requests, or environment interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, malicious payloads, or obfuscation detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security misconfigurations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), and the malware score is 0, indicating no malicious behavior. The security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the benign description. The analysis is consistent across multiple reviews, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Given the absence of code snippets or suspicious signals, the conclusion remains that the dependency is safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
