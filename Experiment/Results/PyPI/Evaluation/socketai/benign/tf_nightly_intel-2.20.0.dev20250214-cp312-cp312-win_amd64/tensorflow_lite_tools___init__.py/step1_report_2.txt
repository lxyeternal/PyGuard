  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger application, possibly involving external data sources.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input via function parameters, and possibly from external files or network sources (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network connections, or logs; uses functions that could output data externally.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or user input flows through processing functions and may reach output functions or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code patterns or suspicious dynamic execution. No unusual code constructs or hidden backdoors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. No evidence of malicious payloads, suspicious network connections, or credential theft mechanisms were found. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. The structure appears straightforward, with no hidden or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be standard application logic with no security risks identified in this isolated review.",
