{
  "purpose": "This script creates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite graph for analysis and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads TFLite model files (.tflite, .json), environment for file existence checks, and external D3.js library loaded via CDN.",
  "sinks": "Generates static HTML output; no data sinks or network activity; no untrusted data processing beyond file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads model data from files or objects, converts flatbuffer to dict, then builds HTML with embedded visualization scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard file handling and external library loading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for visualizing TensorFlow Lite models. It reads model files, processes data into JSON, and generates static HTML with embedded D3.js visualization. No network communication, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. External resources are loaded via CDN, which is standard for such tools. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The minimal risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by external resource loading but does not indicate any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured visualization utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.0–0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
