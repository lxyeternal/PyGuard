{
  "purpose": "This script visualizes a TensorFlow Lite model by generating an interactive HTML graph representation.",
  "sources": "Reads input file path or model object, loads model data (from file or JSON), and reads data from the model's subgraphs, tensors, and operator codes.",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML output to a specified file; no other sink behaviors detected.",
  "flows": "Input file path → file read → data parsing → HTML generation → file write.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is primarily visualization with standard data processing and HTML/JavaScript generation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs model data loading, conversion, and visualization. It includes standard data serialization, graph rendering with D3.js, and JSON handling. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on external files and libraries for visualization purposes and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. All functions serve to parse, convert, and visualize model data securely, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It is safe for use from a security perspective.",
