  "purpose": "This script generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model for analysis and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads model data from a file path (tflite file or json), or directly from a model object passed in as a parameter.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated HTML visualization to an output file specified by the user.",
  "flows": "Model data is read from the input source, processed into a dictionary, and then used to generate HTML content. The content is then written to the output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses external libraries (like D3.js) only for visualization purposes. No network calls or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models. It reads model files (.tflite, .json), converts flatbuffer data into dictionaries, and generates HTML with embedded D3.js visualizations. It does not contain any code that performs network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. The code handles input/output safely, with proper file checks. The only external interaction is loading D3.js for visualization purposes, which is standard for such tools. The code's structure, including function definitions, data processing, and output, is typical and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization utility for TensorFlow Lite models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads model data, processes it, and outputs HTML for visualization, all in a manner consistent with standard tooling. No malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
