{
  "purpose": "This script visualizes TensorFlow Lite models by generating an HTML representation with embedded D3.js visualizations.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths (tflite model files or JSON files) from command line arguments; reads files from filesystem; loads JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated HTML to specified output file.",
  "flows": "Reads model files -> processes data -> generates HTML/JavaScript code -> writes HTML to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network connections; no suspicious file operations beyond standard file reading/writing; uses external D3.js library for visualization without data exfiltration; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; data is processed locally and output is static HTML.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads TensorFlow Lite model files or JSON representations, converts them into nested dictionaries, and generates a static HTML visualization using embedded JavaScript and D3.js. It includes functions for converting enums to names, mapping tensors, generating graph structures, and rendering tables. The file operations are limited to reading input models and writing output HTML. There are no indications of network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The external D3.js library is loaded via a CDN for visualization purposes, which is standard for such tools. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates purely locally, processes input files, and produces static HTML output without network activity or sensitive data handling beyond model data. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
