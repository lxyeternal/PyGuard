  "purpose": "A debugging and analysis tool for TensorFlow Lite quantized models, involving model conversion, inference, metrics collection, and report generation.",
  "sources": "Reads model files, dataset generator, internal API calls for tensor and op details, and writes CSV reports.",
  "sinks": "Outputs CSV reports; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Loads models -> runs inference -> collects tensor data -> computes metrics -> writes CSV reports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses internal APIs typical for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, purpose-specific debugging utility for quantized TensorFlow Lite models. It performs model conversion, inference, metrics collection, and report generation without any network activity or malicious behavior. Use of internal APIs is standard for debugging tools and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate debugging and verification functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate debugging utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. It poses negligible security risk, primarily due to its purpose and internal API usage. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
