{
  "purpose": "The code implements a TensorFlow Lite Quantization Debugger for analyzing and debugging quantized models, collecting statistics, and comparing models.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (paths or content), dataset generator for input data, and interpreters' tensor details.",
  "sinks": "Uses interpreters to run models and extract tensor data; potential data leaks if tensor details are misused but no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dataset to model via interpreters, with statistics computed on tensor outputs; no external data flow outside the interpreters and dataset generator.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries and TensorFlow modules. No obfuscated code features, no unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of a debugging tool for TensorFlow Lite quantized models. It reads models and datasets, runs models via interpreters, and collects metrics for debugging purposes. There is extensive use of standard TensorFlow APIs, and no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious system actions. The use of protected attributes (e.g., '_get_ops_details') is typical for internal APIs and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious external network calls, file operations, or secret handling are present. The code performs model analysis and debugging functions without any suspicious data sinks or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate TensorFlow Lite debugging utility with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. It is designed for internal model analysis, with no malicious signals detected.",
