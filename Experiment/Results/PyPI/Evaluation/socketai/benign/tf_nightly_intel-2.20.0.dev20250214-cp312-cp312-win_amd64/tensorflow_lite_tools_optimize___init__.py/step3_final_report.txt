{
  "purpose": "To assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing the provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function calls, environment variable access, network connections, data handling points, and any code execution or obfuscated patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, or code execution points that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "flows": "From data input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) through processing functions to sinks such as network calls, file writes, or environment modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, unusual code constructs, unnecessary dynamic execution, or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "All provided code snippets are minimal or straightforward, primarily consisting of import statements or simple scripts. Static analysis shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2, confidence=0.8-1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The cautious approach for incomplete snippets is justified, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are detected. The static review aligns with the overall low security risk and absence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the high confidence reflects the static analysis results. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
