  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to import and potentially use various Python modules, but without specific context or functionality, its main goal seems to be setup or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imports, environment variables, or external modules if used later (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or command executions are shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Without further code, no clear source-to-sink data flows can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports, are detected in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of import statements. There are no visible input sources such as user input, environment variables, or network data. Likewise, there are no sinks such as system calls, network connections, or data exfiltration points. The structure is straightforward, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation is present. Without additional code, it's impossible to determine data flows or malicious intent. The imports are standard, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard import statements, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation. The overall security risk is very low, but the assessment is limited to the given fragment.",
