  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Use of 'eval'/'exec' with untrusted inputs, input/output functions, data processing routines, security analysis tools, or absence of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential code injection points via 'eval'/'exec', data leaks through network or file outputs, or other untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Sources like untrusted inputs leading to 'eval'/'exec' or other dynamic code execution, possibly reaching sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution functions with unverified inputs, absence of code, or descriptions indicating benign utility without actual code snippets.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code, with scores aligned to their descriptions. Report 3's mention of 'eval'/'exec' with untrusted inputs warrants a higher malware score due to the security concern, even without confirmed malicious payloads. Other reports are benign, with low risk and malware scores. Minor adjustments are recommended: increase malware score for Report 3 from 0.2 to 0.4, and slightly lower risk scores for Reports 4 and 5 from 0.2 to 0.1, reflecting their benign nature. Overall, the scores are consistent with the provided descriptions and observed patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and cautious. The primary concern is the use of dynamic execution functions in Report 3, which justifies a higher malware score. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately low. Minor score adjustments improve alignment with the described code behaviors.",
