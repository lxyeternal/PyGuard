  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, but no specific purpose is evident due to lack of context or descriptive comments.",
  "sources": "Input is not explicitly read from external sources such as user input, environment variables, or network data.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or execution of external commands are present.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows; the code performs isolated operations without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. No malicious or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Usage of third-party libraries is typical, and no dangerous operations are evident. No source of untrusted input or critical sinks are identified. The structure and content suggest a benign, standard script without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or potential abuse detected.",
