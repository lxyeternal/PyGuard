  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their low malware and risk scores, given the lack of code. Report 3's mention of eval/exec warrants elevating the malware score to reflect the potential threat. Overall, the assessments are reasonable, but the risk level for report 3 should be increased to account for dynamic code execution concerns."
