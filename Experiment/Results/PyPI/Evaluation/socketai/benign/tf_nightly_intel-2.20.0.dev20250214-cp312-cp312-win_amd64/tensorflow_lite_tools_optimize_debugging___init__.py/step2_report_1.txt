  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the justification for risk levels.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Code presence & issues:** The report states no obvious malware or hardcoded secrets, with concern about dynamic execution functions like eval()/exec(). No code snippets are provided, so we cannot confirm their usage.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the low concern.  \n- **Justification:** The risk score is low (0.2), justified by the lack of evidence of malicious activity, but with a note to review dynamic execution if present.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores align with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Code presence & issues:** No explicit code provided, only a high-level description. The analysis notes the lack of suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Given the absence of code and no suspicious activity, the low risk score is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Code presence & issues:** No code snippet; analysis is based on typical patterns. The report notes potential risks but finds no concrete evidence.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Without code, the cautious low risk score is acceptable.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Code presence & issues:** The analysis describes a straightforward script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** The benign assessment supports the low risk score.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Code presence & issues:** Similar to others, no explicit code, but the analysis finds no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** The low risk score is consistent with the benign description.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of evidence for malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the reports stating no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across the board, justified by the cautious approach given the lack of detailed code and potential for dynamic execution.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- Given the descriptions, the scores are reasonable and consistent.  \n- No adjustments needed unless actual code snippets reveal hidden malicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- For future assessments, if code is provided, a more precise evaluation can be made.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to potential dynamic execution concerns, but no evidence)\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are appropriate based on the provided summaries. Vigilance should be maintained if actual code reveals hidden behaviors, but current data supports low risk and no malware concerns.",
