{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a module that performs some data processing or utility functions, but without further context, the specific intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, and possibly external files or network sources, depending on the content of imported modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or data serialization functions, especially if untrusted input is passed directly without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions through processing functions, possibly reaching network or file output operations without validation, which could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious logic such as reverse shells, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The code structure appears standard, with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines functions that perform typical data processing tasks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. Usage of environment variables and inputs appears standard, with no risky operations or insecure practices detected. The absence of external network calls, hidden payloads, or secret keys reduces suspicion. Overall, the code looks benign, though lack of context prevents complete certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems standard and safe, with no indications of malware or obfuscation.",
