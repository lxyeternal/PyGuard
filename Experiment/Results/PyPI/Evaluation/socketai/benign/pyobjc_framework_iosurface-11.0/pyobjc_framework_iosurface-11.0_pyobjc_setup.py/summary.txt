  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, well-structured build and test configuration for PyObjC on macOS. It contains no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. The use of subprocess calls and dynamic imports is typical and safe in this context. The security risk is minimal and justified by the environment's trusted nature."
