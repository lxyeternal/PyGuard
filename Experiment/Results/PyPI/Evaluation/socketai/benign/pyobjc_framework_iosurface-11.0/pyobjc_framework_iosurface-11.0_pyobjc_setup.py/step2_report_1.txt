  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, reasoning accuracy, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script configures build, install, and test commands for PyObjC, relying on environment variables, subprocess calls, file reads, and module imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** System info (e.g., SDK, clang version) flows into build info files; subprocess outputs and file reads are standard for build scripts.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity. The subprocess calls are standard system queries (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`), and the code structure is transparent.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is a legitimate build setup with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 1 (appropriate, given the comprehensive analysis and confidence)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on environment and system commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** System commands and environment variables influence build configuration; dynamic module loading is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Use of subprocesses to call `sw_vers`, `clang`, etc., is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is a standard setup utility, with low security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to reliance on system commands, but acceptable)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a build/setup script with system calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar to above, with subprocesses gathering system info, affecting build configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of subprocess for system info is typical; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is a legitimate build/test setup, low security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Setup utility for building/testing, with environment and system commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard subprocess calls, file reads, environment variable usage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity; subprocess calls are standard for such scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script, low risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build/test setup, with environment variables, subprocess calls, dynamic imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same pattern—system info influences build, test modules loaded dynamically.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of subprocess to run system commands and dynamic module imports could be risky if test files are malicious, but this is standard for test environments.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; standard setup pattern.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (reasonable, given the dynamic module loading, but within normal bounds)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, scoring 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation, scoring 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1–0.2), justified by the nature of the code.\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code is transparent, standard build scripts.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, given reliance on system commands, which is typical for build scripts but still warrants low caution.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for a build environment.
