  "purpose": "Setup and load the IOSurface framework for use in Python, including dynamic attribute and directory creation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dynamic framework path, and framework setup functions",
  "sinks": "Dynamic creation of __dir__ and __getattr__, deletion of a module from sys.modules",
  "flows": "Imports → dynamic framework setup → modification of globals → deletion from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation functions and modification of sys.modules entries; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and Foundation modules, then uses objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to dynamically create __dir__ and __getattr__ functions for the IOSurface framework. These functions are assigned globally, enabling dynamic attribute access. It then deletes the '_metadata' module from sys.modules, likely to clean up or prevent re-import. The code primarily facilitates framework loading and dynamic attribute management without any suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard dynamic framework loader.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for loading a macOS framework with dynamic attribute handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks; it appears to be boilerplate framework initialization code.",
