  "purpose": "This code sets up Python bindings for the macOS IOSurface framework by dynamically creating framework directories and attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, Foundation, objc, _metadata), dynamic framework loading via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute creation functions (dir_func, getattr_func), deletion of sys.modules entry",
  "flows": "Imports sys and framework modules, calls createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to set up framework access, assigns functions to globals, deletes module reference from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation and modification of globals and sys.modules; no hardcoded secrets, no network or file manipulation observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes framework bindings by importing necessary modules and invoking createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, which is a standard dynamic framework loading pattern. The deletion of sys.modules entry is a typical cleanup step. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is consistent with standard Python wrapping of macOS frameworks and employs no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup routine for integrating the IOSurface framework into Python. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
