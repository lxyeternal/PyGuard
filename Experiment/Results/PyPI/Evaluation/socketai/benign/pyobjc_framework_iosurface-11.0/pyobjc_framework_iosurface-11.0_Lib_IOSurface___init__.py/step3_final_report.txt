  "purpose": "Set up Python bindings for the macOS IOSurface framework by dynamically creating directory and attribute getter functions, assigning them globally, and cleaning up internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, Foundation, objc modules; uses objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to generate functions; accesses framework path; deletes _metadata from sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute functions (__dir__, __getattr__) assigned globally; deletion of sys.modules entry for _metadata.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> creates framework directory and getter functions -> assigns functions to globals -> deletes _metadata module from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic function creation and deletion of internal modules, which are typical in binding code but could be misused in malicious contexts; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup for Python bindings to a system framework, involving dynamic attribute creation and module cleanup. No malicious activity, network operations, or data leaks are present. The use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr is a common pattern. Deleting _metadata from sys.modules is unusual but not malicious; likely for cleanup. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate framework setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. The low malware and risk scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
