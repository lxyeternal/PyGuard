  "purpose": "Initialize and set up the Python bindings for the IOSurface framework on macOS, including dynamic framework loading and attribute creation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, Foundation, objc, _metadata), calls to objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr for framework setup.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that process untrusted input; dynamic attribute creation and module manipulation are used internally.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> calls createFrameworkDirAndGetattr -> sets __dir__ and __getattr__ -> deletes internal module reference.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically loads system framework and deletes internal module metadata; this is typical for bindings but could be misused if misrepresented. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code appears.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up framework bindings by importing necessary modules and calling objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr with specific framework paths. It dynamically assigns __dir__ and __getattr__ to handle attribute access. It then deletes a module reference from sys.modules, likely to hide internal details. All actions are consistent with legitimate framework bindings and do not involve user input, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard framework binding setup for macOS's IOSurface, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate initialization code for the purpose of providing Python access to system frameworks.",
