  "purpose": "Unit test to verify the sanity of callable metadata in the IOSurface module",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from PyObjCTools.TestSupport import TestCase' and 'import IOSurface'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; test assertion method used on imported module",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test method is called on a module without data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or malicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a system module, then defines a test class with a single test method that calls an assertion to check metadata sanity on IOSurface. The code appears to be standard unit testing code with no external input handling or network operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward unit test to verify module integrity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present in this snippet.",
