  "purpose": "Unit tests for the IOSurface framework in macOS, verifying constants, types, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports IOSurface module and uses test support functions from PyObjCTools.TestSupport.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Test methods invoke framework functions and check properties; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of expectedFailure and assertions appear standard for testing framework.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing for the IOSurface API, verifying types and method signatures with version guards. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious patterns are detected. No external network communication or data manipulation present. The presence of expectedFailure is typical in test scenarios and not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate, serving its purpose for compatibility and correctness testing.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test suite verifying framework constants and methods; no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
