  "purpose": "Unit tests for IOSurface API bindings on macOS using PyObjCTools, verifying constants and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports the IOSurface module, test assertions, and method calls on IOSurface classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as lockWithOptions_seed_ and unlockWithOptions_seed_ that produce or modify data, but only within the test context.",
  "flows": "Test functions call IOSurface methods with expected parameters; no untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code primarily verifies constants and method signatures; no active data manipulation or external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for verifying the presence and types of constants and method signatures of the IOSurface API. It uses decorators to specify OS-level requirements and tests method arguments and return types. The presence of an expected failure test indicates a known limitation or unimplemented feature. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is static and solely for testing the API surface, with no data leakage, external communication, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite verifying the correct setup of IOSurface bindings. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is purely for validation purposes, with no indications of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
