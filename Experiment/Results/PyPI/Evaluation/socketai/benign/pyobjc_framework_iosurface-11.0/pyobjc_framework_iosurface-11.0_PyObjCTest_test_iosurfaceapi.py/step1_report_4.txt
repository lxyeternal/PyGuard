{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of unit tests for the IOSurface framework, verifying constants, functions, and types.",
  "sources": "Import statements for IOSurface, PyObjCTools, and objc modules; use of framework constants and functions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code only performs type assertions and method calls for validation purposes.",
  "flows": "The code flows through framework constants and functions, mainly calling and asserting their properties without untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is purely for testing framework APIs and types.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically tests the existence, types, and properties of various IOSurface constants and functions, with no evidence of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior. The test cases are read-only, invoking getter functions, and asserting types and values. No input or external data sources are involved beyond framework constants. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of API tests for the IOSurface framework. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any data leaks, network connections, or system modifications. Overall, it is safe and purely for validation of framework constants and functions.",
