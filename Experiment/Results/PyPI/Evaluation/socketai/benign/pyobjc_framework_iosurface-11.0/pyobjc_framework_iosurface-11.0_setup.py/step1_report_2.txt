{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and installs Python wrappers for the macOS IOSurface framework using PyObjC, primarily for enabling Python code to interact with this system framework.",
  "sources": "os and sys modules for environment and path configuration; __file__ for the script's location; pyobjc_setup for the setup function; VERSION variable for versioning; and the setup() function call for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or inputs are processed; the code only performs package setup with predefined variables and imports.",
  "flows": "The code imports system modules, modifies sys.path based on the script's directory, and executes setup() with fixed parameters. No data flows from external sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Python setup script for a PyObjC wrapper package. It modifies the Python path temporarily, imports a setup function, defines package metadata, and invokes setup(). No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. The code appears standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal package setup script for installing PyObjC framework wrappers on macOS. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risks.",
