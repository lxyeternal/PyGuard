{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure the pyobjc-framework-IOSurface package for macOS, providing wrappers for the IOSurface framework.",
  "sources": "Reading the script file itself, importing modules (os, sys, pyobjc_setup), and accessing __file__ for directory paths.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs related to untrusted sources are present; setup configuration does not handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The script reads its own directory path, inserts it into sys.path, then uses that path to load the setup module, which is used to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks: importing standard modules, adjusting sys.path to include its directory, defining package metadata, and invoking setup() from pyobjc_setup. It does not process external data, nor does it contain any code that could lead to data leaks, command injections, or malicious activities. The use of __file__ to determine the current directory is typical. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package related to macOS framework wrappers. It shows no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
