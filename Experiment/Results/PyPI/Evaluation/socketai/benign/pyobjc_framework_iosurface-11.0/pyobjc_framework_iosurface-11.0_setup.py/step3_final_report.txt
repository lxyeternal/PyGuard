{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-IOSurface' framework on macOS using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__), imports modules (os, sys, pyobjc_setup), and defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Calls to setup() with fixed parameters; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Imports and module setup are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It imports common modules, modifies sys.path for local module resolution, and invokes a setup function with predefined parameters. There are no user inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code adheres to typical packaging conventions and contains no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving solely to facilitate package installation. It shows no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments are consistent with this analysis.",
