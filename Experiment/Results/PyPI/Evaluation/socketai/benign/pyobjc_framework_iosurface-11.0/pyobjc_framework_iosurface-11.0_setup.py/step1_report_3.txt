{
  "purpose": "This code sets up and installs Python wrappers for the macOS IOSurface framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the environment (import os, sys), and the __file__ variable to determine directory paths.",
  "fires": "The setup() function from pyobjc_setup is called, which processes package installation; no direct untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or __file__ provide input to path and version setup; setup() uses these to configure package installation. No untrusted data flows into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code primarily performs package setup without any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and calls setup() with package configuration parameters. It relies on established libraries (pyobjc_setup) for packaging. There is no code execution of untrusted input, nor any network, file, or data exfiltration logic. It appears to be a standard package setup script. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for a Python package wrapping macOS frameworks. It does not contain malware or security risks based on its content.",
