{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'pyobjc-framework-IOSurface' package, used to wrap the IOSurface framework on macOS for Python.",
  "sources": "The script reads data from the file system (via __file__), environment variables (through sys and os modules), and the setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup function may execute commands that install or configure packages, but no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted. No network or system modification actions are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the current file path (__file__), setting up package metadata, and invoking the setup function with configuration parameters. No untrusted data sources are connected to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures. The script follows standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os, sys) and modifies sys.path, then uses a typical setup function to configure the package. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injection are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply prepares a package for installation.",
