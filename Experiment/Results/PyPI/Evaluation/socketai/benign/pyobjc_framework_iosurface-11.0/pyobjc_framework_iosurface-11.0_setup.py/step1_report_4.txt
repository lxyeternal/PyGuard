{
  "purpose": "Set up the Python package 'pyobjc-framework-IOSurface' by defining metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory (__file__), importing modules (os, sys, pyobjc_setup), and the __doc__ string.",
  "sinks": "No data is passed to external systems or untrusted sources; no network or file output other than package setup.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the code primarily defines package configuration without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code is straightforward setup script with no unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies sys.path, imports setup tools, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code does not process user input, interact with external data sources, or perform any operations that could lead to security issues. The dependencies are versioned, and the script is primarily declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
