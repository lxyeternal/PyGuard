  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a plain comment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment string, with no functions, variables, or executable statements. All reports correctly identify the absence of any security-sensitive or malicious content. There are no data flows, sinks, or sources, and the code does not perform any operations. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's trivial nature. The confidence score is 1.0, reflecting certainty that the code is benign. No logical flaws or inconsistencies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple comment with no executable or malicious content. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
