  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured schema migration utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from executing raw SQL, which is inherent in such tools but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.2, reflecting standard caution without evidence of malicious behavior."
