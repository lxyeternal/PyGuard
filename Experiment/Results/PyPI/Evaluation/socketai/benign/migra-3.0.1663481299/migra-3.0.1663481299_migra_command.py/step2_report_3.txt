  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the script as a CLI utility for generating database migration SQL statements.\n- No report indicates any suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`sqlbag`, `migra`) for core functionality, which are standard for database schema management.\n- The flow involves parsing command-line arguments, establishing database connections via context managers, and invoking migration methods.\n- The only output is SQL statements or error messages, with no external network calls or data exfiltration observed.\n- The code appears to handle errors gracefully, especially unsafe migrations, without executing untrusted code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are detected across all reports.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating code clarity.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is that the script executes migration logic from external modules. If those modules contain vulnerabilities or malicious code, that could be a concern. However, based on the reports and typical usage, these are standard libraries.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (code is clear)\n- Risk: 0.1–0.2 (low, given the nature of the tool; no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured CLI utility for database migration.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious activity is evident.\n- The low security risk scores are justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the low but inherent risk in any database migration tool, primarily from external dependencies or misconfiguration, not from the code itself)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
