  "purpose": "This script generates database migration SQL statements based on provided database URLs and options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line arguments, particularly dburl_from and dburl_target.",
  "sinks": "SQL statements generated by the Migration object, potentially outputted to stdout or stderr.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> parse_args() -> run() -> Migration methods -> SQL output to sys.stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. The code relies on external libraries for SQL processing. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles argument parsing, manages database migration via the Migration class, and outputs SQL statements. It includes safety flags and options to control output. No use of untrusted input in command execution beyond standard command-line argument parsing. The import of 'sqlbag' is a standard external library for SQL operations, with no evident malicious use. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The flow from user input to SQL output appears controlled and intended for migration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a database migration utility with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a standard CLI tool that leverages external libraries safely. No malicious intent or security risks detected based on this code fragment.",
