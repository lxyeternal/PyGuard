  "purpose": "A command-line utility to generate database migration SQL statements between two PostgreSQL databases, utilizing external migration libraries.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for database URLs and options, external libraries (`migra`, `sqlbag`) for migration logic.",
  "sinks": "SQL statements generated and printed to stdout, error messages printed to stderr.",
  "flows": "Inputs from command-line args are processed, passed to Migration class, which produces SQL statements or errors, then output accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. The code is straightforward and relies on trusted external modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper around migration libraries, handling argument parsing, database connection contexts, and invoking migration methods. It does not execute untrusted code, run external commands, or perform network operations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a utility that performs database schema migrations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for its purpose. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
