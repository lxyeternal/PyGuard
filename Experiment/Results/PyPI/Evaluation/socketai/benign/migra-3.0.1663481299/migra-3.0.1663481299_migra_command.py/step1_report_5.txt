  "purpose": "The code is a command-line utility for generating database migration scripts based on differences between source and target databases.",
  "sources": "Reads database URLs from command-line arguments; reads command-line options and flags.",
  "sinks": "Outputs generated SQL statements to stdout; outputs error messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "User provides database URLs and options -> code initializes Migration object -> migration statements are generated based on parameters -> statements are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious code patterns observed. Uses standard libraries and third-party modules for database migration management.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages database schema migrations by parsing command-line arguments, creating Migration objects, and printing SQL statements. The code uses context managers to handle database connections and options to control the migration process. No code segments read untrusted input data directly from external sources other than command-line args, which are controlled inputs. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All functions serve typical migration management purposes. The use of 'sqlbag' and 'migra' libraries is standard for schema migrations. No malicious code or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard database migration utility without any malicious behavior or malware indicators. It reads inputs from command-line arguments, manages database connections securely using context managers, and outputs SQL statements. No anomalies, malicious intent, or security risks are detected in the provided code.",
