  "purpose": "This script generates database migration statements based on schema comparisons, allowing customization through command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments and external database URLs (dburl_from, dburl_target).",
  "sinks": "Printing SQL statements to stdout, printing error messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> parse_args -> run -> Migration object methods -> output via print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present. No obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries and well-known patterns for argument parsing and database migration. It creates a Migration object based on input URLs and options, then outputs generated SQL or error messages. There are no signs of malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of external modules like 'sqlbag' and 'migra' appears legitimate for schema migration tasks. The script handles errors gracefully and provides useful command-line options without any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard database migration utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not include any hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity.",
