  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'migra', used for schema comparison and migration in PostgreSQL databases.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and configuration data for packaging and distribution.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include data sinks; it is only for package setup and metadata definition.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script is standard for a Python package setup using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package configuration data such as dependencies, package data, entry points, and metadata. No code execution, external data handling, or network operations occur at runtime. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are evident. The long description is a detailed documentation string, not executable code. The script strictly adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely facilitates package distribution and installation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
