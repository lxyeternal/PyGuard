  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for the 'migra' package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data in variables such as packages, install_requires, entry_points, and long_description; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only calls setup() with predefined parameters, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, containing static, well-known package data. It does not include dynamic code, external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All dependencies are reputable, and the code's purpose is clear. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard package setup script, and the reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
