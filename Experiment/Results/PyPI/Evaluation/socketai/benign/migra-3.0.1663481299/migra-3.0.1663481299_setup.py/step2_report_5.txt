  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward Python setup script for the 'migra' package. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling. The code is static and typical for package configuration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of suspicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely a static setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**  \n   No malicious activity is present. The setup script does not execute external code, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscated payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports base their conclusions on the static, transparent nature of the code. No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. All assessments correctly reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis setup script is safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
