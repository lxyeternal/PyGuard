{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'migra' Python package, specifying its metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data, package lists, and dependencies; it does not process external inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or inputs; the setup script only uses predefined variables and static strings.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely constructs a setup configuration for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All data appears static and well-structured. No code injection, dynamic execution, or external data handling occurs. The purpose is standard package configuration without any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It is a benign, typical package setup script.",
