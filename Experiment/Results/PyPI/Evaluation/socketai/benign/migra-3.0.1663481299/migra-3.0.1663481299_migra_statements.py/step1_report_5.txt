{
  "purpose": "Provide a class for managing SQL statements with safety checks to prevent destructive operations like DROP commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'statements' list, which contains SQL command strings.",
  "targets": "The code checks for the presence of 'DROP' statements to prevent destructive SQL operations.",
  "flows": "Input SQL strings are stored in the list; the 'sql' property triggers safety checks; if unsafe, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a simple regex to detect 'DROP' statements, but no other anomalies or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class 'Statements' that manages a list of SQL commands. It includes a safety feature that raises an exception if a 'DROP' command is detected, indicating an effort to prevent destructive SQL. The 'check_for_drop' function uses regex to identify 'DROP' commands case-insensitively. The code structure is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions such as network operations, data leaks, or backdoors. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a safety utility for SQL migration scripts, not malicious or maliciously compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safety utility to prevent execution of destructive SQL statements. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The design is simple and focused on safety checks, with no indications of malicious intent.",
