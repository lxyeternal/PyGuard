{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for managing SQL statements, with a focus on preventing destructive SQL commands such as 'DROP'.",
  "sources": "The code reads string input via the 'check_for_drop' function which processes SQL statement strings passed to the 'Statements' class.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'sql' property that generates SQL scripts, which could output dangerous commands if not properly validated.",
  "flows": "SQL statement strings are added to an instance of 'Statements'. When accessing the 'sql' property, it checks for unsafe commands like 'DROP' before concatenating and returning the statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex to identify 'DROP' commands; the 'raise_if_unsafe' method raises an exception if such commands are detected. No other suspicious or malicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to manage SQL statements, with a safety check that raises an exception if any statement contains a 'DROP' command, which is a destructive operation. The 'Statements' class extends list, allowing addition of statements, and provides a 'sql' property to output the combined SQL after validation. The use of regex to detect 'DROP' commands is straightforward. No external input sources, network communication, or malicious behavior are evident. The exception mechanism enforces safety when dangerous commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a safety mechanism to prevent the generation of destructive SQL commands, specifically 'DROP'. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. Its purpose is to enforce safe SQL migration scripts. The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
