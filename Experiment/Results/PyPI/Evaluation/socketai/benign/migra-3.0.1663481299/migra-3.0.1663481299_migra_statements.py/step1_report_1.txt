{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility to check SQL statements for potentially destructive commands like 'DROP', and to manage a list of SQL statements with safety checks to prevent unsafe migrations.",
  "sources": "The function 'check_for_drop' reads strings to detect 'drop' commands. The class 'Statements' reads and stores SQL statements via list inheritance.",
  "sinks": "The 'raise_if_unsafe' method raises an exception if unsafe commands are detected, preventing execution. No direct sink involves executing SQL within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input strings (SQL statements) are checked for 'drop' commands via 'check_for_drop'. The 'Statements' class holds these statements and can trigger an exception if unsafe commands are present, blocking further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward. The only notable behavior is the automatic raising of exceptions on destructive commands.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pattern-matching function to detect 'drop' commands in SQL statements. The 'Statements' class extends list, adding a safety mechanism that raises an exception if any contained statement includes 'drop', preventing unsafe SQL migrations. The code appears to serve as a safeguard rather than malicious code. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is transparent and intended for safety checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a security measure to prevent execution of destructive SQL commands by detecting 'drop' statements and raising exceptions. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. It is a legitimate safety utility with no evident security risks.",
