{
  "purpose": "Provides a safety utility to detect 'DROP' commands in SQL statements and prevent destructive migrations by raising exceptions.",
  "sources": "Regex search in the 'check_for_drop' function; input SQL statements stored in the 'Statements' list subclass.",
  "sinks": "The 'raise_if_unsafe' method raises an exception if unsafe commands are detected; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input SQL statements are checked via regex; if 'drop' is found, an exception is raised, preventing execution of unsafe commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex detection; no obfuscation or malicious code; code is transparent and purpose-driven.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a simple regex to detect 'drop' commands, raising an exception to prevent unsafe SQL migrations. It manages statements safely, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The regex may produce false positives or negatives but is appropriate for a safety utility. No external data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is low, reflecting its purpose of preventing destructive commands. The code's logic is clear, and the detection method is effective for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign safety utility designed to prevent destructive SQL commands like 'DROP'. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The detection approach is simple but effective, and the overall security risk is minimal. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
