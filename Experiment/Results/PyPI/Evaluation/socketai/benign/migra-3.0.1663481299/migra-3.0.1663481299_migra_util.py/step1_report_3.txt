{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to compare two dictionaries and identify added, removed, modified, and unmodified keys and values.",
  "sources": "The function reads input dictionaries 'a' and 'b' passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write to or execute external data sources; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through comparisons and into returned ordered dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward comparison of two dictionaries to identify differences. It uses set operations to find added, removed, and common keys, then constructs ordered dictionaries of these differences. No external data is fetched or transmitted; no dynamic evaluation or obfuscated patterns are present. The import of 'unicode_literals' from '__future__' and aliasing 'OrderedDict' as 'od' are standard and harmless. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility function without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple dictionary comparison function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a standard purpose and contains no suspicious patterns.",
