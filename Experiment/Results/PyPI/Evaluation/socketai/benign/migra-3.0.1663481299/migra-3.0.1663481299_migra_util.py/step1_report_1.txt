  "purpose": "Provides a function to compare two dictionaries and categorize their keys into added, removed, modified, and unmodified.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b', which are expected to be dictionaries provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the function only processes and returns categorized data based on input dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Reads keys and values from input dictionaries 'a' and 'b' to generate categorized outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Python features and data structures without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future unicode_literals for compatibility, and collections.OrderedDict as od for ordered mappings. It defines a function 'differences' to compare two dictionaries, returning four OrderedDicts for added, removed, modified, and unmodified keys. The logic involves set operations to find differences and common keys, then constructs ordered dictionaries based on sorted keys. No external data sources, insecure operations, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for dictionary comparison with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and not obfuscated.",
