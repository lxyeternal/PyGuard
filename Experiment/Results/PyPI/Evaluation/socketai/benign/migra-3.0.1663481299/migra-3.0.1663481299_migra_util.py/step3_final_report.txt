  "purpose": "Utility function to compare two dictionaries and categorize key differences into added, removed, modified, and unmodified.",
  "sources": "Reads keys and values from input dictionaries 'a' and 'b'.",
  "sinks": "Returns categorized OrderedDicts; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries 'a' and 'b' are processed through set operations and comprehensions to produce categorized outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard Python features with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code compares two dictionaries, using set operations to identify added, removed, and modified keys, and constructs ordered dictionaries for each category. It employs standard imports and straightforward logic, with no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, correct, and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function for dictionary comparison, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are accurate and justified.",
