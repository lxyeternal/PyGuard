{
  "purpose": "Define a function to compare two dictionaries and identify added, removed, modified, and unmodified keys and values.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a and b (dictionaries), and the function's local variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code operates purely on input data without writing to external systems or executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Inputs a and b are read to compute set differences and dictionary comprehensions; no external or untrusted data flows beyond this scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comparison function that processes two dictionaries to identify differences. It uses set operations to determine added, removed, and common keys, then creates ordered dictionaries for each category based on sorted keys. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or external dependencies are involved. The code appears to serve as a utility for dictionary comparison with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dictionary comparison function with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely within its defined purpose without external side effects.",
