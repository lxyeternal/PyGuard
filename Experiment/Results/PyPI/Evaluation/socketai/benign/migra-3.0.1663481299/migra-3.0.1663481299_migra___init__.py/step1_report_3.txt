{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports modules related to database migration operations, including migration management, change tracking, statements handling, and command execution.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; only module imports and definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely imports modules and sets exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules related to database migration and statements, then exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no input handling, data processing, or network activities present. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident. The structure is standard for Python modules defining public API components.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign, structural module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
