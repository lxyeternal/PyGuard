{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or aggregator, importing specific classes and functions from local modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.changes, .command, .migra, .statements). No external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and functions for internal use and defines __all__ for export. It includes a future import for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is purely organizational, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
