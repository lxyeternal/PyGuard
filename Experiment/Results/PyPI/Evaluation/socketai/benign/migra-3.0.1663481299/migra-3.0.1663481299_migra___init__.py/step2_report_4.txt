  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a simple Python module (likely an `__init__.py`) that:\n- Imports specific classes and functions from local modules (`.changes`, `.command`, `.migra`, `.statements`)\n- Defines an `__all__` list to specify what symbols are exported when the module is imported elsewhere\n- Uses a `from __future__ import unicode_literals` statement for compatibility\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - The code only performs static imports and defines an export list.\n   - No user input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or other sensitive data.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as an API surface for other modules.\n   - No external data flows or untrusted data handling.\n   - The use of `__future__.unicode_literals` is standard for compatibility and does not introduce risk.\n\n3. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for a module initializer.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.\n   - The confidence level is high (1.0 or 1), indicating certainty in these assessments.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n   - The security risk score is 0, since there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is a standard module setup.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on the code content.\n- No reason to adjust the scores; they accurately reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard module setup for a Python package related to database migrations. It presents no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are thorough and accurate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0",
