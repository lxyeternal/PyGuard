  "purpose": "This code module appears to be part of a database migration tool, exporting classes and functions related to migration management.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading functions are present. Imports from local modules suggest internal data handling but no external input sources are used here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are evident. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of __future__ import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports and exports symbols for external use. No executable logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution present. All imported modules and symbols appear to be part of a structured project. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module for exposing internal classes and functions related to database migrations. No malicious activity, suspicious code, or security risks are evident.",
