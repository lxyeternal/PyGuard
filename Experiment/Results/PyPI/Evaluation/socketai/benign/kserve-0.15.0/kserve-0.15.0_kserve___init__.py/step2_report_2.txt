  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess their conclusions, the presence of any issues, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is purely import statements for models, clients, exceptions, and constants within a Python SDK for KServe/OpenAPI. No dynamic code, data processing, or external data sources are involved.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is benign, with no security issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on importing internal modules and classes. No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard package setup code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, purely import statements for internal modules, models, and constants. No runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—import statements for models, API clients, exceptions, etc. No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above—imports only, no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that this code is just a set of import statements.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the lack of any security concern.\n- **Confidence:** All are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard module import setup for a Python SDK related to KServe and inference services.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, data leaks, or external threats.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis is a benign, well-structured package import module with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary.",
