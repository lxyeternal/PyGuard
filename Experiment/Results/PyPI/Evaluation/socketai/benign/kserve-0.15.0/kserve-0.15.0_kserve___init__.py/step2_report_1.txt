  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of import statements for various modules, classes, constants, and models within a Python package related to KServe, machine learning inference, and SDK setup.\n- The code contains no dynamic execution, no data processing, no user input handling, and no network or file operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose is to establish package namespace and dependencies, typical for SDK or library initialization modules.\n- The overall assessment across reports is consistent: benign, standard package setup code with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is purely import statements; no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the malware score is 0 in all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; obfuscated code or techniques are absent.\n- **Data flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Scoring and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low (0.5), which is reasonable given the code's benign purpose.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely structural, serving as an import module, the risk is negligible.\n- No external inputs, no dynamic code, no network or file operations.\n- The purpose is to organize package components, typical in SDKs.\n\n### Consistency and potential adjustments:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed; all assessments align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard package import setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. It does not process untrusted data, does not perform any network or file operations, and contains no hidden or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain component is benign. It is a typical SDK setup file, and there are no security concerns based on the provided code.",
