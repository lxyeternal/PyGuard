  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a module importing classes, constants, and models for an SDK related to KServe and OpenAPI.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is purely import statements with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. This aligns with the code content.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard package setup.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, describing the module as organizing imports for the SDK.  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no runtime logic or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Again, an import setup for the package's namespace.  \n- **Assessment:** No data flow, no dynamic code, no external interactions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Consistent with the code.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as structuring imports for the package.  \n- **Assessment:** No runtime logic, no data handling, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Import statements for SDK components, no runtime logic.  \n- **Assessment:** Static imports, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of import statements, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward import statements.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports correctly interpret this as a benign package setup or initialization module.  \n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or assumptions are present that could lead to misclassification.  \n- The consistent scores across all reports are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the provided scores.**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign import module with no security concerns.",
