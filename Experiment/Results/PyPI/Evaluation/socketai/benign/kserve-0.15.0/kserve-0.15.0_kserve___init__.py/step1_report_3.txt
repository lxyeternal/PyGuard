{
  "purpose": "This code primarily imports various modules, classes, and constants from internal files and packages related to the KServe project, setting up the package's namespace and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and sub-packages such as .model, .model_server, .inference_client, .protocol, .model_repository, .constants, .utils, .api, .api_client, .configuration, .exceptions, and various .models modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data or actions such as network connections, file writes, or command executions. The code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code only initializes module imports and namespace setup without runtime data handling or user input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be standard package import statements for a Python SDK or library.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of import statements from internal modules and packages, establishing the package's namespace. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. It does not include code execution, dynamic code, or user input handling. Since this is a typical package setup code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The structure is clean, straightforward, and aligns with common Python package initialization patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package import setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, nor does it handle untrusted input or perform harmful actions. The overall security risk is negligible.",
