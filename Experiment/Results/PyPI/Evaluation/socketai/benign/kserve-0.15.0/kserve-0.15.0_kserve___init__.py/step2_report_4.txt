  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a collection of import statements for various modules, models, constants, and exceptions within a Python SDK related to KServe and inference services.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The purpose is clearly to organize and expose components of the SDK/package, typical for an `__init__.py` or similar module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports consistently indicate that the code is benign, consisting solely of import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws. The code appears well-structured and standard.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.5 or lower (mostly 0)\n  \n  Given the benign nature, these scores seem appropriate. The risk scores are low, reflecting minimal or no security concern.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is purely structural, with no active or dynamic components.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments are based on straightforward static import statements with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0 to 0.2** — minimal, as the code is purely structural and non-executable.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis code is a standard module setup for a Python SDK or package, serving as an import aggregator. It contains no dynamic code, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns. The consistent findings across all reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**             | No malicious activity or code present.                                       |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**             | Code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.                |\n| Risk            | **0.0 - 0.2**     | Structural package setup with negligible security risk.                     |\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is benign, and no security concerns are identified. The existing scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
