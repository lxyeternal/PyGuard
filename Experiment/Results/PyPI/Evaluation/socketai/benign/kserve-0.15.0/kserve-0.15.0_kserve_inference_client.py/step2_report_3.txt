  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a legitimate inference client with secure network configurations, no malicious behaviors, and standard practices.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network behaviors.\n  - Use of SSL options, retries, and error handling are typical.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly conservative, but acceptable given the code's network operations.\n  - Confidence: 0.95 — high.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard, with no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code handles network requests, SSL, retries, and health checks securely.\n  - No suspicious code patterns, secrets, or malicious payloads.\n  - Uses open-source libraries properly.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — high.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis aligns with the code; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical inference client with SSL handling, retries, and secure network communication.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - SSL credentials are loaded from paths, which is standard.\n  - No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n  - Network interactions are typical.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — high.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a well-structured inference client with secure practices, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - SSL certificates loaded from files, standard practice.\n  - No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n  - Network requests are typical.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n  - Confidence: 1.0 — very high.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is sound; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard client for inference with no malicious signals.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Uses standard libraries, proper SSL handling, retries, and error handling.\n  - No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n  - No suspicious network behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n  - Confidence: 0.95 — high.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly conservative but acceptable, given the network operations, SSL handling, and retries.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:** High across all reports, consistent with the code review.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — standard network code with SSL, retries, and error handling.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of inference clients without any malicious intent.**",
