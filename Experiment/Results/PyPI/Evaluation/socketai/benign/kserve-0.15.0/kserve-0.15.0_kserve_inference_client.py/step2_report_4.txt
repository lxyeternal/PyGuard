  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the code's behavior, potential security issues, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides gRPC and REST clients for inference, health checks, and explanations. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; standard secure practices observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malware detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated but still low, considering the code handles SSL and retries properly.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code clarity confirmed.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence in benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no issues. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard network communication, SSL handling, and no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, aligns with standard practices.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard inference client code with SSL, retries, and network requests. No suspicious patterns or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, considering SSL and retries are properly handled.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard secure inference client implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is thorough and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard, secure communication with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — aligns with standard practices.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varied (0.1–0.2), reflecting the presence of SSL handling and retries, which are standard but can be misused if misconfigured. The code appears to handle these correctly, so these scores are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's standard practices and no malicious indicators, a **risk score of 0.1** seems appropriate. Slightly higher scores (like 0.2) are acceptable but not necessary.\n\n### Justification for scores > 0.5:\n\n- No issues warranting a higher risk score are present. The code handles SSL, retries, and network communication securely and transparently.\n- No obfuscation or malware detected.\n- The potential for misconfiguration exists but is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                                         |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                   | Code is clear, well-structured, and standard.                                                    |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1                 | Low risk, standard SSL and retry handling, no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.     |\n\n**Final note:** The provided code appears safe, well-implemented, and free of malicious activity.",
