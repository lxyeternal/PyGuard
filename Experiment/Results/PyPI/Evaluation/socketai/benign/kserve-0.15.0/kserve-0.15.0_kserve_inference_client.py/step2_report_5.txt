  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard inference client operations with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. Use of SSL, retries, and data serialization appears standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, given the standard security features and no suspicious behavior). The security risk score is slightly higher but still low.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard client classes, network requests, and response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. SSL handling is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, well-structured, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar standard client implementation with SSL, retries, and network communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity; SSL certificates from paths are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard inference client with SSL, retries, health checks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. SSL handling from files is normal.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard inference client, network communication, health checks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), all low, reflecting the standard security practices and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code snippets and descriptions indicate standard, well-structured client implementations for inference services.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- SSL certificate handling, retries, and network communication are implemented following best practices.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9 to 1.0) support the conclusion that these are benign.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns or suspicious code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard security features)\n\n**Final note:** The existing scores are reasonable and justified based on the provided reports and code analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, secure implementation of inference clients supporting gRPC and REST protocols. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present.",
