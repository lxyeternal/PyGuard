{
  "purpose": "The code implements gRPC and REST clients for inference, health checks, and explanation services, handling secure communication, retries, and data serialization.",
  "sources": "Network calls via gRPC and HTTP, SSL certificate files, environment variables for SSL paths.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission of inference requests and health checks, SSL certificate loading from files.",
  "flows": "Source: SSL cert file reads / network request; Sink: gRPC/HTTP request transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard SSL handling and network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of inference clients with proper SSL and retry mechanisms. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Network interactions and SSL handling follow best practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of inference clients supporting gRPC and REST protocols. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. The low security risk scores are justified, and the overall assessment confirms the code's benign nature.",
