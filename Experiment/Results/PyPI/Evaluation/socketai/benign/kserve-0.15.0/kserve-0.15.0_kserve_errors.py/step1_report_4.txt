  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and their handlers for error management in a FastAPI-based inference server.",
  "sources": "Exception classes, error message construction, logging, and HTTP response handlers.",
  "sinks": "HTTP response functions that send JSON responses containing error messages.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised and caught, then passed to handlers which generate JSON responses with error details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of logging functions is standard. No external data sources or untrusted input handling is evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes with straightforward string representations, and async error handlers for a FastAPI application. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code mainly manages errors and logs them. No suspicious data flows or hidden malicious intent detected. The code appears standard for structured error handling in web services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical error handling module for a web API with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It follows good practices for exception management and logging without any suspicious or malicious features.",
