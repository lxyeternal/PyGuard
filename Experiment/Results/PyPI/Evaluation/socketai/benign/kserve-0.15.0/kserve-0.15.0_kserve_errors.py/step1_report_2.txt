{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and error handlers for a FastAPI application related to model inference, serving as part of a larger system handling model deployment and inference requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module's class constructors, exception initializers, and logger calls within the async exception handler functions.",
  "sinks": "The error handler functions send JSON responses containing exception messages. No untrusted data is processed or passed to insecure sinks; responses are generated from internal exception data only.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised and caught within the system; error handlers convert exception messages into JSON responses. No external data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks in this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code predominantly handles exception messaging and logging without any obscure or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes various custom exception classes for handling specific errors within a model inference server environment, including errors related to missing models, invalid inputs, and server state issues. The exception handler functions log errors via a logger and return structured JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes. All data used in responses originate from internal exception messages; there are no external data inputs or unsafe data processing observed. The code is straightforward, clean, and aligns with typical error handling patterns in FastAPI-based systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for error handling and exception definition within a web server context. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured and appears standard for a FastAPI service, with no anomalies or indicators of malicious intent.",
