  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines exception classes and error handlers for a FastAPI server, with no external input sources or suspicious behaviors. The error messages are simple string representations, and no obfuscation or malware is evident.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The conclusion that there's no malicious behavior and the security risk is minimal (0.1) seems appropriate. The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues found. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions and handlers that log errors and respond with JSON. No external data processing or unsafe sinks are involved. The reasoning is sound, and no suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The malware score remains 0, and the security risk is low. The report's confidence is high, and the analysis aligns well with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, the code defines exception classes and handlers for error responses. The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious behaviors, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low (0). The report is consistent and well-founded.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the code is standard error handling for a FastAPI server, with no external data processing or malicious patterns. The analysis correctly emphasizes the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware and security risk scores are 0 or very low, matching the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code involves exception classes and handlers, with no external data or suspicious behavior. The analysis is consistent, noting the absence of anomalies or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score is 0, security risk is minimal, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reasoning in each report is sound, with no flawed assumptions.\n- **Scores & Justification:** The malware scores are correctly set to 0, and security risks are minimal. The reports' confidence levels are justified given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:** No unsupported claims or vulnerabilities are suggested. The code does not process untrusted data beyond exception messages, which are safe.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard error handling code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for a FastAPI application, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code analysis.",
