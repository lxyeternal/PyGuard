  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes and handlers for error reporting in a FastAPI server. No external input sources; data originates from exceptions and internal logging.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Error messages are sent as JSON responses; no untrusted data is processed or passed into insecure sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard error handling with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent with analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — very low, justified by the nature of error handling code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; defines exception classes and error handlers for a model inference server.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Error responses are generated from internal exception messages; no external untrusted data processed.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward error handling, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes and handlers for model inference and server status.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Error responses are based on exception objects; no external data flows directly into responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard error handling, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified; no change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above; exception classes and handlers for error management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Error messages are derived from exception objects; no untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical error handling, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Exception classes and handlers for a FastAPI server.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Error messages generated from exception string representations; no external data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard error handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe standard exception classes and handlers, with no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0 or very low) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential concerns:** None detected; the code is typical for error handling in FastAPI applications.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of error handling code, a low but non-zero score (e.g., 0.1) is acceptable, but the current 0 or 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary. The code is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (or 0 if you prefer to be conservative)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
