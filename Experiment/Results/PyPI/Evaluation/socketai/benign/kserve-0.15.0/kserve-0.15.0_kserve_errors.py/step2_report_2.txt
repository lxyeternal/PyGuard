  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and handlers for a FastAPI server, with no external input, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely for error reporting, logging, and returning JSON responses. No data is read from untrusted sources, no code injection, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable. The securityRisk is low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on exception classes and error handlers. No external data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or external data flows. All error messages are derived from internal exception objects.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes and handlers, with no external input or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the code is standard error handling logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The code is simple, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard exception classes and handlers, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 are suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code consists solely of exception class definitions and async error handlers for a FastAPI server. All error messages are generated from exception objects, with logging and appropriate HTTP status codes.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk:** The low securityRisk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are justified given the nature of the code—error handling modules are generally low risk unless they process untrusted data or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to the general nature of error handling modules, but no real security concern)\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for a FastAPI application. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
