  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and error handlers for a FastAPI server, with no external input, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. All exception classes and handlers are standard, and the error messages are simple string representations. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, as there's no malicious activity. Security risk is minimal (0.1), primarily because error handling could potentially leak internal details if misused, but the code itself is safe.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is for error handling, with no external data processing or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The exception classes and handlers are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0. Security risk is low, as the code does not process untrusted data directly.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code defines exception classes and error handlers, with no external data input or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0. Security risk remains negligible.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is standard for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is minimal.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard exception classes and handlers with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code content. No external data flows or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0; security risk is very low.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious code or behavior. The code only manages exceptions and error responses.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** The overall security risk is very low, as the code is standard error handling logic.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (reflecting minimal potential for information leakage if errors are exposed)  \n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, as error messages could leak internal info if not properly sanitized in production)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured error handling module with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
