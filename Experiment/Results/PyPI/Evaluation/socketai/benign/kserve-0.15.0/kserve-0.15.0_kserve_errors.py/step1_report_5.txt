  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and async exception handlers for a FastAPI application, mainly for error handling related to model inference, server status, and unsupported protocols.",
  "sources": "Error message constructions, exception class initializers, and logger calls within the exception handlers.",
  "sinks": "Returning JSONResponse objects with error messages that include exception string representations.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation -> Exception handling functions -> JSONResponse with str(exc).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception classes and associated asynchronous handlers for a FastAPI server. It uses exception objects' string representations for error messages, and logs errors via a logger. No input sources or external data flows are apparent; all error messages are derived from exception instances. The code does not include any code injection, network communication, or suspicious behavior. The pattern is consistent with typical error handling code in web APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception handling for a web service. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code solely manages error responses and does not contain malicious logic or external data leakage points.",
