{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and handlers for a FastAPI-based model inference server, mainly for error reporting and logging.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data comes from exceptions and internal logging.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages sent as JSON responses in HTTP error handlers.",
  "flows": "Exceptions occur within the server; error handlers format exception messages and send them via JSONResponse to clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No suspicious or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of exception class definitions and async error handler functions for an API server. The exception classes store error details, and handlers log errors and return JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes. No data is read from external sources or untrusted input streams within this code snippet. The error messages are simple string representations of exceptions, which is standard for error reporting. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is well-structured, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an error handling module for a FastAPI application, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is standard in design and implementation for such use cases.",
