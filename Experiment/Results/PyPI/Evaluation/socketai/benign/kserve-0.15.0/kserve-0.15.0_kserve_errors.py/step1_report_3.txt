{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and HTTP error handlers for a FastAPI application related to model inference and server status management.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources directly; exception classes accept parameters, and handlers process exceptions caught elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "The JSONResponse functions generate HTTP responses, but do not incorporate untrusted data directly into dangerous contexts; error messages are derived from exception objects.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised in various parts of an application; handlers process these exceptions and return JSON responses with error details. No untrusted data flows directly into sensitive sinks without sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code primarily defines error handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for different error scenarios and a set of asynchronous exception handler functions that log errors and generate JSON HTTP responses. The exception classes accept parameters to customize messages and do not include any dynamic or untrusted data processing within the code itself. The handlers uniformly log the exception and respond with standardized HTTP status codes and error messages, which are derived from exception objects. There are no signs of malicious behaviors, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or remote command execution. The code structure and logic are typical for a web API's error management module, focusing on robustness and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for a FastAPI-based service. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no signs of malware. The code is safe and does not introduce security risks beyond common exception handling practices.",
