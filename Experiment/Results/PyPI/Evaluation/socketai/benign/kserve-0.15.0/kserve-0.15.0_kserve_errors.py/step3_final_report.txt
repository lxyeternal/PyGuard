{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and asynchronous error handler functions for a FastAPI application, facilitating structured error responses and logging.",
  "sources": "Exception classes and error handler functions that generate error messages based on internal exception objects; no external input sources or untrusted data processing.",
  "sinks": "JSONResponse objects sending error details back to clients; no untrusted data is processed or passed into insecure sinks.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised within the application; error handlers capture these exceptions and respond with JSON error messages, with logging performed prior to response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions and async functions for handling various error types, including logging and returning JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The error messages are simple string representations, and the structure aligns with common FastAPI error handling practices. The minimal security risk stems from the potential for error messages to leak internal details if exceptions contain sensitive info, but in this code, messages are generic and safe. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for a FastAPI application, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
