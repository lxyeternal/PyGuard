{
  "purpose": "Configure logging for Kserve and Uvicorn components, setting up log formatters, handlers, and loggers based on default or external configuration inputs.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'log_config' for external configuration input; file reading operations for JSON and YAML config files.",
  "sinks": "Logging configuration application via logging.config methods; output to stderr or stdout streams.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'log_config' (source) leads to file reading or dict loading, which then feeds into logging configuration functions (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors or suspicious patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets or credential handling. File reading operations are limited to configuration files, standard for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging configuration for a Python application, including detailed formatter formats, handlers, and loggers. It allows optional external configuration via JSON, YAML, or other formats, with safe handling of different input types. The file reading operations are limited to configuration files; no user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code does not perform any data processing, code execution, or malicious activity. It relies on well-known Python logging modules and best practices for configuration. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified; the code appears to be standard logging setup code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging configuration setup with safe handling of external configuration files. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to establish logging behavior for the application.",
