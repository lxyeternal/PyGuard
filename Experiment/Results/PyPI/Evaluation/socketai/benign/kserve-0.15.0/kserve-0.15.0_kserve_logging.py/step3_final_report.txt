  "flows": "Loading external config files -> applying configuration to loggers.",
  "anomalies": "Potential risk if untrusted configuration files are loaded without validation, but no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard logging setup, supporting multiple configuration formats. It reads external files to configure loggers, which is common practice. No malicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The only concern is the potential for misconfiguration or exploitation if untrusted files are supplied, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minor potential misconfiguration risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and assign appropriate scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logging configuration utility with no malicious intent. The existing scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
