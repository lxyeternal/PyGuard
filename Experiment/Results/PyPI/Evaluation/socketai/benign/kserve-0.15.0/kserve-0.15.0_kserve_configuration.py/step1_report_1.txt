{
  "purpose": "Provides configuration settings for API interaction, including authentication, logging, SSL, and host management, used by the generated Python SDK for KServe.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for system info, class attributes for configuration parameters, and user-provided inputs for host, API keys, credentials, and logging settings.",
  "sinks": "Uses API keys, credentials, and host URL placeholders, but these are standard and controlled inputs. No sensitive data leakage or unsafe code execution is evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are set during initialization; methods generate authentication headers and host URLs. No data flows from untrusted sources to insecure sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic, are present. Logging setup is standard. No suspicious network activity or malicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical configuration class generated by OpenAPI tools. It manages API keys, basic auth, logging, SSL settings, and host URLs. The handling of credentials and API keys follows standard patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is well-structured, readable, and uses common libraries appropriately. No anomalous or suspicious behavior is found.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration setup for an SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It handles sensitive information securely through controlled parameters and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.",
