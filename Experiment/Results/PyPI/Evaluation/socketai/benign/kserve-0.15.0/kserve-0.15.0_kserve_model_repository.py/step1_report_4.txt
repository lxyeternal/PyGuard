{
  "purpose": "The code implements a model repository interface for managing machine learning models, including loading, updating, and unloading models, following NVIDIA Triton's model repository extension.",
  "sources": "Reading directory contents with os.listdir(self.models_dir) in load_models(). No other input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. No network, file, or sensitive data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input from os.listdir flows into load_model calls, which may process models from directories. No data is written or sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "Methods load and load_model are defined but unimplemented; potentially placeholders. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscation or complex dynamic code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages in-memory models, loading them from filesystem directories. It uses standard os and typing modules, with a clear structure. No user input, environment variables, or external data manipulation observed. No signs of malicious behavior or security flaws such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The placeholder methods 'load' and 'load_model' suggest incomplete implementation but do not introduce risks. The code adheres to standard practices for model management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward model management class with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system, with placeholders for loading models. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are detected based on the provided snippet.",
