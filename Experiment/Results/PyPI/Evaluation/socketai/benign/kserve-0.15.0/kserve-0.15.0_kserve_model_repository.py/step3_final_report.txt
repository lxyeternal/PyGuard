  "purpose": "Manage and load models from a filesystem directory following NVIDIA Triton standards.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(self.models_dir) to list model directories",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed insecurely or external outputs",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> load_model or load -> model management in self.models",
  "anomalies": "Unimplemented methods load and load_model as placeholders; no malicious code or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code manages models via filesystem directory listing, maintaining a dictionary of models. It follows standard practices without suspicious patterns. The methods load and load_model are unimplemented, indicating incomplete code but no malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of os.listdir and directory traversal is typical. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The incomplete methods pose a functional issue but not a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.2 due to incomplete implementation but benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard model repository manager with incomplete methods. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk score is appropriate, and the code can be considered safe.",
