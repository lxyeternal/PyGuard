{
  "purpose": "This code provides an abstract base class and implementation for a KServe model server, supporting health checks, lifecycle management, inference, explanation, and communication with predictor and explainer services via HTTP/GRPC.",
  "sources": "Request body, headers, configuration parameters, external predictor/explainer URLs, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "External network calls to predictor/explainer services, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through preprocess → predict/explain → postprocess, with external network requests based on configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of placeholders and standard libraries is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ML model serving framework with well-structured classes and methods. External calls are parameterized, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code relies on configuration for external service URLs and headers, which is normal. No suspicious data leaks or code injection points are evident. The security risk stems mainly from external dependencies, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of a KServe model server, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The external communication is configurable and standard for such systems.",
