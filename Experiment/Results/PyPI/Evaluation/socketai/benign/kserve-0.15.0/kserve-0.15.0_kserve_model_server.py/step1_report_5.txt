{
  "purpose": "This code implements a configurable server for serving machine learning models using FastAPI, supporting REST and gRPC interfaces, model registration, signal handling, and logging.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse, imports modules, and retrieves metadata. Uses sys.platform and signal modules to set signal handlers. Reads environment variables (potentially through utils functions).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. The code primarily configures server behavior, registers models, and handles signals. It does not include direct data sinks like network communication beyond normal server operations or file writes.",
  "flows": "Configuration arguments flow from command-line input into class initialization. Signals and exception handlers flow through signal registration and asyncio loop setup. Model registration and startup flow through register_model and start methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. No unusual or suspicious code patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are present. The code follows standard server setup patterns, and no external malicious calls are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles server setup, argument parsing, logging, signal handling, and model registration. It makes use of asyncio and threading for concurrency, with no indication of malicious behavior. The functions and class methods operate within expected parameters for a server framework. There are no suspicious network calls, data leaks, or malicious logic. All data flows are related to server management and model handling, with no evidence of supply chain attack vectors or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured server implementation for hosting ML models with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to common server patterns and lacks any suspicious behavior or malware signals.",
