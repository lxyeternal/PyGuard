{
  "purpose": "The code defines a server setup for the KServe ModelServer, handling model registration, configuration, and start/stop operations for both REST and gRPC servers within a machine learning serving environment.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments, external configuration files, environment variables, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Model registration, server startup and shutdown, signal handling, and asyncio event loop management.",
  "flows": "Command-line args → Server configuration → Model registration → Server startup → Signal handling → Server shutdown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code uses standard Python libraries and publicly documented third-party modules for server management and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup for a machine learning model server, with functions for argument parsing, server initialization, signal handling, and model registration. All external inputs are from command-line args and configs, and no untrusted input handling or data leaks are detected. No suspicious code, such as dynamic code execution, hidden network communication, or malicious data exfiltration, is present. Use of asyncio, signal handling, and server startup sequences appear standard. The code seems purposefully structured for serving ML models without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears legitimate and is designed for orchestrating a model serving infrastructure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, as it follows standard server setup patterns without suspicious operations.",
