{
  "purpose": "The code implements a configurable Python-based ML model server supporting REST and gRPC protocols, with features like model registration, logging, signal handling, and server lifecycle management.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, imported modules, environment variables, and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Server startup/shutdown routines, model registration points, logging functions, and signal handlers.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from CLI feed into server setup; server components initialize; signal handlers manage graceful shutdown; models registered and started; servers run asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Usage of standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard server setup for hosting ML models, with clear structure and typical patterns. No malicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation present. Signal handling, logging, and server lifecycle management follow best practices. External inputs are handled via arguments and configs, but nothing indicates malicious exploitation. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Python ML model server with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero.",
