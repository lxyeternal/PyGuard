{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in an SDK and provides a utility function to render error paths as strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'path_to_item' parameter in exception classes and the 'http_resp' object in ApiException.",
  "sinks": "The 'render_path' function outputs formatted strings; no untrusted data is processed for security effects. No data is sent externally.",
  "flows": "Exception classes receive error details; 'render_path' converts 'path_to_item' into a string; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for type, value, key, and general API errors, each formatting error messages with optional path information. The 'render_path' function converts a list of path components into a string representation, aiding in error reporting. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The implementation is clear, safe, and typical for SDK error handling modules. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is detected. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK error handling component with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with appropriate scoring. No modifications are necessary.",
