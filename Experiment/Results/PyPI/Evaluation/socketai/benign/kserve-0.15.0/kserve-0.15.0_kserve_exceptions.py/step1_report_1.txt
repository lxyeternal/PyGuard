  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in OpenAPI-generated Python SDK",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or external data sources",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; error handling only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; standard exception class definitions and helper function",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes for API error handling, including type, value, key, and general API exceptions. It also includes a utility function to render exception paths as strings. The classes and functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external calls, or handling of untrusted data. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be part of an SDK or API client error management module, designed for internal use and error reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate error handling and reporting within a controlled environment.",
