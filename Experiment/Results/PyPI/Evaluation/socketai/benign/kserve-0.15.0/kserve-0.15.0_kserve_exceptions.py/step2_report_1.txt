  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines custom exception classes for handling API errors in an SDK.\n- It includes classes for type errors, value errors, key errors, and general API exceptions.\n- A utility function `render_path` converts error path lists into string representations.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose appears to be internal error handling and reporting within an SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. It’s standard exception handling code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flaws are evident. The implementation is clear, idiomatic, and safe.\n\n- **Scores suggested by reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and risk scores of 0 or 0.5, which seem appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**  \n   All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is transparent and readable.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**  \n   The risk scores are all 0 or 0.5, which is reasonable. Since this code is purely for error handling, it poses no security risk.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**  \n   No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities. They correctly identify the code as standard exception handling.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0** — No security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional Justification:**  \nGiven the nature of the code, which is solely defining exception classes and a utility function, there’s no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores. The code is typical for SDK error handling modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score | Justification                                                      |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious activity or code present.                              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is clear, readable, and straightforward.                        |\n| Risk           | 0                 | No security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.                      |\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe existing scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The reports are thorough and correctly identify the code as benign. No further security concerns are warranted for this snippet.",
