  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the context provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: a set of custom exception classes and a utility function for rendering error paths.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for SDK error handling.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data processing beyond string formatting.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of an SDK or API client, used internally for error reporting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is standard, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logic or reasoning flaws:** None observed. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose and safe practices.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5; given the code's nature, 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; the code is purely for error handling with no security implications.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- No such claims are made; the analysis confirms the code is safe.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code and its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — no security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Estimated scores based on analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes and a utility function for rendering error paths, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
