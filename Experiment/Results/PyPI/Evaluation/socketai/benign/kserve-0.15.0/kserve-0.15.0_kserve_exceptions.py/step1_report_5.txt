{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to OpenAPI operations, including type, value, key, and general HTTP exceptions.",
  "sources": "Input data is accepted via exception messages and optional path_to_item parameters; no external data sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and message formatting functions; no data sinks that could lead to data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Error message construction and propagation through exception raising; no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. Usage of dynamic string formatting and exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes for API error handling, with functions for rendering error paths. It does not perform network communication, data processing, or file operations. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. No code injection, data leakage, or security risks are apparent. The implementation appears to be straightforward and intended for error management within a larger SDK.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of error handling and does not include any harmful or suspicious operations.",
