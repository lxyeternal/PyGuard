  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in an OpenAPI SDK, including type, value, key, and general HTTP exceptions.",
  "sources": "Reading exception messages, class initialization parameters, and method inputs for error handling.",
  "sinks": "Generating exception messages and formatting error paths, which are used internally and for debugging purposes.",
  "flows": "Error occurs during invalid input or HTTP response handling, with messages constructed based on error context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard error handling for an SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, with mechanisms to include detailed error context. Functions like 'render_path' convert error paths into strings for messages. There are no indications of data leaks, external network activity, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, focusing solely on exception handling with no suspicious side effects or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard error handling logic for an SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no obfuscation, malware, or insecure patterns.",
