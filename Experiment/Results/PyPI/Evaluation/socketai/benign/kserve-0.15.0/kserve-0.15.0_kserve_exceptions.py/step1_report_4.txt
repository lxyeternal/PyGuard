{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to the OpenAPI specification in Python, providing structured error reporting and rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from API responses or user inputs when exceptions are raised, particularly via HTTP response data or error messages.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output or external system calls. It mainly processes exception data and renders paths, with no data leaks, network calls, or external dependencies.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised with messages that include data from input sources, and the render_path function constructs string representations of error paths. No external data flows or untrusted data transmission are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code strictly defines exception classes and a utility for path rendering with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes inheriting from base Exception classes, adding custom message formatting and path rendering. It processes data from exception contexts but does not include any external system interaction, network activity, or potentially malicious logic. The render_path function constructs path strings from input lists, which is straightforward and safe. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured for error handling without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a structured error handling module for API exceptions with safe practices and no signs of malicious or harmful behavior. It neither leaks data nor performs any unsafe operations.",
