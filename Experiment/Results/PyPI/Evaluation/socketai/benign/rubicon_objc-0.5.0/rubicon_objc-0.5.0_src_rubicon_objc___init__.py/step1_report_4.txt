{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically retrieves the version of the package and imports various modules and symbols related to Objective-C bridging for Python.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from SCM metadata or package metadata; importing modules and symbols from local package submodules.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data sources or sensitive data sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic import of version info from different sources depending on environment is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code paths. The code appears to handle environment differences gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by attempting to import 'setuptools_scm' to get version info, falling back to 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata' if necessary, which is a typical pattern for version retrieval. No user input or external data is processed. The bulk of the code is static import statements from local modules, exposing a defined set of symbols. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are detected. The structure is straightforward and adheres to common patterns. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package that bridges Objective-C and Python, with dynamic version retrieval based on environment. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It appears to be well-structured, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
