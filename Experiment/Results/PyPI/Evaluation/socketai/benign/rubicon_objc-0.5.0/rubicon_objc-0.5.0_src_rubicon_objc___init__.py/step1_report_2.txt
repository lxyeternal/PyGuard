{
  "purpose": "This code manages versioning information and imports various modules and symbols related to Objective-C and Foundation collections for a Python wrapper around Objective-C runtime.",
  "sources": "Reads environment and metadata for version info; imports modules and symbols from local package files.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communications; imports are from local files or standard libraries.",
  "flows": "Version detection sources (setuptools_scm, importlib.metadata) flow into setting __version__; imported modules and symbols are loaded for internal use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution. The version detection fallback logic is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code safely handles version detection through fallback mechanisms without executing untrusted code. Imports are standard and local, with no indication of malicious intent. No external network, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms are evident. The code follows typical package setup patterns, importing from well-known modules and local files. There are no suspicious code patterns or anomalies. The only complex logic involves fallback version detection, which is standard practice. Overall, the code appears benign and maintains good security hygiene.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script that handles versioning and module imports for a Python wrapper around Objective-C runtime. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
