{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for Objective-C bridging, handling version detection via fallbacks and importing relevant modules and functions for runtime interoperability.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from setuptools_scm or importlib.metadata; imports local modules and functions related to Objective-C runtime and data types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external network or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Version detection sources (setuptools_scm/importlib) flow into setting __version__; module imports provide runtime and type functionalities without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard fallback logic, straightforward imports, no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-aware version detection using standard fallback mechanisms, then imports modules and functions for Objective-C bridging. It avoids dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscation. The structure is typical for package setup modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard initialization tasks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
