  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code handles version detection via `setuptools_scm` with fallbacks, then imports modules/functions related to Objective-C bridging.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution. The fallback logic is standard and robust.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0.2 / 0 — justified as low risk, no malware detected.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code appears benign, typical for such package initialization.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on version management and module imports for Objective-C runtime.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no external network, no suspicious code. Uses standard fallback mechanisms.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0 / 0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—version detection with fallbacks, importing Objective-C bridging modules.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; standard import patterns, no external data handling.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0 / 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Version info retrieval with fallbacks, importing local modules.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0 / 0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; benign package setup code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—version detection and module imports.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0 / 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; standard package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, reflecting no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (e.g., 0.2), but justified given the version detection fallback logic, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a conservative estimate would be around 0.1, primarily due to fallback logic, but overall, it should stay below 0.2.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured package initialization module for Objective-C bridging in Python. No security risks, malware, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.1 to 0.2 (to reflect minimal complexity but no real risk)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's benign nature.",
