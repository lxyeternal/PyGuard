{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically retrieves the version of the package and imports various modules and symbols related to Objective-C interoperability in Python, primarily for facilitating communication with Objective-C runtime and Foundation classes.",
  "sources": "Reading version information via get_version() or importlib.metadata.version, importing internal modules and specific symbols from .api, .runtime, .types.",
  "sinks": "Assigning version to __version__, importing and exporting symbols, and registering modules; no untrusted data handling or external effects beyond normal module setup.",
  "flows": "Source: get_version() or version() function -> __version__; Source: import statements -> module namespace setup; Sink: usage of imported symbols and assignment to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors, and no hidden behaviors. The version detection fallback logic is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-dependent version retrieval, with fallback mechanisms, and imports a wide array of Objective-C related symbols and modules for interoperability. All operations are typical for a package interfacing with Objective-C runtime, with no signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior. The import patterns and the use of conditional imports are standard, and no external network or file manipulations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup module for a Python package interfacing with Objective-C, with robust fallback logic for version retrieval. There are no indicators of malicious or suspicious behavior, and it functions within expected parameters for such a package.",
