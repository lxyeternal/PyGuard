{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and exposes various modules and functions related to Objective-C interoperability in Python, including dynamic version retrieval from SCM or package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from SCM (setuptools_scm) or package metadata (importlib.metadata/importlib_metadata), importing local modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified—no untrusted data handling, no network or system command execution, no sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "Version info is retrieved from external sources; modules and functions are imported and exposed without any data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for version handling and module imports. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script handles version retrieval with fallback mechanisms, importing several local modules and functions relevant to Objective-C interoperability. It carefully manages different Python environments and package states. All imports are from local modules or standard libraries. No untrusted input handling, network operations, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization script that safely manages version info and exposes modules. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues detected.",
