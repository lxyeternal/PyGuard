  "purpose": "Implementation of an asyncio event loop based on CoreFoundation for macOS/iOS, managing timers, sockets, and lifecycle events through system APIs.",
  "sources": "System API calls for timers (CFRunLoopTimerCreate), sockets (CFSocketCreateWithNative), and lifecycle management (CFRunLoopRun, NSRunLoop, UIApplication).",
  "sinks": "Callback functions invoked by timers and socket events; lifecycle start/stop methods; callback wrappers executing user-defined functions.",
  "flows": "Timers and socket callbacks trigger user callbacks; lifecycle methods control the run loop; contextvars and system API functions manage state and timing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows; code is straightforward API wrapper with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with system libraries for event handling, timers, and sockets, following standard platform-specific practices. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior, reflecting minimal security concern. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's interaction with system APIs is legitimate and necessary for platform-specific asyncio event loops.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, environment-specific asyncio event loop implementation for Apple platforms, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and align with the analysis.",
