{
  "purpose": "A minimal, mock implementation of the ctypes module intended solely for documentation and testing purposes, emulating core features without native dependencies or system interactions.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, method parameters, function arguments, class instantiations, attribute access, and function calls within the mock classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, system modifications, network activity, or data exfiltration; functions like cast(), addressof(), and memmove() do not perform unsafe operations in this context.",
  "flows": "Data flows through class instantiations, attribute access, and function calls within the Python environment, all confined to the mock context without external or system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious or malicious logic; functions like memmove() raise NotImplementedError, indicating placeholders rather than real memory operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, purpose-built mock of the ctypes library, designed to support documentation and testing without executing real system or memory operations. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling. Functions like cast() and addressof() are safe in this context, serving as simple wrappers or placeholders. The class structures and functions emulate ctypes features minimally, with no side effects or security risks. The code's simplicity and transparency confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal mock of the ctypes module, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and scores align with its purpose as a documentation/testing stub, making it safe for use.",
