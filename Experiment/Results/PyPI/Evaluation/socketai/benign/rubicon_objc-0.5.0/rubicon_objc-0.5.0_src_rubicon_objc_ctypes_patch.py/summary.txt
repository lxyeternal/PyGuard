  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, advanced workaround for ctypes limitations, not malicious. It manipulates internal Python internals to achieve its goal, which introduces stability risks but no security threats. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The code is transparent and well-documented, so obfuscation score is 0. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), mainly due to internal API reliance and potential crashes."
