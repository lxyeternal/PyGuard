{
  "purpose": "Provide a mock version of ctypes.util with a function that returns the input name.",
  "sources": "The function 'find_library' that reads its input parameter 'name'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the function merely returns the input name without processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows directly to the return statement with no processing.",
  "anomalies": "The function's behavior is overly simplistic and could be used to bypass actual library finding mechanisms, but there are no malicious actions or suspicious code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal mock function intended to replace or simulate 'ctypes.util.find_library'. It simply returns the input parameter 'name', indicating it does not perform any actual library lookup. There are no external data sources, no unsafe operations, or obfuscated code. The purpose appears to be to stub out functionality, not to perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward mock implementation with no malicious intent or security risks. It could be used to bypass or stub out library detection but does not contain malware or malicious behavior.",
