  "purpose": "Mock version of ctypes.util.find_library that returns the input name directly, used as a placeholder or for testing.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the unvalidated input directly.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows directly to the return, with no validation or processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward stub with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The function takes an input 'name' and returns it without validation, lookup, or external calls. It is a minimal mock intended for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity means the main concern is potential misuse if used improperly in security-sensitive contexts, but as written, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mock function with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting potential misuse if the mock is used improperly. All reports correctly identify the code as a simple stub with no malicious activity, and their scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
