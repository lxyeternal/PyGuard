  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script automates fetching dependencies via git, building with CMake, and installing, with environment variable modifications. It clones repositories based on URLs, checks out tags, and builds libraries. No malicious code or payloads are evident. The main concern is supply chain risk due to reliance on external repositories.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — reasonable, given external dependencies without validation.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a complex build script, not malicious, but supply chain risks exist.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script clones repositories, builds dependencies, modifies environment variables, and executes build commands. It notes potential risks in executing external commands without validation, reliance on external sources, and possible manipulation via 'spawn'. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified, no malware observed.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — aligns with external dependency risks.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment correctly states that the code is a build script with potential supply chain risk but no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—cloning repositories, building dependencies, environment variable modifications. No malicious code detected; typical build process.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — acceptable, considering external dependencies.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriately describes the code as a build script with inherent supply chain risks but no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cloning external repositories, executing build commands, environment modifications, potential for supply chain risk. Noted that the code relies on external sources that could be compromised but no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly high but considering external sources, acceptable.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — reasonable.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent. The only point is that a malware score of 0.2 suggests some concern, which is justified given external dependency risks.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware score could be lowered to 0, as no malicious activity is evident, but 0.2 remains acceptable as a cautious estimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script automates dependency fetching and building, with no signs of malicious activity. Uses external commands and environment modifications typical for build scripts.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the findings.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious payloads or activity detected. The code is a build automation script.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** Vary from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the inherent risks of external dependencies and cloning from unverified sources. These are reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high (0.8-0.9), appropriate given the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code, backdoors, or payloads identified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — 0.3 range, considering reliance on external repositories without validation, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The main security concern is supply chain risk due to external repositories, not malicious code embedded within the script. The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score   | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious activity or payloads detected.                |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Code is clear and understandable.                           |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2-0.3 | External dependencies pose some risk; no validation performed. |\n\n**Recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate. Vigilance should be maintained regarding external repositories' integrity.\n\n---\n\n**End of analysis.**",
