  "conclusion": "The script is a standard dependency loader that unpacks external archives and loads modules dynamically. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the unverified extraction of external tarballs, which could be exploited if the archive is malicious. Implementing checksum verification or signature validation would mitigate this risk. Overall, the code is safe under trusted sources but warrants caution in untrusted environments."
