{
  "purpose": "Provides a utility for registering and retrieving type-specific handlers within an application.",
  "sources": "The code reads class types during registration, and objects or class types during handler retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Handler registration flows from class types to handler functions; retrieval flows from object or class type to handler function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods to manage a dictionary mapping class types to handler functions. Registration adds handlers for specified class types. Retrieval first checks for exact type matches, then uses isinstance or issubclass for more flexible matching. The code does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle external data. It employs standard Python patterns and is free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The logic is simple, safe, and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for handler registration and retrieval, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are accurate and appropriate.",
