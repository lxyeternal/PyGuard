{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility class for registering and retrieving type-specific handlers, likely used for custom processing based on object types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameters `global_dict`, `obj`, and `obj_type` passed to static methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks; the functions simply return handlers or modify a dictionary without executing untrusted code or performing data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external `global_dict` and function parameters into handler retrieval functions, but no unsafe execution or data processing occurs within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for handler registration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static methods to register handlers for specific classes/types and retrieve appropriate handlers for objects or types. It uses dictionaries for storage, performs type checks with `type()` and `isinstance()` or `issubclass()`, and returns handlers accordingly. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a handler registry without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing type handlers with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs simple registration and retrieval functions safely.",
