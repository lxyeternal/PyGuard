{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with static methods for registering and retrieving handlers for different object types, likely for dynamic type handling or dispatch.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all data processed are function parameters and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leakage points; no output or data transmission functions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only manipulates in-memory data structures (dictionaries) and performs type checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility static methods for managing type-handler mappings in a dictionary. 'register_handler' adds handlers for specified class types. 'get_handler' retrieves an appropriate handler based on an object's runtime type, using type checks and isinstance. 'get_type_handler' retrieves handlers based on a class type, using issubclass. All functions perform straightforward, expected operations for a type handling utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical pattern for dynamic type handling in Python, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for registering and retrieving type-based handlers. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected. The code appears safe and functional for its intended purpose.",
