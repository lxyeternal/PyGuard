  "purpose": "Defines a class with static methods for registering and retrieving handlers based on object types or classes, enabling dynamic type-based handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods: global_dict, obj, obj_type.",
  "sinks": "The get_handler and get_type_handler methods return handlers based on object type, which could be used to invoke code on untrusted data, but no direct execution or external data flow occurs.",
  "flows": "Methods match object types or classes to handlers, which are then potentially invoked elsewhere. No direct code execution, data leakage, or external communication occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses common Python patterns for handler registration and retrieval without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a static class with methods for registering handlers in a dictionary and retrieving them based on object type checks, including isinstance and issubclass checks. The registration function wraps handlers but does not execute or execute code dynamically. Retrieval functions are straightforward lookups with type checks. No user input handling, external communication, or sensitive data processing is present. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a type-based handler registry. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, serving a common pattern in application design.",
