  "purpose": "To generate a structured, formatted string representation of nested code blocks for pretty printing.",
  "sources": "Input data is the Block objects and strings passed to generate_code and generate_code_list functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated code lines and string outputs; no external or untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input Block objects and strings flow through generate_code functions, producing formatted string lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Block class for representing structured code with optional indentation, prefix, suffix, and nested bodies. The generate_code functions recursively process Block instances and strings to produce formatted output. No external data sources or sinks involve untrusted input, no dynamic code evaluation, and no suspicious behavior. The structure is consistent with a code formatter or pretty-printer. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The code's logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign code formatting utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes nested Block objects to produce formatted code output.",
