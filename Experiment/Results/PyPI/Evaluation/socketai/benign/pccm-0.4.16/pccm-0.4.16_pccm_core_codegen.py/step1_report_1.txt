{
  "purpose": "The code provides a structured way to represent and generate formatted code snippets with indentation and optional prefixes/suffixes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes and method parameters, specifically 'prefix', 'body', 'suffix', and 'indent' within the Block class, as well as input parameters to generate_code and generate_code_list functions.",
  "sinks": "The code generates output by joining strings and splitting input strings; no untrusted data or external system interactions are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input strings (possibly untrusted) can be split and concatenated during code generation, but no data is read from external sources or network, and no data is sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears to be purely for formatting purposes. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Block class with attributes for code structure and provides functions to generate formatted code strings. It processes input strings and static class attributes to create a pretty-printed code layout. The functions handle string splitting and indentation without any external data sources, network activity, or potential injection points. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are evident. The code's design is straightforward, intended for code formatting, and does not include any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for representing and printing structured code snippets. It contains no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The risk of malicious behavior is extremely low, and there are no security concerns based on this code segment.",
