{
  "purpose": "The code defines a structured way to represent and generate formatted code snippets or blocks, primarily for pretty-printing or code visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from string parameters within the Block class and function parameters, especially the prefix, suffix, and body elements; it also takes external Block or string inputs in generate_code and generate_code_list functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs generated code lines via string concatenation and formatting functions, but there are no direct data sinks that lead to external systems or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Input data (prefix, body, suffix) flows through generate_code and generate_code_list to produce formatted code lines; no external data flow or system calls are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses typical Python constructs. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code present. No external calls or dangerous behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a Block class that structures code fragments with optional indentation, prefix, suffix, and nested blocks. generate_code recursively processes Block instances or strings to produce formatted code lines, considering indentation levels. generate_code_list aggregates multiple blocks' code lines. The code does not include any network access, system modifications, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility for code formatting or representation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for formatting code snippets into structured, indented strings. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears safe for use.",
