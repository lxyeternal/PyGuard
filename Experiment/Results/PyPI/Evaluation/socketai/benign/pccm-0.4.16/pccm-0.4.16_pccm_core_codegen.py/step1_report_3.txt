{
  "purpose": "This code provides a structured way to represent and generate formatted code snippets with indentation, prefixes, and suffixes for pretty printing.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are used; the code operates on provided Block objects and strings for code generation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or sensitive data handling; no external outputs or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Block objects' attributes through generate_code functions to produce formatted code strings. No external untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Block class to represent code fragments with optional prefix, suffix, and indentation. The generate_code functions recursively process these blocks, splitting strings into lines, adding indentation, and concatenating results. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. All operations involve string manipulation and list processing, typical for pretty-printing utilities. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for structured code representation and pretty printing. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It is safe to use in secure environments.",
