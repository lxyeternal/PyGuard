{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Block class for representing code fragments with optional prefix, suffix, indentation, and nested bodies, along with functions to generate formatted, indented code strings for pretty-printing or structured code representation.",
  "sources": "String inputs for prefix, suffix, and body elements within the Block class, and the recursive generate_code functions processing these strings and Block instances.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems, files, or network, nor does it execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input strings (prefix, suffix, body) flow through generate_code and generate_code_list functions, which recursively process and concatenate them into formatted code lines with proper indentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for structured code formatting, involving string splitting, concatenation, and recursion over nested Block objects. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication, or handle untrusted external data. The logic is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The functions only manipulate strings for formatting purposes, and the class design is simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for code representation and formatting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
