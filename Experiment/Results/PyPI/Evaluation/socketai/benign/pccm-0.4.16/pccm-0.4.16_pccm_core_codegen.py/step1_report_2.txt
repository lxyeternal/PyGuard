{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Block class and functions to generate formatted code strings with indentation, likely for pretty-printing or structured code representation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the __repr__ method of Block objects, and input strings within the generate_code functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs generated code lines as strings; no direct untrusted data sinks are present beyond string processing.",
  "flows": "Input strings are split and formatted into lines, and the block structure is recursively processed to produce indented code. No untrusted data flows into system or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward string manipulation and recursive structure traversal. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data structure (Block) for representing code fragments with optional prefix, suffix, and indentation. The generate_code functions recursively process Block instances and strings to produce indented code lines. The implementation appears standard, with no suspicious behavior or malicious patterns. It does not interact with system resources, network, or perform any unsafe operations. All operations are string manipulations and data structure traversals, typical for code formatting tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a structured code formatter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely processes data for formatting purposes, with no suspicious activity detected.",
