  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec, Path, os.path.isfile, sys.path, environment variables, re.compile",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network or file exfiltration activities.",
  "flows": "No malicious source-to-sink data flows detected. Code primarily performs environment checks and string manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code is standard utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to check if a project is installed or editable, generate unique names, and retrieve qualified class names. It uses standard library functions without any obfuscated code or suspicious network activity. No use of dynamic execution, environment variables for secrets, or data exfiltration mechanisms is present. All operations are typical for project environment management and do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for managing Python project environments and does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It performs environment checks and name management safely without suspicious or malicious actions.",
