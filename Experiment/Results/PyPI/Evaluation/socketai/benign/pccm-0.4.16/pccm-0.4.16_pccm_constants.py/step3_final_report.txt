  "purpose": "Define constants, metadata keys, and a user directory path for configuration or metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input; static string assignments and Path.home() for user directory path.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward constant definitions and path construction with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and a Path object creation using Path.home(). It does not perform any input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data handling. The use of Path.home() is standard for accessing user directories. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code serves as configuration or metadata setup, with no signs of security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. The assessments are accurate and justified.",
