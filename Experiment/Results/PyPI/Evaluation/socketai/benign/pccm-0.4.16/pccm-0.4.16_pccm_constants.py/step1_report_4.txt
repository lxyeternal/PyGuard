{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration keys for a PCCM-related Python module, including metadata keys, a magic string, a decorator key, a path for inline libraries, and a disable flag.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and string assignments; no input or external data read operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines static constants and a path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Path.home() to generate a directory path is normal; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of defining string constants and a Path object for a user directory location. It does not include input handling, external data processing, or code execution. The only dynamic element is the Path.home() method, which is a standard way to refer to a user's home directory. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as configuration or metadata constants for a PCCM-related tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward, with no indicators of obfuscation or malware.",
