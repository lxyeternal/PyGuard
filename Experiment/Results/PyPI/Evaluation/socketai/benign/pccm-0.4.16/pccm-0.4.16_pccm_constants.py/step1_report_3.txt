{
  "purpose": "Define constants and paths used in the PCCM system for metadata keys, a magic string, and configuration flags.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, Path.home() call to determine the user's home directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or data flow points present in the code.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only assigns static values and a directory path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The use of Path.home() is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes constants for metadata keys and a magic string used to identify auto-generated files. It dynamically constructs a path within the user's home directory for inline libraries. All components are straightforward assignments, with no external inputs or untrusted data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be part of a configuration or setup module for a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up constants and a user directory path for the PCCM system.",
