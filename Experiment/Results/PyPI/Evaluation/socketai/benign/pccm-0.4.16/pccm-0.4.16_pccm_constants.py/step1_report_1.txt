  "purpose": "Define constants and file paths used in the PCCM code generation and metadata management",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and a Path object creation using user's home directory",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; constants are static",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; use of Path.home() is standard for user directory access",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets constant variables and a file path for internal use. No input/output operations, network activities, or dynamic code execution are present. The Path object is constructed using standard library functions. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code appears to serve as configuration or metadata keys for a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of constant definitions and a user directory path setup. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. It is a standard setup for a Python project.",
