  "purpose": "Define constants and file path variables used for metadata, auto-generation notices, and configuration within a PCCM-related Python module.",
  "sources": "Constants and variable assignments; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only internal variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constant strings and a file path using standard Python constructs. It uses Path.home() for user directory resolution, which is common for configuration or cache storage. The string values seem to be metadata keys and auto-generated file notices. There are no inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling present. The code appears straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration or metadata constants without any malicious or security-compromising elements. It appears to be part of a larger system for managing PCCM-related metadata and files.",
