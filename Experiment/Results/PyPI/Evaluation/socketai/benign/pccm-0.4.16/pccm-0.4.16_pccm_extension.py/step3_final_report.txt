  "purpose": "Build extension classes for C++/Python bindings with filesystem operations and optional user-defined callback.",
  "sources": "Paths from parameters such as ext.out_path, build directories, and user-supplied extcallback.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications (rmtree, copy, copytree), execution of extcallback which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Input paths and parameters flow into filesystem operations and into extcallback, which can execute code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extcallback allows arbitrary code execution; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build operations with filesystem cleanup and copying. The primary security concern is the extcallback parameter, which can execute arbitrary code if malicious code is passed. No network activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The filesystem operations are typical for build scripts, and the code structure is straightforward. The main risk is the potential misuse of extcallback, but this is a known pattern for extensibility. Scores across reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build extension setup with no inherent malicious behavior. The main concern is the extcallback parameter, which could be exploited if untrusted code is supplied. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential for arbitrary code execution via the callback. Overall, the code is safe under trusted usage conditions.",
