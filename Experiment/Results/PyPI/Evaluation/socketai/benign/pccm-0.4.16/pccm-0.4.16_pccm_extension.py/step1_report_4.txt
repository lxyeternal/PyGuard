  "purpose": "Define custom extension and build classes for compiling C++ extensions with specific configurations and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class definitions",
  "sinks": "os.path and shutil operations, file copying, and directory removal",
  "flows": "Potential file and directory manipulation based on extension parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets. Use of shutil.rmtree and shutil.copytree could potentially delete or overwrite important data if misused, but here they are used for standard build procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for customizing and building C++ extensions, with mechanisms for file management and callbacks. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution observed. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. The code strictly manages build artifacts and executes user-defined callbacks. Overall, the code appears to be standard for build system customization without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical build configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs directory and file management during the build process and supports user callbacks. No malicious or maliciously-inclined code detected.",
