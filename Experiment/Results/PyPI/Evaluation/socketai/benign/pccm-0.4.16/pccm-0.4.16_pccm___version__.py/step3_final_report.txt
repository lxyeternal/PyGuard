  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a string to __version__, a common practice for package metadata. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version string assignment with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
