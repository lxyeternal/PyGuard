  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward utility functions for literal and boolean conversion.\n- No external input sources, network calls, or file operations are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code constructs are identified.\n- The import statements relate to 'pccm', a code generation library, which is not inherently malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1 & 2 & 4 & 5:**\n- They correctly identify the functions as benign, utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is accurate.\n- The malware score is 0, which is justified given the code's benign purpose.\n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- Correctly notes that the functions process data internally without external effects.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are identified.\n- Malware score remains 0, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware scores across all reports are 0, which is justified.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n- No issues detected.\n- The functions are simple and serve a clear, benign purpose.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities beyond the code snippet provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign utility module for code generation, with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.",
