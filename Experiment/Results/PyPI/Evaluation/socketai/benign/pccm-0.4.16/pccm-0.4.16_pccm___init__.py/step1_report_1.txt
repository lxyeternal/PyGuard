{
  "purpose": "Defines utility functions for code generation, specifically for literal and boolean value representations.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input or untrusted data; they only process input parameters provided at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks exists in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward utility functions with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules from 'pccm' and defines functions 'literal' and 'boolean'. These functions are simple: 'literal' converts various data types into their string representations suitable for code generation, while 'boolean' returns a string 'true' or 'false'. There are no inputs read from untrusted sources, no data flow to external systems, and no complex or suspicious logic. The functions are safe and typical in code generation contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless utility module for generating code representations of literals. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
