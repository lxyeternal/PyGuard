  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a harmless utility module with no malicious behavior, reading no external input, and no data flow to external systems.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code defines `literal` and `boolean` functions that convert input values into string representations, used for code generation. No external input, no network, no file I/O, no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  These are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the simplicity and benign nature of the functions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward, with no external data handling or malicious constructs.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions for code generation, no external input, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions perform simple data conversions, no external effects, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for code generation, no external data, no malicious actions.\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; functions are simple, safe, and serve a clear purpose.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign utility functions, no suspicious patterns, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous reports; no external data handling, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic. It is purely utility functions for code generation.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n- **Score consistency:** All assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as zero.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Note:** No evidence suggests any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The code is a simple utility module with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.",
