{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility functions for code generation, particularly for generating literal values and booleans, likely used within a larger code generation framework.",
  "sources": "There are no external input sources or data reading operations in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network connections, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains simple literal conversion functions with no unusual or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. The code appears standard for a code generation utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: 'literal' converts various data types to string representations suitable for code generation, and 'boolean' converts a boolean to its string form. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any data manipulation beyond simple conversions. No input handling, network operations, or system commands are used. The code structure and content are consistent with a typical utility module. No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for literal conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides helper functions for code generation purposes.",
