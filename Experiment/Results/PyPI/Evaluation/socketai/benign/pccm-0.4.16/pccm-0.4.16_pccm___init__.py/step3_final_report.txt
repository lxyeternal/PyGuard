  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting Python literals and booleans into string representations for code generation.",
  "sources": "Function arguments 'val' in 'literal' and 'boolean' functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Input values are processed within functions, no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions are straightforward and serve a clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions for code generation, converting values to strings. No external input reading, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The functions are safe, with no obfuscation or security risks. Import statements relate to 'pccm', a code generation library, which is not inherently malicious. The code is minimal and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
