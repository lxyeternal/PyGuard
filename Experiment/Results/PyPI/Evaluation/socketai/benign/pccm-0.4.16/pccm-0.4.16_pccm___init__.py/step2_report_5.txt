  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines utility functions `literal(val)` and `boolean(val)` for converting Python data types into string representations suitable for code generation.\n- Imports multiple modules from 'pccm', which is a code generation/binding library.\n- The functions are straightforward, with no external input reading, no network or file operations, and no suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for code generation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the functions are simple, safe, and do not read external data or have malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Both are 0, which aligns with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, utility functions for literals.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate, no external input or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk at 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for handling literals and booleans, related to 'pccm'.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that functions are simple conversions without external effects.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk at 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for code generation.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; functions are straightforward with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk at 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions for code templating.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk at 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected. The functions are simple, standard utility functions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, reflecting no malicious intent.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code is a safe, benign utility module with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.",
