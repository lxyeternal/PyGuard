  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward utility functions for literal conversion and imports related to 'pccm' for code generation.\n- No external input sources, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The functions are simple, with clear purposes, and do not perform any dangerous operations.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The functions 'literal' and 'boolean' are implemented correctly for their intended purpose.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code logic.\n   - The code snippets do not perform any untrusted input handling, external system calls, or data leaks.\n\n2. **Malware and security risk assessment:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code is purely utility functions with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n   - The overall security risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n   - The malware scores are 0, justified by the lack of malicious content.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, matching the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and suitable for its purpose.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are unjustified.\n   - The functions are simple and safe; no further scrutiny needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a safe, benign utility module for code generation.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- Scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No modifications needed; the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's security profile.",
