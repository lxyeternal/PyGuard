{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility functions for handling literals and booleans, likely for use in code generation or bindings, using the 'pccm' library.",
  "sources": "None identified; no input or external data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data leaks or malicious actions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions are simple utilities without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains straightforward utility functions with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'literal' converts values into string representations, handling booleans, strings, and other types; 'boolean' converts a boolean value into a string 'true' or 'false'. There are no external data sources, no command executions, no network interactions, nor any suspicious code constructs. The import statements relate to the 'pccm' library, which is for code generation/bindings, not inherently malicious. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of benign utility functions for literal conversions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for code generation purposes.",
