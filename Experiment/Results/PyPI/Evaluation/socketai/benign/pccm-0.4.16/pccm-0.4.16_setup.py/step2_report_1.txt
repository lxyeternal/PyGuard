  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script reading version info, README, environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes system commands via `os.system` for build, upload, and git tagging.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code. Use of `os.system` is typical but could be risky if inputs are manipulated—however, inputs here are controlled or static.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard packaging script.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, given the context)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build/upload with `os.system`.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no secrets, typical use of `os.system`.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup script, with caution advised on `os.system` but no malicious intent.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (still low, but slightly higher due to the use of `os.system`)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar observations: environment variables, `os.system` for build/upload, no suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis:** Same as above; typical packaging script, controlled inputs, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Again, standard setup with environment variables, `os.system` commands, no secrets or backdoors.  \n- **Analysis:** Use of `os.system` is noted but typical; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard script.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same pattern: environment variables, `os.system` commands, no malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical packaging script, controlled inputs, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None detected. All reports confirm that the script is a standard packaging utility with no malware, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security Risks:** Use of `os.system` is common but can be risky if inputs are manipulated. Here, inputs are controlled, and no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. Risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting typical concerns with executing system commands but no actual threat.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scripts are standard and safe for their purpose.\n- The use of `os.system` could be improved by switching to `subprocess` with input validation for enhanced security, but this does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation or malware is present.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard caution with system commands, but nothing malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical setup and deployment script with no malicious or obfuscated components. The slight risk score accounts for the use of `os.system`, but overall, it is safe and legitimate.",
