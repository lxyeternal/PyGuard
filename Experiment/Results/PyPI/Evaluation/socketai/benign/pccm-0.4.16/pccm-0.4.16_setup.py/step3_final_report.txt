  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging and distribution, handling versioning, README inclusion, and upload process.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'version.txt' and environment variables; reads README.md; executes shell commands via os.system for build, upload, and git tagging.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing build, upload, and git commands; environment variable 'PCCM_VERSION_SUFFIX' influencing version suffix.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and file reads serve as sources; os.system commands are sinks; version info flows from file/env to version file and build/upload commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity. Use of os.system is typical but could be risky if inputs are manipulated; however, inputs are controlled.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical packaging tasks: reading version info, updating version files, and executing build/upload commands. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. Use of os.system is standard but warrants caution; no obfuscation or suspicious logic detected. Environment variables are used in a controlled manner. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of os.system introduces minimal security risk given controlled inputs. Scores are consistent: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1-0.2.",
