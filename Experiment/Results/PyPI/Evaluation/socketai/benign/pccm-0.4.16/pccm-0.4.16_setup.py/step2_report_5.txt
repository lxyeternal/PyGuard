  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the script as a standard setup utility for packaging and distributing a Python project ('pccm').\n- They identify the script's functions: reading version info, handling environment variables, executing build/upload commands via `os.system`, and pushing git tags.\n- None report any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external connections.\n- All recognize that `os.system` is used to run shell commands, which can be a security concern if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, inputs are controlled or internal.\n- The overall conclusion from all reports is that the script appears to be a legitimate, typical packaging script with no malicious intent or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code performs standard package setup and upload operations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Use of `os.system`?**  \n  Yes, but this is common in such scripts. While potentially risky if inputs are compromised, the script controls inputs (fixed commands, environment variables), and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials?**  \n  No. No such secrets are found.\n\n- **Obfuscated code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Malware or malicious intent?**  \n  No. All reports agree on this.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Given the absence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors, **malware score should be 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  No obfuscation detected, so **obfuscated score should be 0**.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The only concern is the use of `os.system` for executing shell commands, which could be risky if environment variables or external inputs are maliciously manipulated. However, in this context, inputs are controlled, and no malicious activity is present.  \n  Therefore, a **risk score of around 0.1–0.2** seems appropriate, reflecting minimal but acknowledged potential risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric            | Suggested Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | **0**             | No malicious activity or indicators detected.              |\n| Obfuscated        | **0**             | Code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation.             |\n| Security Risk     | **0.1–0.2**       | Use of `os.system` is standard but could be risky if inputs are compromised; overall, low risk given controlled inputs. |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent: the script is a typical, legitimate setup utility.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n- The use of `os.system` warrants caution but is standard in such scripts and does not indicate malicious intent here.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign script with minimal inherent security risk due to the use of system calls, which is common and controlled in this context.",
