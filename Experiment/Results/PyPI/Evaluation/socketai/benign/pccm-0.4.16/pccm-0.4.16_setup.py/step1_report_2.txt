  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pccm' Python module, including build and upload commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PCCM_VERSION_SUFFIX), files ('README.md', 'version.txt', '__version__.py'), system commands (os.system calls for build, upload, git tagging).",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing shell commands for build, upload, git tagging; writing to version file.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PCCM_VERSION_SUFFIX' influences version string; setup process invokes system commands for build and upload; version info written to file; git commands executed via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for executing shell commands, which can be risky if inputs are manipulated; no validation or sanitization of environment variables or external inputs; no obvious malicious code or backdoors; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard package setup operations: reading files, configuring build, and executing system commands for publishing. It uses environment variables to modify versioning but does not incorporate any user input directly into system commands without sanitization. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of os.system is common but can pose security risks if inputs are compromised; however, in this context, the inputs are controlled or internal. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup and deployment script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Its use of os.system warrants caution but is typical for such scripts. No backdoors, data leaks, or malware are detected.",
