  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or behavior:**  \n   All reports conclude that the script is a standard setup utility with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code relies on common practices like executing system commands via `os.system`, which is typical in such scripts, although it can pose security risks if inputs are manipulated.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or logical mistakes:**  \n   - No evident logical errors or bugs are identified.  \n   - The use of `os.system` instead of more secure alternatives like `subprocess` is noted but is standard in many packaging scripts.  \n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.  \n   - The environment variables and file reads are straightforward and controlled.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical risks associated with executing system commands without input validation.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n   - The reliance on environment variables (`PCCM_VERSION_SUFFIX`) and external commands (`os.system`) could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated maliciously, but in a controlled build environment, this is generally acceptable.  \n   - No indication of any code that could be used for malicious purposes like network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis; malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, and risk is low.\n\n**Summary and my expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (standard packaging script risks, mainly related to use of `os.system` and environment variables, but no active threats)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe script is a typical, well-structured Python packaging utility with no malicious intent or behavior. The use of `os.system` warrants caution but is common in such scripts and does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Consider replacing `os.system` with `subprocess.run` for better security and control.  \n- Validate environment variables if they influence critical commands.  \n- Ensure external inputs are sanitized if the script is used in less controlled environments.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2 (due to system command execution but not malicious)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and standard functionality.",
