{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup utility for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'pccm'. It handles package metadata, versioning, and upload commands.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PCCM_VERSION_SUFFIX), reads version info from 'version.txt', reads package description from 'README.md', and reads/writes version info in '__version__.py'.",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands via os.system for building, uploading, and tagging via 'setup.py' commands and 'git'.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or version file -> version string; version string -> version file; os.system calls -> build/upload/push commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of os.system for executing system commands, which could be misused if parameters were dynamic, but here they are mostly static or controlled. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The upload process invokes 'twine' and 'git' commands without user prompts, but these are standard for packaging workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup and deployment procedures: reading package info, versioning, and providing a custom 'upload' command that cleans previous builds, creates new distributions, uploads to PyPI, and pushes git tags. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of os.system is typical in setup scripts, and parameters are static or controlled. The script does not contain any hidden or suspicious logic. It focuses solely on package management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard packaging script with no indications of malicious intent. It manages versioning and publishing workflows safely. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are detected. The script is consistent with typical Python package distribution scripts.",
