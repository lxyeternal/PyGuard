{
  "purpose": "The code runs static commands related to PCCM build and code generation tools; it appears to be a simple script for build automation.",
  "sources": "The static command strings 'pccm xxx.yyy.Class -o xxx.so --shared' and 'pccm-gen xxx.yyy.Class1 xxx.yyy.Class2 xxx.yyy.Class3 --output_dir .' are hardcoded; the 'fire' library is imported but not used.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; no runtime data handling or external data sources are involved.",
  "flows": "The code does not process any input; it only defines static commands, so no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "The 'fire' library is imported but not utilized, which is unnecessary but not malicious; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static command strings for build and code generation, with an unused import of 'fire'. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling is present. The commands are straightforward and do not pose security risks. The import of 'fire' does not introduce any risk since it is not used for dynamic command execution. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a static, benign build helper with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores should reflect this minimal risk.",
