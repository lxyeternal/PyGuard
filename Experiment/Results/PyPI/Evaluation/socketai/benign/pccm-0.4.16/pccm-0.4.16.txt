The main concern is the extcallback parameter, which could be exploited if untrusted code is supplied. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential for arbitrary code execution via the callback. Overall, the code is safe under trusted usage conditions."
