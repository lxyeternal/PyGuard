  "purpose": "Helper functions for type verification, object export, method assignment, and docstring extension in a Python library.",
  "sources": "import statements, verify_* functions, export function, method_of decorator, extend_docstring decorator",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling or insecure data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions perform type checks and object manipulations without external input processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The export decorator modifies __module__ and __all__, which is typical for API exposure. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for argument type and subclass verification, and for exporting objects into a public API, along with decorators for method injection and docstring extension. No input/output handling of external or untrusted data, nor network, filesystem, or environment variable interactions are present. The code performs straightforward operations such as attribute modifications, list appending, and function decoration, all within expected and benign patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard helper functions and decorators with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process or leak data, nor does it contain backdoors or malware indicators.",
