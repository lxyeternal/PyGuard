  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the security implications and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions for type validation and module export management. No external untrusted input is involved.\n- **Analysis:** Functions use `inspect` for error reporting, which is standard. No malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code, safe for use.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate, no security concern)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with module attribute modifications.\n- **Analysis:** No external data handling, no code injection, no obfuscation. The `export` function modifies `__all__` and `__module__`, which could be misused but is common in API design.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, benign code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with focus on type validation and module attribute modifications.\n- **Analysis:** The `export` function manipulates `__module__` and `__all__`, which could be used to mask object origins, but this is a common pattern for API exposure. No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, safe utility code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly higher, but given the nature of the code, this can be considered a minimal security risk (e.g., potential for masking object origins). Still, it’s not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.2 is slightly conservative but acceptable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for type validation, exporting, and docstring management.\n- **Analysis:** No external data handling, no network or filesystem activity, no obfuscation. The functions modify module attributes and decorate functions, which are standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Very low, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, no external untrusted input.\n- **Analysis:** No code injection, no obfuscation, no external data leaks. The modifications to `__all__` and `__module__` are typical for API exposure.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated but still within acceptable bounds for such patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are acceptable given the module's pattern of modifying `__all__` and `__module__`, which could be misused in some contexts but are standard for API exposure.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a benign utility module with no security threats or malicious activity. The minor security risk scores are acceptable considering the module's purpose and patterns.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the potential for misuse in masking object origins, but overall very low)\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' conclusions and scoring are appropriate.",
