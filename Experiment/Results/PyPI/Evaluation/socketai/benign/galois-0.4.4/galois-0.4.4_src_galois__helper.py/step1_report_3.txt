{
  "purpose": "Provide various helper functions for type verification, exporting objects, method decoration, and docstring extension within a Python library.",
  "sources": "Input arguments for functions, module attributes, function code context, and class/object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages, modifications to __module__ and __all__, and docstrings; no direct data leaks or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are verified via type or value checks; the 'export' function modifies module attributes; decorators modify function attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The 'export' function changes __module__ and appends to __all__, which can mask the origin of objects but is a common pattern; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type and value validation, object exporting, method injection, and docstring management. No external data access or network activity. The 'export' function manipulates module attributes for public API exposure but does not introduce malicious behavior. The other functions are standard utility patterns. No anomalies indicative of malicious intent or sabotage are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses common patterns for type verification, object exporting, and docstring management without any suspicious side effects or external interactions.",
