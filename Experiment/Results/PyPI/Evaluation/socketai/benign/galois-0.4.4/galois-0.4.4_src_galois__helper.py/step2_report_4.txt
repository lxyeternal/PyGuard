  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, with no malicious activity, no external data handling, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues detected. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions, no malicious intent, and no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slight mention of potential misuse of __all__ is benign; such patterns are common.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard utility functions, no malicious activity, but notes that modifying __module__ and __all__ could potentially be misused to obscure exports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.2 is slightly higher but still low, considering the code's benign nature. The malware score remains 0.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, given the code's purpose and the minor concern about export manipulation. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; no external data or malicious behavior. Focuses on internal utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the benign nature. The malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustment needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard helper functions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. No external data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher risk score reflects the minor concern about modifying __module__ and __all__, but overall, the code remains safe.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified based on the export function manipulating module attributes, which could be misused in a malicious context, but in this benign utility code, it's acceptable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (average around 0.15)\n\n**Summary:** The current scoring across reports is reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No significant security concerns are present.",
