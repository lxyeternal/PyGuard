  "purpose": "Utility functions for type validation, module export management, method injection, and docstring extension within a Python library.",
  "sources": "Internal functions reading from the current frame, built-in modules, and sys.modules; no external untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Modification of module attributes (__all__, __module__) and raising exceptions; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Type and value checks flow through argument validation; export function modifies module attributes; decorators modify function attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect for error messages, dynamic modification of __all__ and __module__, which could be misused but are standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs internal validation, module export management, method decoration, and documentation extension. It does not process external data, perform network or file operations, or include obfuscated or malicious code. The modifications to module attributes are typical for API exposure but could be misused in malicious contexts; however, in this benign utility context, they are safe. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor risk associated with dynamic attribute modifications is acceptable and common in API design. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
