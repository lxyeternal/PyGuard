{
  "purpose": "Helper functions for type verification, module export management, and method/docstring extension within a Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the builtins module, sys.modules, and the current execution frame via inspect; it does not take external untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations that could leak data or cause effects.",
  "flows": "The functions verify type or subclass of arguments, then possibly modify module attributes or attach functions/methods to classes; these are internal flows without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code mostly manipulates object attributes and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for runtime type checks, subclass checks, and value assertions, all of which rely on introspection to produce informative error messages. The 'export' function modifies module metadata to support API exports; 'method_of' attaches functions as methods to classes, and 'extend_docstring' appends documentation strings with optional replacements. All functions operate within the standard scope of a typical Python library and do not include any network access, file system operations, or code execution based on external inputs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of 'inspect' for error reporting is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility module with no security concerns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of benign helper functions intended for internal use in a Python library. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity and does not pose any security threats. It is safe to use in its current form.",
