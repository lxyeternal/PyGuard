{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for modular arithmetic, including totatives, Euler's totient, Carmichael lambda, cyclic group checks, and primitive root searches, primarily for number theory applications.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as integers for functions; internal factorization and validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or data leaks; computations are self-contained.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used in mathematical operations and probabilistic searches for primitive roots.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random.randint()' in primitive root search is standard for probabilistic algorithms; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard number theory functions with proper validation and clear structure. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The use of randomness in primitive root searches is typical and not malicious, though it could be exploited to cause long searches if inputs are maliciously crafted. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured mathematical library for number theory operations. No malicious or sabotage activity is present. The minor risk associated with probabilistic searches is acceptable and standard in such algorithms.",
