  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of the scores, especially malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code implements standard number theory functions, with input validation, external helper functions, and no malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code appears straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to the probabilistic primitive root search which could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted to cause long searches, but this is a typical concern in cryptographic algorithms, not malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no hidden or malicious logic. The use of randomness is typical and not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the standard implementation of number theory functions, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no significant security concern; the probabilistic search is standard.\n- **Justification:** The use of `random.randint()` is normal for probabilistic algorithms, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is again a standard number theory module, with input validation, no external data leaks, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no evident security issues.\n- **Justification:** The code performs mathematical calculations with no external or hidden malicious operations.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard implementation, no malicious activity, controlled randomness.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to the randomness in primitive root search, which is standard.\n- **Justification:** No malicious logic, just mathematical algorithms with controlled randomness.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard number theory functions, no malicious behavior, no external data leaks.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — similar to previous, mainly due to the probabilistic search, which is typical.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, no network activity, no data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All 0, as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports, mainly because the probabilistic primitive root search involves randomness, which could be exploited if input parameters are maliciously crafted to cause long or infinite searches. However, this is a standard approach in cryptography and number theory libraries, not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** Considering the probabilistic nature and potential for denial-of-service if inputs are maliciously crafted, a slightly higher but still low risk score (~0.2) is justified. The current scores of 0.1–0.2 are reasonable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — due to probabilistic search, but not a significant threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the risk scores appropriately reflect the probabilistic search's potential for exploitation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
