{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for number theory operations related to modular arithmetic, including totatives, Euler's totient, Carmichael's lambda, cyclicity checks, and primitive root calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as integers (n, g, start, stop, method) and utilizes internal functions like 'factors' and 'verify_isinstance'. It does not read external data sources or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The code performs computations involving powers, GCD, and factors. The only output is primitive roots, cyclicity status, or number-theoretic results; no data is written externally or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Input integers (n, g, start, stop) are validated, then processed through mathematical functions. For example, primitive root functions generate candidates and verify their properties. No external untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Random number generation for primitive root searches appears controlled and limited. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present. The code strictly implements mathematical algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements number-theoretic functions with proper validation and checks. Functions like 'totatives', 'euler_phi', 'carmichael_lambda', and primitive root calculations follow standard mathematical procedures. Internal functions such as '_is_primitive_root' and '_primitive_root_random_search' use secure practices—e.g., bounds checking, controlled randomness, and no external data transmission. No signals of malicious intent, data leaks, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of number theory functions for modular arithmetic and primitive root calculations. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious features. All operations align with mathematical algorithms, and no external communication or insecure code patterns are present.",
