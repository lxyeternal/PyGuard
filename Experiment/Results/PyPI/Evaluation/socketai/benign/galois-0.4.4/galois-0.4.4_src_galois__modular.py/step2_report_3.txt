  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores based on the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes functions for number theory, with external helpers for verification and factorization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data leaks; standard mathematical computations.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Uses `random.randint()` for primitive root search, which is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code implements standard number theory functions, with no malicious behaviors. The probabilistic search via randomness is normal in such algorithms.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** (no malicious activity) — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** (clear code, no obfuscation) — justified.  \n  - Risk: **0.2** (minimal, related to potential computational inefficiency, not malicious) — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; functions for number theory, with external helpers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks; computations are mathematical.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `random.randint()` for primitive root search is standard probabilistic approach.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the randomness is typical for such algorithms.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — justified.  \n  - Risk: **0** — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no malicious concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; functions for modular arithmetic and primitive roots.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; uses standard random search.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — justified.  \n  - Risk: **0** — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; functions for cyclic groups, primitive roots.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard random search; no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard number theory code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — justified.  \n  - Risk: **0.1** — acceptable, minor due to randomness.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; functions for primitive roots and cyclicity.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks; controlled randomness.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; standard implementation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — justified.  \n  - Risk: **0.2** — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign **0**. The code is a standard number theory module with no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign **0**, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), reflecting potential computational inefficiency or the probabilistic nature of primitive root searches, but not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minor, inherent to probabilistic searches, but not security-related.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-implemented number theory library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risks are typical for such algorithms and do not constitute security threats.",
