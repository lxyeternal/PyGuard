{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for number theory operations related to modular arithmetic, cyclic groups, primitive roots, and totatives.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from function parameters, environment variables are not used, and external helper functions are imported but not detailed here.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks are present; however, functions perform computations with potential for input manipulation if misused externally.",
  "flows": "User inputs (parameters) flow into various functions which perform mathematical operations; no external untrusted data sources or output effects are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Random number generation is used for search, which is standard for such algorithms. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious hiding. Function implementations align with standard number theory algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-known number theory functions: totatives, Euler's totient, Carmichael lambda, checks for cyclic groups, and primitive root calculations. The use of 'random.randint' for searching primitive roots is typical for probabilistic search, not malicious. All imported modules serve legitimate mathematical purposes. No suspicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No indications of malicious payloads or exploits. The code appears to be a clean implementation of mathematical algorithms, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, mathematical number theory module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It performs standard computations related to cyclic groups, primitive roots, and totatives without any evidence of sabotage or malware.",
