{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for generating, analyzing, and reconstructing linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), including their mathematical properties and algorithms such as Berlekamp-Massey.",
  "sources": "The code reads input sequences (e.g., in berlekamp_massey function) and properties of polynomials (feedback and characteristic), as well as initial states and sequences for analysis.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive outputs include returning minimal polynomials and LFSR objects; no direct data leakage or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Sequences are input into the berlekamp_massey function, which computes the minimal polynomial; output objects (Poly, FLFSR, GLFSR) are generated based on the sequence. No external network or file I/O is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables are detected. The JIT functions use low-level numerical computations but are standard for performance optimization. No malicious behavior or hidden activities are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known algorithms for LFSR analysis and polynomial computation, with clear mathematical references. It uses type verification, structured classes, and JIT compilation for efficiency. No external communication, data exfiltration, or harmful operations are included. The functions operate solely within finite field arithmetic and polynomial manipulations, which are standard in cryptographic and coding theory contexts. All functions and classes serve legitimate purposes in sequence analysis and LFSR reconstruction. No suspicious or malicious code fragments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation of LFSR analysis algorithms, including the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm and conversion between different LFSR models. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured cryptographic utility library.",
