  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured cryptographic utility for LFSRs and polynomial analysis. It contains no malicious, backdoored, or obfuscated components. The data flows are internal and mathematical, with no external or covert channels. The overall security risk is very low, and the current scores are appropriate."
