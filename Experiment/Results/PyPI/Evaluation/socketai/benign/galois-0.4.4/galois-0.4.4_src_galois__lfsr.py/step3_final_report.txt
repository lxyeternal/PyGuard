  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for generating, analyzing, and manipulating linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), including polynomial operations, sequence analysis via Berlekamp-Massey, and conversions between different LFSR models. It is used for cryptographic and coding theory applications.",
  "sources": "Sequence input arrays, polynomial objects, and internal polynomial and sequence data structures.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical computations within finite fields, polynomial transformations, and sequence generation; no external system calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are processed through polynomial operations and LFSR state transitions; sequence data flows through polynomial evaluations and LFSR step functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of JIT for performance is standard and does not introduce security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic and coding theory algorithms for LFSRs, polynomial manipulations, and sequence analysis. It uses finite field arithmetic, polynomial reversals, and sequence reconstruction methods. No external communication, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The data flows are confined to internal mathematical operations. The security implications are minimal, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured cryptographic utility for LFSRs and polynomial analysis. It contains no malicious, backdoored, or obfuscated components. The data flows are internal and mathematical, with no external or covert channels. The overall security risk is very low, and the current scores are appropriate.",
