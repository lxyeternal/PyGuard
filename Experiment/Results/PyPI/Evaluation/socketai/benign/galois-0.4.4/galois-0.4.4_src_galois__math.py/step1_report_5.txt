{
  "purpose": "The module provides mathematical and number-theoretic routines for integers, including gcd, egcd, lcm, prod, and integer root/log functions.",
  "sources": "Inputs are taken from function parameters: a, b, n, k, and b; validated within functions.",
  "sinks": "Calculations are performed internally; no data is sent to external systems or network connections. No evident data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used in standard mathematical computations without involving untrusted sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard math functions and control structures without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of common integer math functions, with proper input validation and standard logic. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are observed. The functions perform well-known mathematical operations with no external interactions. The presence of imports like sys and math are normal for such implementations. No hidden code, network activity, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate math utility module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard computations securely and transparently.",
