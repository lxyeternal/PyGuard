{
  "purpose": "This module provides mathematical and arithmetic routines on integers, including functions for gcd, egcd, lcm, prod, integer square root, kth root, and logarithm calculations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments such as a, b, n, k, and b in functions like gcd, egcd, lcm, prod, isqrt, iroot, and ilog.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; functions perform calculations based solely on inputs without external output or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters (sources) through internal calculations, resulting in returned numerical values. There are no external or network data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution. Usage of standard libraries and explicit input validation reduces suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical routines with proper input validation and no signs of malicious behavior. Functions utilize well-known algorithms and include safety checks. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or external communications are present. The code is designed solely for mathematical computations and does not perform any network or system manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and solely focuses on mathematical calculations. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks within this module.",
