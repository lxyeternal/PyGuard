  "purpose": "Mathematical routines for integer operations including gcd, egcd, lcm, product, integer square root, kth root, and logarithm functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as a, b, n, k, and b (for log), validated within the functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or file I/O; data flows are internal to computations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation checks into algorithms like Euclidean algorithm, binary search, and iterative methods, producing results without external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical algorithms with proper input validation and edge case handling. It relies on well-known methods such as Euclidean algorithm for gcd, extended Euclidean algorithm, binary search for roots and logarithms. No external data sources or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-documented, and uses standard Python libraries, with a helper module assumed safe. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented mathematical utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
