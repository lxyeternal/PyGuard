  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning provided, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard mathematical utility library.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are mentioned.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (`math`, `sys`) and a helper module (`_helper`) assumed to be safe.\n- Input validation appears appropriate, and no external data or network interactions are present.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code implements well-known algorithms (e.g., Euclidean gcd, extended gcd, binary search for log, iterative root calculations). No issues or anomalies are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **External dependencies:** The only external module is `_helper`, which is assumed safe.\n- **Input validation:** Properly checks argument types and ranges.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- The `sys.version_info` check in `isqrt` for Python 3.8+ is standard.\n- No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no file I/O.\n- The code is well-documented and straightforward.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Clear, straightforward implementation.\n- **Risk score (~0.1):** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal concern due to reliance on external helper module and standard algorithms, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code validity:** Confirmed as benign.\n- **Issue presence:** None.\n- **Scores:** The current scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to external helper dependency, but not suspicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe mathematical utility module with no security concerns. The scores provided are justified and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, well-implemented, and free of malicious behavior. The current scoring reflects this appropriately.",
