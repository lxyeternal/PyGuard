{
  "purpose": "Provides mathematical and number theory routines for integers, such as gcd, lcm, root calculations, and logarithms.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (math, sys), and local module '_helper' (export, verify_isinstance). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points involving untrusted data or external systems; functions perform computations only.",
  "flows": "Data flows within mathematical functions, primarily manipulating integers with no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation detected. All functions perform standard mathematical operations. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical routines for gcd, egcd, lcm, prod, integer square root, k-th root, and logarithm, relying on known algorithms and Python's math library. Functions include appropriate input validation and handle edge cases. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, file access, or obfuscated code. Import statements are limited to standard and local modules, and no external or untrusted input sources are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The module contains standard, well-structured number theory functions with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code is clean, with proper validation and no external system interactions. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
