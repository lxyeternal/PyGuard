  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward mathematical utility library implementing functions like gcd, egcd, lcm, prod, integer square root, kth root, and logarithm.\n- The code relies on standard Python libraries (`math`, `sys`) and a helper module (`_helper`) presumed to be safe.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data sinks are involved.\n- The functions include proper input validation, handle edge cases, and use well-known algorithms.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No anomalies or suspicious code detected; all reports confirm the code's benign nature.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; input validation and algorithm choices appear appropriate.\n- **Scores for malware and obfuscated:** All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The **malware score** is correctly set to 0 across all reports, given no malicious behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, matching the clear, straightforward implementation.\n- The **security risk score** is very low (mostly 0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n### Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?\n- The **confidence levels** are high (mostly 0.95 to 1), which is justified.\n- The **scores are consistent** with the detailed analysis: no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious or obfuscated code, so higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The code is a standard mathematical utility, safe and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- Given the absence of any suspicious elements, I agree with the assigned scores.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to reliance on external helper module, but no security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, well-implemented mathematical utility library with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores reflect this accurately.",
