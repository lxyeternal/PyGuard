  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the assessments, and then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward mathematical utility library implementing gcd, egcd, lcm, prod, isqrt, iroot, and ilog functions.\n- The code relies on standard Python modules (`math`, `sys`) and a helper module (`_helper`) for validation and export.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- The functions perform parameter validation, handle edge cases, and use well-known algorithms.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic or reasoning**\n\n- The code appears correct and well-implemented:\n  - `gcd`, `egcd`, `lcm`, `prod` are standard.\n  - `isqrt` uses a recursive approach compatible with Python versions before 3.8.\n  - `iroot` employs a binary search method.\n  - `ilog` uses a binary exponential search to find bounds, then binary search for the logarithm.\n- No obvious bugs or logical flaws are evident.\n- The input validation is appropriate, ensuring non-negative inputs where needed.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned in the reports**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: Very low (mostly 0.1 or 0)\n  - `confidence`: Very high (mostly 0.95 or 1)\n\nThese seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- The highest `securityRisk` is 0.1, which is justified because:\n  - The code performs safe mathematical operations.\n  - No external or untrusted data sources.\n  - No network or file I/O.\n  - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score is 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n- The code is a utility library, not an attack vector.\n\n**Step 5: Address any assumptions or suspicious claims**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified.\n- The helper module `_helper` is assumed safe; no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — The code is clear, straightforward, and well-documented.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — Very low, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard mathematical utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1**\n\nThese reflect the benign, transparent, and well-understood nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the high confidence scores are justified. No further action needed.",
