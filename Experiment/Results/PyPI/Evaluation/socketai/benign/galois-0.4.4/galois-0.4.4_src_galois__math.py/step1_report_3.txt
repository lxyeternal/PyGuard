{
  "purpose": "Provide mathematical and integer arithmetic functions such as gcd, lcm, integer square root, integer roots, and logarithms.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (a, b, n, k), especially in functions like ilog, iroot, isqrt, and gcd.",
  "sinks": "Return statements of the functions, where calculated results are returned based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into calculations and checks, culminating in return of computed values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns; standard mathematical calculations with proper validation and no hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-known mathematical functions for integer arithmetic, using standard Python modules such as math and sys. It includes input validation for parameters, especially ensuring non-negativity and proper ranges. The functions utilize established algorithms, e.g., recursive and iterative methods for square roots and roots, binary search for logarithms, and the Euclidean algorithm for gcd and extended gcd. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity is present. The code is clean, documented, and relies on standard libraries and straightforward algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard mathematical utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It performs safe, well-known calculations with input validation. Overall, it is a benign utility module intended for mathematical operations.",
