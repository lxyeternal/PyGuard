  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward mathematical utility library for integer operations.\n- They emphasize the use of standard algorithms, proper input validation, and no external data transmission or malicious behavior.\n- The code is not obfuscated, contains no hardcoded secrets, and relies on standard Python libraries and a helper module presumed to be safe.\n- The confidence levels are very high (mostly 0.95 to 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of the code against reports:\n- The code matches the described purpose: gcd, egcd, lcm, prod, isqrt, iroot, ilog.\n- Input validation and edge case handling are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- No external data sinks or external code execution are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard mathematical library with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Issues with report logic, reasoning, or summaries:\n- **No significant flaws** are evident in any report. They uniformly describe the code as benign, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- The reports do not overstate the risk; they correctly identify the code as a mathematical utility.\n- The consistent absence of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or external data flows is accurately reflected.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All assign very low (0.1 or 0), which seems reasonable given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**Suggestion:** The risk scores could be slightly increased from 0.1 to 0.2 if we consider the potential for misuse of mathematical functions in malicious contexts (e.g., as part of an exploit chain), but since the code is purely computational with no external effects, the current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the helper module is safe. Without inspecting `_helper`, we cannot fully confirm, but given the context, it's likely just utility functions.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or assumptions about external inputs are made beyond the input validation.\n- No suspicious code patterns or dynamic behaviors are claimed or evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, well-structured mathematical utility library.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, purely mathematical functions with proper validation)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The slight risk score accounts for the theoretical possibility of misuse, but practically, it is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.\n- Scores are reasonable; minor adjustments are optional but not necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Approve the current scores, with the understanding that the code is a benign mathematical utility.",
