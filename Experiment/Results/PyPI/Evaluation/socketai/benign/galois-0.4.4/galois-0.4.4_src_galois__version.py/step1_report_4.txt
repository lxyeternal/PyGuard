  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static version information to variables, which is a standard practice in Python package versioning. It includes comments indicating the file is auto-generated by setuptools_scm, but contains no malicious or suspicious logic. No data input, external communication, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
