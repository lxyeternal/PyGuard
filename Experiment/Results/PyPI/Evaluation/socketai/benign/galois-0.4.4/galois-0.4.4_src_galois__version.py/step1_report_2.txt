  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates auto-generated code; no suspicious code patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version information to variables, which is typical for versioning. The comments suggest it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm, a standard version management tool. There are no input reads, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard, benign version declaration generated automatically by a build tool. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
