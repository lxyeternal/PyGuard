  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same pattern: static assignment of version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions are present.\n- Comments explicitly indicate auto-generated code, with no secrets or suspicious logic.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for package versioning.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n- The code snippets are benign, typical for Python package version declarations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior.\n- The reports consistently assign a static version string and tuple, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity or payloads are detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n- Since the code is auto-generated and static, there is no basis for higher risk scores.\n- The absence of dynamic code, secrets, or external data sources confirms the low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
