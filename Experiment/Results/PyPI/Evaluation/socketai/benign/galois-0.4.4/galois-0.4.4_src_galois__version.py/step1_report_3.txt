  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with static string and tuple values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating code is generated by setuptools_scm; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static version strings and tuples to variables, indicating package versioning information. The comments clarify the code is auto-generated and should not be modified or tracked in version control. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external interactions are present. This is typical for package metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version indicator with no malicious intent. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
