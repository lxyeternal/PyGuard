  "purpose": "This code defines package version information using static variables generated by setuptools_scm, serving as metadata for version tracking.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment of version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments are isolated and do not involve untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, with comments indicating its purpose, and contains no secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static version declaration with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The comments explicitly state the code is auto-generated, further reducing suspicion. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is standard for package versioning metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration snippet with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
