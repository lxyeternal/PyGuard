  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flow, potential vulnerabilities, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard, mathematically sound implementation of prime generation, primality testing, and factorization. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated structures are present. Use of `random.seed()` could, in theory, make outputs predictable if seed is known, but this is standard practice for reproducibility, not malicious intent. The extensive input validation minimizes risks of unexpected behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correctly reflects no malicious activity)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to potential resource exhaustion with large inputs)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No signs of sabotage or malicious behavior. The code is a legitimate mathematical library.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard number theory library. No external network or file I/O, no suspicious data flows. All functions operate on input parameters, with proper validation. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Completely benign, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the functions are typical for a number theory library. No external system calls, network activity, or suspicious behaviors. Use of `random.seed()` is controlled and typical. No signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a well-structured implementation of prime and factorization functions. No external data access, no malicious code, no obfuscation. Randomness is used responsibly, and input validation is in place.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are purely mathematical, with no external system interaction or network calls. Input validation is present, and no suspicious code patterns are detected. Use of randomness and caching is standard.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** Legitimate, mathematically oriented code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; the code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to resource exhaustion potential with large inputs, but no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malware or sabotage)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (due to resource exhaustion potential, but not malicious)\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented number theory library with no malicious or sabotage indications. The primary concern would be resource exhaustion with large inputs, which is a common issue in such mathematical software but not malicious.",
