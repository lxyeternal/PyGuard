{
  "purpose": "The code provides various number theory and prime-related functionalities, including prime generation, primality testing, factorization, and related utilities, likely for use in cryptographic or mathematical applications.",
  "sources": "Inputs are taken from function arguments, such as integers for primality testing, factorization, and prime generation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or malicious effects could occur if untrusted inputs are improperly handled in security-sensitive contexts, but the code primarily performs mathematical computations and does not directly handle external untrusted data streams or output untrusted data. No network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input integers (e.g., for primality tests or factorization) flow through various mathematical functions, such as power, gcd, or prime checks, with no external data output or network transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard mathematical computations and prime number manipulations. There are no obfuscation techniques, hidden code, or deceptive constructs. Comments and function names align with typical mathematical and cryptographic utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements number theory functions related to prime generation, primality testing, factorization, and related symbols. It uses standard algorithms such as sieve, Fermat, Miller-Rabin tests, Pollard rho, and trial division. It does not contain any code that sends data over networks, manipulates system files, or performs other malicious activities. The only potential concern could be if these functions are used with malicious inputs in a larger application, but within this module, all operations are mathematical and deterministic. No signs of sabotage or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured number theory library focused on prime number computations, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It contains no network activity, backdoors, or harmful system operations. It is safe based on the static analysis of the code content.",
