  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured number theory library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concern is resource exhaustion with large inputs, which is typical for such algorithms but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
