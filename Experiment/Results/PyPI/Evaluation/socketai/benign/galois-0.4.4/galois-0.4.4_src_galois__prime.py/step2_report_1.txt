  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's functionality, potential security issues, and consistency with the provided information.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the module's functions, including prime generation, primality tests, and factorization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Identifies use of `random.seed()` and `random.randint()`, which could be manipulated for predictable outputs if seed is known. GCD computations are standard and do not leak data.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The only concern is resource exhaustion with large inputs, which is typical for such algorithms.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** The report assigns malware = 0, security risk = 0.2, which seems reasonable. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified by the standard nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate number-theoretic library, with predictable probabilistic elements that could be exploited for DoS if misused, but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the module's functions and input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious system calls. The functions are purely mathematical.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Uses standard algorithms.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0. The code is a standard, mathematical library.\n- **Confidence:** 1, fully justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is a typical, well-structured number theory module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity. Operations are on input parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No anomalies, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Completely consistent with a standard mathematical library.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks; purely computational.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or unsafe system operations.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard, secure number theory library.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varying, but generally low. The only potential concern is resource exhaustion with large inputs, which is typical for such algorithms.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (resource exhaustion possible but not malicious)\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured number theory library, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The probabilistic elements can be exploited for DoS if misused, but that's inherent to such algorithms and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The supply chain risk is minimal. The code is safe and suitable for cryptographic or mathematical applications.",
