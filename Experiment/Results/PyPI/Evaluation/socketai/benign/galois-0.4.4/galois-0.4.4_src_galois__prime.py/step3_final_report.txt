{
  "purpose": "The code provides prime number generation, primality testing, factorization, and related number theory functions, primarily for cryptographic and mathematical applications.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as integers for prime checks, seed values for randomness, and bounds for algorithms; no external data sources or network access.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications; computations are self-contained and purely mathematical.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used in algorithms like sieve, primality tests, and factorization routines; no external data flows or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of randomness is standard; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood number theory algorithms with proper input validation. No malicious or sabotage code is present. Probabilistic functions like 'random_prime' and 'fermat_primality_test' are typical and controlled via seed. No external communication or system access occurs. Resource exhaustion potential exists with large inputs, but this is inherent to such algorithms and not malicious. The code's structure and logic are transparent and consistent with legitimate mathematical libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured number theory library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concern is resource exhaustion with large inputs, which is typical for such algorithms but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
