  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code provides prime generation, primality testing, factorization, etc., with inputs validated via `verify_isinstance`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Use of `random.seed()` and `random.randint()` in `random_prime` and `fermat_primality_test` is noted, which could be predictable if seed is known. GCD computations are standard and not malicious.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code relies on standard algorithms, with potential resource exhaustion for large inputs but no malicious intent.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; the code is mathematical and does not perform malicious activities. Security risk is low (0.2) due to resource exhaustion potential.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9, as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores are reasonable. The code is legitimate, with predictable randomness and no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The functions are standard for number theory. Inputs are function arguments; no external data sources.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network, file, or external data access. Operations are purely computational.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. The code is a typical mathematical library.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is correct; no malicious activity. Security risk is negligible.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, as the analysis is comprehensive.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the code is a standard, safe number theory library.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, standard prime and number theory functions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious constructs, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard algorithms.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior detected; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; functions operate on input integers.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interactions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no malicious code.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, consistent with a mathematical library.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious intent; code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; standard number theory functions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, appropriate for a math library.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** The code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard implementation.\n- **Risk Score:** The only concern is resource exhaustion with large inputs, which is inherent to such mathematical functions, but not malicious.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)  \n**Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential resource exhaustion with large inputs, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-structured, standard number theory library, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The scores given are reasonable and align with the analysis.",
