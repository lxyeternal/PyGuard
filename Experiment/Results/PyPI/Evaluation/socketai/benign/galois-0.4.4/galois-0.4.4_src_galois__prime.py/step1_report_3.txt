{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for prime number generation, primality testing, factorization, and related number theory utilities.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through function arguments such as integers for prime generation, primality tests, and factorization functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; functions operate solely on input parameters and internal calculations without data leakage or system effects.",
  "flows": "Number inputs flow through primality tests, factorization routines, and prime generation algorithms, with no indication of untrusted external data influencing system state or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code uses standard Python libraries, including random, math, and numpy, and well-understood algorithms. No obfuscated code, hidden network calls, or suspicious data manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard number theory algorithms: prime generation via sieve, primality tests (Fermat, Miller-Rabin), factorization (trial division, Pollard's rho), and related functions. It uses secure practices such as probabilistic primality testing with multiple rounds and caching for efficiency. No suspicious external data access, no code injection, and no potential backdoors are detected. All functions operate on parameters with clear validation and do not produce side effects beyond returning computed values. The code appears to be a well-structured, legitimate number theory library with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive, standard number theory module for primes and factorization, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is consistent with typical mathematical libraries and does not perform any harmful actions.",
