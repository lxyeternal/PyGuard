{
  "purpose": "Provide type hints and data structure definitions for the galois library, enabling type checking and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, numpy, and internal modules; type alias definitions; no dynamic input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communications.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines types and aliases without runtime data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias and import definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type aliases for elements, arrays, shapes, data types, and polynomials related to the galois library. It includes conditional imports for type checking, type aliasing for various data structures, and documentation comments. No runtime logic, external data reads, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is purely declarative for type hinting, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard type hinting and documentation aid for the galois library. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is solely to improve static type checking and code clarity.",
