{
  "purpose": "Define type hints and data structures for the galois library, facilitating type coercion and validation for elements, arrays, shapes, data types, and polynomials.",
  "sources": "The module imports standard Python typing and numpy; defines type aliases and conditional imports for internal modules; specifies various union types for input coercion.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output operations are present; the code only declares types and imports, without external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and alias assignments flow from imported modules and internal type annotations; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code are present. The code primarily consists of type alias definitions and import statements. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a static type hinting module for the galois library. It conditionally imports internal modules for type annotations, defines various type unions for elements, arrays, shapes, data types, and polynomials, and cleans up namespace exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, file modifications, or embedded backdoors. The code is straightforward, intended for static analysis and type checking, with no runtime or data manipulation operations that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured type definition module with no indications of malicious intent or security threats. It purely facilitates type annotations for the library and does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
