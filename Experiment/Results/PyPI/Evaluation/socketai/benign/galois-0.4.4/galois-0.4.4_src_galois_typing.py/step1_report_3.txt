{
  "purpose": "The code defines type hints and data structures for the galois library, facilitating type coercion and validation for elements, arrays, shapes, data types, and polynomials used within the library.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, imported modules (typing, numpy), and conditional import statements for internal classes (_domains._array and _polys._poly).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that handle untrusted input; the code primarily declares type aliases and does not process runtime data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The flow involves defining type aliases (ElementLike, IterableLike, ArrayLike, etc.) based on imported modules, with no data processing or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code strictly defines type aliases and imports without any runtime evaluation, external communication, or data handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely focused on static type definitions, including Union types and aliases for elements, arrays, shapes, data types, and polynomials. The conditional import for internal classes is standard for forward references in type hints. There is no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or potentially malicious activity. The use of type hints enhances code clarity and type safety but does not introduce security risks. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static type definitions module for the galois library. It contains no malicious behavior, no runtime data processing, and no external communications. It appears safe and standard for type hint declarations.",
