  "purpose": "Define type hints and aliases for the galois library to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type hint definitions, imports, and conditional import statements.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Type alias definitions and type hints without data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed. The code primarily contains type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines several complex type aliases using Python's typing system for use within the galois library. It includes conditional imports for type checking, which are standard for avoiding runtime overhead. There are no apparent data leaks, code injections, or malicious constructs. The code primarily serves as type annotation scaffolding, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or secret handling. The removal of imported objects from the public namespace at the end is a standard cleanup procedure and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard type hinting utility for the galois library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely provides type annotations to aid static analysis and code readability.",
