{
  "purpose": "This module provides static type hints and aliases for the galois library, facilitating static analysis, type safety, and documentation.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports for internal classes (_domains._array.Array and _polys._poly.Poly) within TYPE_CHECKING; type alias definitions; no runtime data input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data output or network activity; purely type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static type alias definitions do not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type aliasing and namespace cleanup; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, declarative module defining type aliases for elements, iterables, arrays, shapes, data types, and polynomials used in the galois library. It uses conditional imports to avoid runtime overhead, and deletes imported objects after use. There are no functions, data processing, or external communications. The code is well-structured, documented, and adheres to standard practices for type hinting modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for static type checking and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with its static, declarative nature.",
