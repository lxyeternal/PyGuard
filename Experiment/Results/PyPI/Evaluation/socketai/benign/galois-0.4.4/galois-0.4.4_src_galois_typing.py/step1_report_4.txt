{
  "purpose": "This module provides type hint definitions for the galois library, specifying acceptable input types for various functions and classes.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions and import statements, including imports from __future__ and typing, as well as conditional imports under TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing points are present; the code mainly defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows involving untrusted input; the code only establishes type hinting and annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, focusing on type definitions and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines various type aliases for elements, iterables, arrays, shapes, data types, and polynomials relevant to the galois library. It conditionally imports internal classes for type hints without executing runtime logic or external data handling. No functions or runtime data processing is present. The code includes documentation comments and removes some imported objects from the namespace after definitions, indicating careful code organization. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type-hinting module for the galois library, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It serves purely as a type annotation aid, with no runtime or external data processing involved.",
