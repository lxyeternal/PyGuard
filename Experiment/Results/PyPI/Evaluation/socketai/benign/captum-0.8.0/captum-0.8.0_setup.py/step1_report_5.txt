{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the captum Python package, primarily used for package configuration, dependency management, and optional insights build.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, command-line arguments, version info from captum/__init__.py, and file contents from README.md and scripts/build_insights.sh.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess call for build_insights.sh, reads files for version and description, and sets up package data; no direct data leaks or untrusted command execution identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line args influence build process; version info flows from file to setup; subprocess executes build script if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to run an external shell script ('./scripts/build_insights.sh') which could be malicious if the script is tampered with; no other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks, including version checking, environment variable handling, and package configuration. It conditionally runs an external build script, which is common in build pipelines but could pose security risks if the script is malicious or compromised. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on external scripts for build steps, which must be trusted separately. Overall, the script appears legitimate and typical for Python package setup, with the only potential concern being the external build script invocation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a conditional external build step. The only notable security concern is the execution of an external shell script ('build_insights.sh'), which could be malicious if the script itself is compromised. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling found within this code segment.",
