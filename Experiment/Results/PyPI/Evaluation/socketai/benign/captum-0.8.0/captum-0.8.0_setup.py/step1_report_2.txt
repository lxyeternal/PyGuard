  "purpose": "Setup script for building and configuring the 'captum' package, including optional insights build.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BUILD_INSIGHTS), command line arguments, version string extraction from 'captum/__init__.py', reading README.md, subprocess call for insights build.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call() executing a shell script, reading environment variables, reading files, printing logs.",
  "flows": "Environment variable checks and command line args influence behavior; 'build_insights()' runs external script; version extraction reads package info; setup() configures package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Use of subprocess for external script execution is standard for build steps, but potential risk if the script is compromised. No suspicious network activity or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks, version validation, optional external script execution, and package configuration. It reads version info from a local file, reads README for description, and runs an external shell script if environment variable is set. All file accesses and subprocess calls are typical for build scripts. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Use of subprocess.check_call() warrants caution but is standard for build processes. No suspicious obfuscation, code injection, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with optional insights build. No malicious behavior or malware detected. It uses external scripts as part of normal build procedures, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious payloads.",
