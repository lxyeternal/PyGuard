  "purpose": "Setup script for building and packaging the captum Python library, including optional insights build.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., BUILD_INSIGHTS), sys.argv, open files for version and README, subprocess call to build insights script.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call() executing build_insights.sh script, file read operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> build_insights() function -> subprocess call to run build script.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.check_call() to run an external shell script without input validation, which could be exploited if the script or environment were compromised. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment checks, version validation, file reading, and invoking an external build script. The subprocess call to execute './scripts/build_insights.sh' is the only potentially concerning operation. However, this call is to a local script, and there is no evidence of malicious code or data exfiltration in the provided code. The script's purpose aligns with standard package setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The external script's content isn't provided, so any malicious behavior could originate there, but based solely on this code, there is no direct malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with a controlled external script invocation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or suspicious anomalies within this code. The subprocess call warrants awareness but is not inherently malicious.",
