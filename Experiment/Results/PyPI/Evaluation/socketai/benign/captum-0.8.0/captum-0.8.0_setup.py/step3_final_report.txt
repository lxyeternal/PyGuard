  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the 'captum' package, performing environment checks, version extraction, optional insights build via an external shell script, and package setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BUILD_INSIGHTS), sys.argv, version file, README.md, external script './scripts/build_insights.sh'",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call() executing external script",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> version read -> optional build_insights() -> subprocess call to external script",
  "anomalies": "Execution of external script without validation or sanitization; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with environment validation, version extraction, and optional build steps. The main external activity is running a shell script via subprocess, which is typical but could be risky if the script is malicious. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or secrets are present within this code. The risk is primarily external, depending on the trustworthiness of the external script. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting the external script execution but no inherent malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and standard for package configuration. The only potential concern is executing an external script without validation, which is common in build pipelines but warrants external verification. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
