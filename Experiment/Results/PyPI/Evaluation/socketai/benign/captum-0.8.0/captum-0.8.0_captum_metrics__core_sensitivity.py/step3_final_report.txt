{
  "purpose": "Implements a Monte Carlo-based explanation sensitivity metric ('sensitivity_max') for interpretability analysis, measuring how explanation outputs vary under input perturbations.",
  "sources": "Input tensors, explanation functions, optional kwargs (e.g., additional_forward_args, baselines, target). Reads data from provided input tensors and user-defined explanation functions.",
  "sinks": "In-memory tensor operations; no external network, file I/O, or data exfiltration; potential influence on explanation outputs via user-supplied functions but no malicious data leaks.",
  "flows": "Inputs are expanded and perturbed; explanations are computed for original and perturbed inputs; differences are normalized and aggregated to produce sensitivity scores.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, external communication, or obfuscation; use of deepcopy and tensor manipulations are standard; perturbation method is typical for robustness testing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard sensitivity analysis for explanation robustness using input perturbations and explanation difference metrics. It relies on well-known libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The data flow is straightforward, with inputs processed through perturbation, explanation, and normalization steps. Deep copies of kwargs prevent side effects, and batching optimizes performance. The perturbation function adds uniform noise within an L-infinity ball, a common approach. No external system calls or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an explanation sensitivity metric, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and align with the analysis. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
