{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to measure explanation sensitivity for neural network models, particularly evaluating how explanations change under input perturbations using Monte Carlo sampling. It supports custom perturbation and explanation functions for interpretability assessments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'inputs' parameter, explanation functions through 'explanation_func', and optionally from 'kwargs' such as 'baselines' and 'target'. It also reads perturbation parameters like 'perturb_radius'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include passing untrusted data to explanation functions, which could lead to manipulation of explanation outputs. The code calls tensor operations and possibly user-defined 'explanation_func' with input data, but no evident direct data leaks or external network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'inputs' to the explanation function; inputs are perturbed via 'perturb_func'; the differences in explanations are computed, normalized, and maxed to derive sensitivity scores. The process involves input expansion, perturbation, explanation evaluation, and normalization steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious external network activity, file modifications, or obfuscated code segments are detected. The code uses deep copies and tensor operations typical for numerical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Monte Carlo-based sensitivity metric by repeatedly perturbing inputs and evaluating explanation differences. It uses tensor operations, input expansion, and optional baseline handling. The perturbation function adds uniform noise within an L-infinity ball. The explanation function is invoked on expanded inputs, with careful batching to handle large data efficiently. No external network calls, no file modifications, or backdoors are present. The logic appears consistent with standard interpretability evaluation techniques. There is no sign of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. The code mainly performs numerical and explanation evaluation tasks. The use of deepcopy and tensor operations is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for measuring explanation sensitivity in neural networks. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It follows expected patterns for perturbation, explanation evaluation, and batching. No evidence of sabotage or malware is found.",
