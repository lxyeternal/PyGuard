  "purpose": "The code implements a function to measure explanation sensitivity of a model's attribution method under input perturbations, primarily for interpretability and robustness analysis in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Inputs are read from function arguments `inputs`, `explanation_func`, and optional keyword arguments `kwargs`. Data is also accessed from `kwargs`, especially `baselines` and other explanation parameters. Data flow is also influenced by the internal functions `_generate_perturbations` and `_next_sensitivity_max` which generate perturbed inputs and explanations respectively.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows from the input arguments into perturbation and explanation functions. The primary sink involves calling `explanation_func` and `perturb_func` with potentially user-controlled inputs, which could lead to unsafe code execution if these functions are maliciously overridden. The code also uses `torch` operations but no unsafe system calls, network activity, or file access are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from `inputs` into perturbation generator `_generate_perturbations` which creates perturbed inputs via `perturb_func`. These are then fed into `explanation_func` to compute explanations for both original and perturbed inputs. The explanations are used to compute sensitivities. This process is repeated for multiple samples with batch management to avoid large memory usage.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for an explanation sensitivity analysis. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets are present. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or unnecessary dynamic execution are detected. The perturbation function adds noise in a standard way. Usage of internal utility functions from the `captum` library is consistent with normal usage patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a perturbation function that adds uniform noise within an L-infinity ball to inputs. The main function `sensitivity_max` performs Monte Carlo sampling of input perturbations and computes the maximum explanation sensitivity across these samples. It handles batching to optimize performance and utilizes deep copies and internal functions to manage parameters and expand inputs/arguments. The explanation function is invoked multiple times, with results used to compute norms of explanation differences. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The code is consistent with a typical interpretability robustness analysis tool, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a model explanation sensitivity metric for interpretability robustness assessment. It operates within expected parameters, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The use of internal utility functions and the approach to perturbation and sensitivity calculation align with standard practices. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
