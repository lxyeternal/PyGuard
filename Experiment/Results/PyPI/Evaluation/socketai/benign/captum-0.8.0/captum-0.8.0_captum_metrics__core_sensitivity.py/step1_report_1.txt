  "purpose": "The code defines functions for measuring explanation sensitivity of models, specifically implementing a Monte Carlo sampling approach to evaluate how explanation outputs change under input perturbations. It is used for interpretability and robustness assessment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input tensors (`inputs`) provided to the `sensitivity_max` function, as well as optional keyword arguments (`kwargs`) which can include `baselines`, `additional_forward_args`, and `target`. It also reads from the `explanation_func` which generates explanations based on these inputs. It reads from the `perturb_func` (default or custom) which generates perturbed inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or send untrusted data externally. However, it performs in-memory calculations on potentially untrusted input data, computes explanation sensitivities, and returns a tensor of sensitivity scores. No external network or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (`inputs`) are read and possibly expanded or duplicated for multiple perturbation samples. The `explanation_func` is called with these inputs and optional kwargs, producing explanation outputs. Perturbed inputs are generated via `perturb_func`, which are then explained again. Differences between original and perturbed explanations are computed, norms calculated, and maximum sensitivity scores are derived, flowing from input data through explanation computations to sensitivity scores.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deep copying (`deepcopy`) of `kwargs`, which could be considered unusual but is not inherently malicious. It employs in-memory tensor operations without external data leaks or code injection. There is no hardcoded credential, suspicious domain, or backdoor. The perturbation function samples uniformly within an L-infinity ball, which is standard. No obfuscation techniques or hidden malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a known technique for measuring explanation sensitivity using Monte Carlo sampling, with careful handling of batch processing and input expansion. It uses standard libraries (torch, captum) and typical tensor operations. The functions generate perturbed inputs, compute explanations, and measure maximum differences, normalizing by explanation magnitudes. The code is well-structured and appears to perform legitimate interpretability analysis. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed. Its use of deep copy and input expansion is typical for such sensitivity analyses.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate sensitivity analysis of model explanations using Monte Carlo sampling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions, variables, and data flows are consistent with interpretability research and robustness evaluation. No external communications or harmful operations are present. Overall, it appears to be a benign, well-structured analysis tool.",
