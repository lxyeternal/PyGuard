{
  "purpose": "The code implements a sensitivity analysis metric (sensitivity_max) for explanation methods in neural networks, particularly used in interpretability and explainability studies.",
  "sources": "Reads input tensors (`inputs`) and additional keyword arguments (`kwargs`) that include explanation functions, baselines, targets, and forward arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses the explanation function (`explanation_func`) to generate explanations; computes maximum sensitivities; no data leakage or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs are perturbed via `perturb_func`, explanations are computed for perturbed inputs, differences are measured, and maximum sensitivity scores are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior detected. The code performs legitimate sensitivity analysis calculations. No obfuscated language features or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a perturbation function (`default_perturb_func`) to generate noisy inputs within a specified radius, used in the `sensitivity_max` function to evaluate the maximum change in explanations under input perturbations. The code extensively uses utility functions for tensor formatting and argument expansion, which are standard in interpretability analysis. The core logic involves batching and perturbing inputs, computing explanations, and measuring the norm of differences, which aligns with accepted practices for sensitivity metrics. No code indicates data exfiltration, system access, or malicious payloads. The use of standard libraries (`torch`, `captum`) and utility functions suggests legitimate research or analysis purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a neural network explanation sensitivity metric. It does not contain malicious or sabotage behaviors. The purpose aligns with interpretability research, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
