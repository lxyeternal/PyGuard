  "purpose": "Import logging functions and classes from the captum.log.fb.internal_log module or fallback to captum.log.dummy_log if the former is unavailable, for internal logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from captum.log.fb.internal_log or captum.log.dummy_log modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially used logging functions and classes, which could be used to record or transmit data internally.",
  "flows": "Imported functions/classes could be used throughout the broader application to log or track usage, but no direct data flow is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import with fallback is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs present. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import several logging-related functions from a specific module. If the import fails (possibly due to the module not existing or being inaccessible), it falls back to importing dummy functions. This pattern is common for optional dependencies or ensuring compatibility. No data manipulation, network access, or other suspicious activity occurs in this snippet. It appears to be a standard, benign setup for logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import with a fallback, intended for logging purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this fragment.",
