  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the associated code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - The code attempts to import specific logging functions and classes from `captum.log.fb.internal_log`.\n   - If that import fails (e.g., module not found), it falls back to importing from `captum.log.dummy_log`.\n   - The purpose is to set up logging functions for internal use, with optional fallback.\n   - No data processing, network activity, or external input handling is present.\n   - The code pattern is standard for optional dependencies or environment-specific modules.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The fallback mechanism is a common pattern, not suspicious.\n   - No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious code are evident.\n   - No unusual control flow or obfuscated constructs.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Scores & Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n   - **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), justified because the code only handles imports, with no active data or network operations.\n   - **Confidence levels:** High (mostly 0.9 or 1), given the clarity and standard pattern.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent; they uniformly conclude the code is benign.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is accurate.\n   - The fallback to dummy implementations indicates the code is designed for robustness, not malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Justification & Final Estimation:**\n   - The code is a typical import pattern for optional dependencies.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to it.\n   - Malware and obfuscated scores should stay at 0.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the benign nature)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code snippet is benign, standard, and safe. The reports are accurate in their assessments, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
