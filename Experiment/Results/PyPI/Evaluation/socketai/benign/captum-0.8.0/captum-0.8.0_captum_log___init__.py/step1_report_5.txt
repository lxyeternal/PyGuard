{
  "purpose": "The code imports logging functions and classes from a specific module, handling import errors gracefully.",
  "sources": "Import statements from captum.log.fb.internal_log or captum.log.dummy_log based on availability.",
  "sinks": "Usage of imported functions/classes could potentially be used for logging or other operations, but no direct sink for untrusted data or malicious actions is evident.",
  "flows": "Import from fb.internal_log or dummy_log modules, depending on success, with fallback to dummy_log if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a fallback import to handle ImportError, which is standard; no unusual or suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import several logging-related functions and classes from a module. If the import from 'internal_log' fails (possibly due to missing or incompatible module), it gracefully falls back to import from 'dummy_log'. This pattern is a common approach for optional or environment-dependent imports. The code does not contain any direct data handling, input reading, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of try-except for fallback import is safe and intended for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import with error handling pattern for optional dependencies. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It functions solely to set up logging utilities, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
