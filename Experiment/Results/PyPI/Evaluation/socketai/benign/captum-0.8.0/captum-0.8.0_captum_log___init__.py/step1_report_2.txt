{
  "purpose": "The code imports logging functions and classes from the 'captum.log' package, handling import errors to fallback to a dummy implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'captum.log.fb.internal_log' and 'captum.log.dummy_log'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are directly assigned to variables, with no data flows from external sources or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for imports, fallback to dummy implementations, which is standard practice to handle missing modules; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import specific logging functions and classes from a package. If the import fails, it switches to dummy implementations. The code is solely concerned with setting up logging functions and does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. It is a typical pattern for optional dependency handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard import fallback pattern for logging modules, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
