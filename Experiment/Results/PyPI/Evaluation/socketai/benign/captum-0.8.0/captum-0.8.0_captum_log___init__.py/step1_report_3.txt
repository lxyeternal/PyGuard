{
  "purpose": "This code manages the import of logging functions from the 'captum.log' module, providing fallback imports in case of ImportError.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'captum.log' module and attempts to import specific functions and classes from it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present; this code does not process external input or data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only imports modules and functions without processing data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The structure is straightforward with conditional imports, typical for handling optional dependencies. No suspicious or unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import several logging-related functions from 'captum.log.fb.internal_log'. If that import fails, it falls back to importing the same functions from 'captum.log.dummy_log'. This pattern suggests conditional fallback handling, likely for different runtime environments. The use of try-except for ImportError is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. No data processing, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import fallback mechanism for logging functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be a benign setup for logging in a larger application.",
