  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard import with fallback, no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None identified. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — correct.  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — justified, no malicious behavior.  \n  - *Security Risk:* 0.1 — minimal, perhaps due to the fallback pattern, but overall very low risk.  \n  - *Overall:* The low security risk score seems reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification for scores:** The code is benign, so scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, consistent and accurate. No issues or malicious activity.  \n- Scores are justified, with malware and obfuscated at 0, and minimal security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same pattern, standard import with fallback.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same as above, standard fallback import pattern.  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Again, standard import with fallback, no malicious intent.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- Scores align with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code behavior:** All reports describe a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency handling via try-except import fallback.  \n- **Malware potential:** None detected; all scores reflect this.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None present; scores are zero.  \n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly due to the fallback pattern which is common and safe.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The malware scores across all reports are appropriately zero, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly zero.\n- The security risk scores are low, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or slightly above zero, but given the fallback pattern, I would keep it at 0.1 or 0.2 at most, reflecting minimal risk due to fallback handling, but not malicious).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a typical, safe import pattern with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
