  "purpose": "Import logging functions from 'captum.log.fb.internal_log' with a fallback to 'captum.log.dummy_log' if the primary import fails, ensuring compatibility across environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'captum.log.fb.internal_log' or 'captum.log.dummy_log'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; only module imports and fallback logic.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import from primary module; if fails, import from fallback module. No data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import with fallback pattern, no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import with a try-except fallback, a common pattern for optional dependencies. No data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The fallback to dummy implementations indicates a benign compatibility measure. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code is safe, and the fallback pattern is standard practice, not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import pattern with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
