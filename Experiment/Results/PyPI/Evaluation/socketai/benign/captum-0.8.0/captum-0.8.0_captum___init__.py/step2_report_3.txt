  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a simple Python script that imports specific submodules from the 'captum' library, sets a version string, and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n- There are no embedded functions, data processing, network operations, or external data inputs.\n- The code is straightforward, typical for a module setup or configuration script.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None. The code is syntactically correct and logically straightforward.\n- **Security flaws:** None.\n- **Misleading claims:** No claims are misleading; all reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly reflecting that the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are 0, which is correct.\n\n### Malware score justification:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The 'captum' library is an open-source interpretability toolkit for machine learning models, widely used in the community.\n- No signs of malicious intent are present.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Some reports mention that the code \"reads data indirectly\" or \"sets metadata,\" but these are benign actions in this context.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted; the code does not handle external inputs or perform risky operations.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is purely import statements, version setting, and export definitions.\n- It is typical boilerplate for a Python module or package initialization.\n- No malicious or security-risk behaviors are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is entirely benign. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
