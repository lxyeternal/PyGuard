{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the 'captum' library, likely to perform interpretability and influence analysis for machine learning models.",
  "sources": "The module imports are static and do not read external data or input at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations are present; the code only defines metadata and imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely import and metadata definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. All imports are from a legitimate library.",
  "analysis": "The script sets a strict type mode comment, defines metadata such as version, and exports modules via __all__. It imports only standard 'captum' submodules, which are used for model interpretability. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign Python module setup for a machine learning interpretability toolkit, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
