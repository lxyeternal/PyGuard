{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules from the captum library, likely to perform model interpretability, influence analysis, logging, metrics, and robustness assessments in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the captum library",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, untrusted input sources, or output targets are present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are evident as the code only imports modules and sets a version and export list",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package or script setup",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific submodules from the captum library, sets a version string, and defines an exported module list. There are no embedded functions, data processing, network operations, or file I/O that could indicate malicious activity. The import of captum modules is typical for machine learning interpretability tasks and does not in itself suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be a configuration or initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a setup or configuration for a machine learning interpretability tool using captum. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
