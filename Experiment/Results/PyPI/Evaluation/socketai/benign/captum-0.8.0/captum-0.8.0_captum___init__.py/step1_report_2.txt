{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the 'captum' library, which is used for model interpretability and attribution in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "The code reads data indirectly through the imported modules, which are likely used in subsequent code for model analysis.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writing, or system commands are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Since the code only imports modules and sets a version and export list, there are no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward and solely involves importing modules and setting metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple submodules from the 'captum' package, which is an open-source library for model interpretability in Python. It sets a version string and defines what is exported when the module is imported. There are no suspicious patterns, no embedded code execution, no network activity, and no hardcoded secrets. The code is minimal, structured, and typical for a library interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module interface for the 'captum' library without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
