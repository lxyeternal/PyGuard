{
  "purpose": "The script imports various modules from the 'captum' library, likely for model interpretability and analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules 'attr', 'concept', 'influence', 'log', 'metrics', 'robust' from the 'captum' package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external connections are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets a version and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. The code appears to be straightforward library imports with versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple setup script that imports specific modules from the 'captum' package, sets a version string, and defines the exported symbols. It does not process any input, handle external data, or perform actions that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for a module initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module import and export statements with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
