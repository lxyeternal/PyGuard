{
  "purpose": "Minimal setup script importing modules from the 'captum' interpretability library, defining version and export list.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'captum' modules, setting __version__, defining __all__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, network, or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "None; static import and metadata assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statements, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a reputable library, a version string, and an __all__ list. No dynamic execution, data processing, network activity, or embedded malicious code is present. The code is typical for a module's setup or initialization. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and use of a well-known library indicate no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
