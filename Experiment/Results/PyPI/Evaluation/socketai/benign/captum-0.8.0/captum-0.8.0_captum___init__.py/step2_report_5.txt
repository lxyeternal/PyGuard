  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently identify that the code only imports modules from the 'captum' library, sets a version string, and defines an export list.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code appears to be a benign setup or configuration script for a machine learning interpretability toolkit.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and confidence of 1.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \nYes. The reports correctly identify that the code only performs static imports and metadata definition, with no malicious activity.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \nNo. The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n**3. Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- Malware score: 0 in all reports. Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0. Also appropriate.\n- Confidence: 1, as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \nSince the code is purely import statements with no dynamic or malicious behavior, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \nThe code imports known, legitimate modules. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or embedded malware. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \nNo such claims are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**  \nAll scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0** (or very close to it)\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard setup script importing modules from a reputable library, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type     | My Estimated Value | Rationale                                                      |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                    | No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.    |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                    | Clear, straightforward import statements.                      |\n| Risk           | 0                    | No security risk detected; purely static imports and metadata.|\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code appears to be a standard, safe module setup for a machine learning interpretability library. No further action or concern is necessary.",
