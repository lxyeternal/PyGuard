  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a minimal Python script that imports specific submodules from the 'captum' library, sets a version string, and defines an export list (__all__). It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or other dynamic behaviors.\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for a module setup or configuration script.\n\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code does not contain any embedded malicious code, data flows, or suspicious behavior.\n   - It is purely import statements and metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is just importing modules and setting metadata, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score.\n   - The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n5. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; all reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk in import scripts, but generally very low)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, as it’s a benign setup script)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score.",
