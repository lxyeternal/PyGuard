  "purpose": "Shebang line indicating the script should be run with Python 3",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a shebang line with no data input or code execution",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external communication present",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow exists",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a minimal shebang line with no suspicious or unusual features",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) with no additional code, logic, or data handling. There are no sources, sinks, or flows, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The assessments in the reports are consistent, correctly identifying the benign and minimal nature of the snippet. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and justified given the content. No further analysis or suspicion is warranted based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign shebang line with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
