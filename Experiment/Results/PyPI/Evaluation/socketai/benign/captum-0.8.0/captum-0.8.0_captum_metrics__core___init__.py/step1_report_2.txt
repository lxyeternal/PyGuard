{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a shebang line indicating that the script should be run using Python 3.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling is present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or logic flow can be determined from a single shebang line.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang line with no additional logic, input handling, or code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is merely a shebang line, which specifies the interpreter for executing the script. It does not include any executable logic, data processing, or security-relevant operations. Since no other code is present, there are no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies to evaluate. The snippet provides no malicious behavior or security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal script with only a shebang line. It does not contain any code that could be malicious or pose security risks. It is a standard header for a Python script, and on its own, it is safe.",
