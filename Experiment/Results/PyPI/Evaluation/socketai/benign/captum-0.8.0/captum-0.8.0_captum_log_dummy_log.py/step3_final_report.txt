{
  "purpose": "This code defines skeleton functions and classes intended for logging, environment management, and method patching, but contains no active implementation.",
  "sources": "Function definitions and class constructors that could read configuration or input parameters, but currently do not process any data.",
  "sinks": "Potential environment variables or logging outputs if implemented, but presently none are active.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occur due to placeholder functions.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are unimplemented with 'pass' statements; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-functional scaffold for logging and environment setup, with all functions being placeholders. No data is read, processed, or transmitted. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence score reflects the clear benign nature of the code in its current state.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, incomplete skeleton intended for future implementation of logging and environment management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks at this time.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
