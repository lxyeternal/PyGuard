The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of external functions supplied by users. Given the absence of external network activity, file I/O, or malicious patterns, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 to account for potential misuse of user functions."

The main potential risk is from externally supplied functions, which is a common pattern and outside the scope of this review."

Obfuscation in Report 4 warrants a slightly higher malware suspicion, but overall, the code appears benign. The low security risk scores are justified, and the confidence levels are appropriate. Minor adjustment in malware score for Report 4 to 0.4 could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable."
