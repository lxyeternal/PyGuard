  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for infidelity-based attribution evaluation. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of external functions supplied by users. Given the absence of external network activity, file I/O, or malicious patterns, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 to account for potential misuse of user functions."
