{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions to compute the infidelity metric for evaluating attribution methods in explainability of neural networks, specifically using perturbation-based approaches to measure how well explanations align with model behavior under input perturbations.",
  "sources": "Inputs: `inputs`, `attributions`, `baselines`, `additional_forward_args`, `target`, `perturb_func`; Data read occurs when functions invoke model forward passes via `_run_forward` and when perturbation functions are called.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be leaked or maliciously manipulated during the execution of `perturb_func`, especially if it involves external data sources. No explicit network communication, file access, or data exfiltration code is present. Model outputs could be indirectly affected if malicious perturbation functions or models are used.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from `inputs` and `baselines` into perturbation functions and model forward calls (`_run_forward`). Perturbations generated are used to compute differences and attribution relevance scores, which are then aggregated into the infidelity metric. Model outputs (`forward_func`) are used as sinks for prediction evaluations. The flow of data is internal, with no external data sinks or communications visible.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls. The code uses standard testing and evaluation patterns with typical debugging/logging decorators (`log_usage`). No obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic code execution is present. The use of `torch.repeat_interleave` and tensor operations appears consistent with the intended metric computation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a detailed implementation of infidelity metric computation, involving input formatting, perturbation generation, and model evaluation. Functions are carefully structured to handle multiple input types and batching for performance. The use of standard PyTorch tensor operations, and the absence of network or file system operations, reduces suspicion. The core components involve perturbation generation, forward passes, and tensor operations, all within typical explainability evaluation logic. No malicious or sabotage code patterns are observed, such as data exfiltration, system access, or code injection. The code relies on legitimate libraries (`torch`, `captum`) and implements mathematically sound procedures for attribution evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of an input perturbation-based infidelity metric used for explainability assessment in neural networks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external interactions. It focuses on tensor computations and model evaluations. Overall security risk is minimal, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
