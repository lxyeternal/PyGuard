{
  "purpose": "The code implements a metric called 'infidelity' for evaluating attribution methods in machine learning models, specifically using perturbation-based approaches to measure explanation quality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input tensors (`inputs`, `attributions`, `baselines`), the `perturb_func`, and optionally `additional_forward_args`. It also reads `target` indices for model outputs.",
  "sinks": "The code computes and returns infidelity scores, which involve mathematical operations on tensors. It calls `forward_func` on perturbed inputs and computes differences. No network connections or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is read at the start (`inputs`, `attributions`, `baselines`). The `perturb_func` generates perturbed inputs (`_generate_perturbations`), which are then processed to compute model outputs (`_run_forward`). These outputs are compared against attributions, and the infidelity score is calculated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code focuses on numerical tensor operations, perturbation, and model evaluation.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured for computing an attribution metric, involving input formatting, perturbation generation, model forward passes, and tensor operations to aggregate errors. The functions utilize standard PyTorch and Captum utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior. It does not perform any network communication, file system manipulation, or privilege escalation. The only operations are mathematical computations on tensors, standard for attribution evaluation. No anomalies such as hidden data leaks or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an infidelity metric for attribution evaluation. It performs numerical operations, tensor manipulations, and model inference without any suspicious or malicious intent. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
