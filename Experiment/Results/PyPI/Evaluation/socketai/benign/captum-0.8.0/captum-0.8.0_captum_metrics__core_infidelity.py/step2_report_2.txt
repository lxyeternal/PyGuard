  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment based on the code and reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Explains the implementation of infidelity metrics, input formatting, perturbation generation, and model evaluation.\n- **Potential Risks:** Mentions untrusted data flow during `perturb_func` execution, but no external network, file access, or malicious code is evident.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** Uses standard libraries (`torch`, `captum`), no obfuscation, no suspicious external calls, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, mathematically sound, and safe implementation. Risk score: **0.1** (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** No malware, no obfuscation, very minimal security risk. The logic and data flow are typical for explainability metrics.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar explanation focusing on input formatting, perturbation, and model evaluation.\n- **Potential Risks:** No external network or file operations; calls to `forward_func` and `perturb_func` are standard and controlled.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** Uses standard tensor operations, no suspicious code patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, safe implementation for explanation evaluation. Risk score: **0.0**.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focused on attribution evaluation via perturbations, with no external side effects.\n- **Potential Risks:** Calls to user-supplied `forward_func` and `perturb_func` could be malicious if those functions are malicious, but the code itself does not perform malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate implementation. Risk score: **0.2** (slightly higher due to potential misuse of user-supplied functions).\n\n**Assessment:** The main concern is the trustworthiness of user-supplied functions, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar explanation, emphasizing that the code calls external functions which could be malicious if provided maliciously.\n- **Potential Risks:** Same as above; no direct malicious code.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard pattern. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above; the code is safe but relies on trusted external functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focused on explanation evaluation, with potential for data leakage if inputs are sensitive.\n- **Potential Risks:** Calls to `forward_func` and `perturb_func` are external points that could be malicious if untrusted.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports and the code show no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code is purely tensor computation and model evaluation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation patterns, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic.\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern is the use of user-supplied functions (`perturb_func`, `forward_func`) which could be malicious if provided from untrusted sources. However, the core code is safe, and these functions are external hooks, not embedded malicious code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malware signals.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on external functions, I would assign a **0.2** to reflect the potential for malicious behavior if those functions are compromised, but the code itself remains safe.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for evaluating attribution explanation methods via the infidelity metric.\n- No signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The primary security concern is external function trustworthiness, not the code itself.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0.0** | **0.0**      | **0.2** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.",
