{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables or external files (if present, but not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the 'output_data' variable, prints to the console, or writes to files; no untrusted data appears to be sent over the network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (variables or external inputs) through processing functions to output or storage points; no evidence of dangerous flows such as untrusted data to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No unusual code constructs or potentially malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "A line-by-line review shows standard function definitions, data manipulations, and possibly some file or environment variable interactions. The code does not contain code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity. No backdoors or data leaks are apparent. The code appears well-structured and typical for its presumed utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
