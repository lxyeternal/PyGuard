  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with their assessments, indicating no active malicious behavior. Obfuscation in Report 4 warrants a slightly higher malware suspicion, but overall, the code appears benign. The low security risk scores are justified, and the confidence levels are appropriate. Minor adjustment in malware score for Report 4 to 0.4 could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable."
