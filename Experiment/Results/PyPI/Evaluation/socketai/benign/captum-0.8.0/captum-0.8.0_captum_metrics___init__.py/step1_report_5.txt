{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from the captum.metrics library, likely to be used for model interpretability metrics such as infidelity and sensitivity.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported functions from the captum.metrics._core modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing functions and exposing them via __all__; there are no data flow paths involving external or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code strictly involves import statements and an explicit list of exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific functions related to model interpretability metrics from the captum library. It does not process any input data, execute dynamic code, or include any hidden behaviors. All imported functions appear to be standard, well-documented parts of the Captum library, which is used for explainability in machine learning. The __all__ list indicates these functions are intended for external use. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or insecure behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module that re-exports specific functions from the captum.metrics library for use elsewhere. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no security risks. It is a typical, safe import and export structure in Python.",
