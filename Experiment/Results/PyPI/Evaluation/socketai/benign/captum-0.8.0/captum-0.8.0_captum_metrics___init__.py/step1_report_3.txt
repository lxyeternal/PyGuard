{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports specific functions from the 'captum' library related to metrics such as infidelity and sensitivity, likely for use in model interpretability or explainability.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from 'captum.metrics._core.infidelity' and 'captum.metrics._core.sensitivity'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are assigned to the module's namespace for external use; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports specific functions from the 'captum' library and re-exports them via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or untrusted inputs. The imported functions are well-known metrics used in model interpretability and do not exhibit malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple re-export module for functions from the 'captum' library related to model explainability metrics. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
