{
  "purpose": "Export functions related to model interpretability metrics (infidelity and sensitivity) from the captum.metrics library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the captum.metrics._core modules, which are part of the open-source captum library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external network calls, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports functions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific functions related to model interpretability metrics from the captum library and re-exports them. There are no dynamic code execution, data processing, or network operations. The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain suspicious or malicious behavior. It is likely part of a larger project focused on model explanation metrics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports functions from the captum library without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. Overall security risk is very low.",
