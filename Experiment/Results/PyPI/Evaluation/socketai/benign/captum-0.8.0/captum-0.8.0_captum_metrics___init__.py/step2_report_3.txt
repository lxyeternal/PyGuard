  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the findings, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code imports functions from 'captum.metrics._core.infidelity' and 'captum.metrics._core.sensitivity', then exposes them via `__all__`.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external data flows, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0. Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. Importing and re-exporting functions without executing code or handling untrusted data is benign. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, re-exporting interpretability metrics functions from 'captum'.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, no network calls, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slight security risk score (0.1) seems to reflect the minimal exposure—just importing functions. Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present, this score might be slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—importing and re-exporting interpretability functions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious behavior. The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, straightforward import and export of functions.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no data flows, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous findings. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—importing and exposing interpretability functions.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward and not obfuscated; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Risk Score:** The minimal import/export pattern carries negligible security risk; scores of 0 or 0.1 are appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The code appears to be a benign, standard re-export module for interpretability metrics from the 'captum' library.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard import/export pattern)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, just structural import/export with no data handling)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the reports' assessments and scores.",
