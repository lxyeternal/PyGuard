  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- It imports specific functions (`infidelity`, `infidelity_perturb_func_decorator`, `sensitivity_max`) from internal modules of the `captum.metrics._core` package.\n- It exposes these functions via `__all__` for external use.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and only involves import/export statements.\n- No data processing, user input, network calls, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Re-exports functions from `captum`.\n- Sources: Internal modules.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Data flows only from library functions to exports.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard re-export module.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Export interpretability metrics functions.\n- Sources: From `captum.metrics._core`.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Simple import and re-export, no dynamic code or network activity.\n- Conclusion: Very low security risk.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Re-export functions related to model interpretability.\n- Sources: From `captum.metrics._core`.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, standard pattern.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Import interpretability metrics functions.\n- Sources: From `captum.metrics._core`.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Simple import/export, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, part of a larger interpretability framework.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Re-export interpretability metrics functions.\n- Sources: From `captum.metrics._core`.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No data flow involving untrusted sources.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard import/export, no dynamic code or malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, typical pattern.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected. The code is just a simple re-export module.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; no data leaks, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware score justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the above, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0**     |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence from both the code and the detailed reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign module that re-exports functions from the `captum` library. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is present. The reported scores are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
