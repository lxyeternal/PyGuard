  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, examining the logic, and assessing the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal: just import statements and an `__all__` list.\n- All reports agree that the code only imports functions from the 'captum' library and re-exports them.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The 'captum' library is a well-known open-source library for model interpretability.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n\n**Issue presence:**  \n- The code appears benign; no malicious code, no vulnerabilities, no suspicious behavior.  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code only imports and re-exports functions.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the nature of the code as a simple re-export module.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- All reports assign very low or zero risk scores, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n- None of the reports justify higher scores, and given the code's simplicity and transparency, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**Scores consistency:**  \n- The scores align well with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The reports mention the source as 'captum' library modules, which are open-source and well-known.\n- No supply chain attack or malicious intent is suggested.\n- The purpose is solely to re-export interpretability functions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** No malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** No obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **Should be 0 or very close to it.** The code is harmless.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious activity present                                |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, straightforward import/export code                     |\n| Risk            | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or security issues detected             |\n\n---\n\n### Final remarks:\n\nThis code is a benign, standard module that re-exports functions from the 'captum' library. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The code is safe and does not warrant any higher risk or malware scores.  \n- I agree with the current assessments, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is needed.",
