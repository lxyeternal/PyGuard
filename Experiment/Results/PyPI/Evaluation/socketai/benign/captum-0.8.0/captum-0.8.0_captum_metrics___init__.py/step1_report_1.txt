{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from the 'captum' library, which is used for model interpretability and explainability, and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'captum.metrics._core.infidelity' and 'captum.metrics._core.sensitivity', which are likely internal modules of the 'captum' library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external 'captum' library functions to the module's exported symbols; no untrusted input or external data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code consists solely of import statements and an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions from the 'captum' library and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There is no data processing, user input handling, or other potentially risky operations. The use of relative internal module imports is standard for well-structured Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that re-exports selected functions from the 'captum' library. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
