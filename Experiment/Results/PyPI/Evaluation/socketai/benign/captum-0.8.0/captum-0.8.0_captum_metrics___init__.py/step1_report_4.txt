{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific functions related to model interpretability metrics from the 'captum' library, likely for use in analyzing machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from 'captum.metrics._core.infidelity' and 'captum.metrics._core.sensitivity'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations; code primarily performs imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Imports serve as source points; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and limited to imports and module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions related to model interpretability metrics, which is typical for analysis workflows. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious behavior present. It simply re-exports functions for external use, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward module that exports selected functions from the 'captum' library. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase focused on model interpretability.",
