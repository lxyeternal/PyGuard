  "purpose": "Re-export specific interpretability metric functions from the 'captum' library for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'captum.metrics._core.infidelity' and 'captum.metrics._core.sensitivity'.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Importing functions from internal modules to module namespace for export.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports specific functions from internal 'captum' modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard re-export module for interpretability metrics from 'captum'. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
