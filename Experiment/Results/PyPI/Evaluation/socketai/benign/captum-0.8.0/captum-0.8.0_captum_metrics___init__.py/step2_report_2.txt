  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code only imports specific functions from the 'captum' library's internal modules and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n- There is no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward module intended to expose certain metrics functions for external use.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; imports from 'captum.metrics._core.infidelity' and 'sensitivity'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; it's a simple re-export module.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; imports specific interpretability metrics.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Proper; it's a minimal, safe re-export.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=1.\n\n**Note:** The security risk is minimal, justified by the lack of malicious activity. The low score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- Same as above; consistent observations.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- Similar findings; straightforward import/export.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- Same consistent analysis.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low, justified by the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n- **Confidence:** All are highly confident (1).\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, just re-export of safe functions)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard module that re-exports functions from the 'captum' library for interpretability metrics. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
