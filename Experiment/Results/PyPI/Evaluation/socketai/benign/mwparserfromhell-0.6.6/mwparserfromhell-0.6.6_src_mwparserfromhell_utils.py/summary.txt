  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for flexible parsing. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The security risk hinges on the external parser's security, which is outside this code's scope. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.15, reflecting reliance on an external component."
