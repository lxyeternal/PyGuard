  "purpose": "Utility functions for inheriting method docstrings from list and normalizing slices within a class.",
  "sources": "Method definitions (__doc__ attribute access), slice parameters (start, stop, step), class attributes (self, len(self)).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or outputs; internal attribute access and arithmetic only.",
  "flows": "Method __doc__ retrieves docstrings; _normalize_slice processes slice parameters to produce a normalized slice object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation of utility functions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator to copy docstrings from list methods and a mixin class that normalizes slice objects, handling negative indices and boundary conditions. It uses standard Python features and does not process external input or perform network/file I/O. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The logic is clear, well-documented, and typical for internal utility code. No signs of malicious behavior, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for internal use, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly assess the absence of malicious activity and assign scores accordingly. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
