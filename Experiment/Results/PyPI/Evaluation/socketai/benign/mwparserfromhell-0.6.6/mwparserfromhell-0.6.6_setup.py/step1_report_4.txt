  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package 'mwparserfromhell', used for parsing MediaWiki wikicode. It manages build options, dependencies, and extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables ('WITHOUT_EXTENSION'), command-line arguments ('--without-extension', '--with-extension'), reading 'README.rst' file, and importing __version__ from the package.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifying sys.argv, reading environment variables, importing version info, reading README file, printing error messages in exception handling.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line args influence build options; errors during extension build are caught and handled; reading version info from package; setting up package metadata and extensions based on build flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of try-except to handle build extension errors is standard. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation detected. The code contains standard setup logic with conditional extension building.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with optional C extension compilation. It handles environment variables and command-line args to determine whether to include C extensions. Error handling for extension build is present. The script reads package metadata and manages build options accordingly. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified. It adheres to typical packaging practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It manages build options and dependencies securely and transparently. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
