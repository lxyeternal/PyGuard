{
  "purpose": "Provides static data and utility functions for handling markup tags and URI schemes within a mediawiki parser context.",
  "sources": "Static data structures such as URI_SCHEMES, PARSER_BLACKLIST, INVISIBLE_TAGS, SINGLE_ONLY, SINGLE, and MARKUP_TO_HTML; functions operate on input parameters without external data or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not process untrusted input or data; they perform lookups and boolean checks only, with no data sinks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., markup symbols, tags, schemes) are used in lookup functions to return static mappings or boolean values; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; code is static, straightforward, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module defining constants and functions for handling markup tags and URI schemes. It performs simple lookups and boolean checks without processing external input, executing code, or performing network/file operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or vulnerabilities are present. The functions serve as helpers for sanitization and validation within a parser context. The data structures are hardcoded, and the logic is clear and safe. The malware scores are correctly zero, and the security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static utility module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
