  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as static, data-driven, utility functions for handling markup tags and URI schemes.\n- No external input is processed, no network or file operations are performed, and no dynamic code execution is present.\n- The data structures are hardcoded, and functions perform straightforward lookups or boolean checks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, reflecting the absence of exploitable issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is static, with no processing of untrusted input or external data. It’s a utility module with no apparent vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code is well-structured, and the functions serve their intended purpose safely.\n\n- **Scores given?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0 and security risks close to zero, which are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly 0; no malicious activity or code is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly 0; the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign very low or zero risk, which is justified.\n\n- **Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports challenge no claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the consistent evidence across all reports and the static, safe nature of the code, I concur with the existing scores. The code is a benign utility module with no security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because of the potential for misuse if integrated improperly, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, static, and utility-focused. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected, and the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and I agree with their assessments. The code does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
