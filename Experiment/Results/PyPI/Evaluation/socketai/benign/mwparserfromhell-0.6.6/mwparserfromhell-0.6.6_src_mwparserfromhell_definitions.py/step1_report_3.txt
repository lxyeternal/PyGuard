{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and data structures for handling markup, HTML tags, and URI schemes within a MediaWiki parser context.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, functions accessing these constants, and a utility function get_html_tag().",
  "sinks": "The get_html_tag() function retrieves HTML tags based on markup symbols; is_scheme() checks URI schemes; other functions evaluate tags for parsing, visibility, or single tags.",
  "flows": "Input markup symbols or schemes are passed to functions like get_html_tag() or is_scheme() to determine their properties or validity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed. The code mainly deals with static data and simple lookups.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static mappings and lists for handling markup tags and URI schemes, with straightforward lookup functions. No dynamic execution, external data input handling, or sensitive data processing occurs. The functions are simple and appear to be safe utility functions for a parser context. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard utility module for markup and URI handling in a parser. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and only static data and lookup functions. No security concerns are evident.",
