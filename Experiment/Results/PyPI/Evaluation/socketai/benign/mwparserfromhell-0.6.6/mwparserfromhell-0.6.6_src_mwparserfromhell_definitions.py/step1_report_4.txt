{
  "purpose": "This module provides utilities for handling markup data, such as determining HTML tags from wiki markup, checking URI schemes, and managing parser tags.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions that access URI_SCHEMES, PARSER_BLACKLIST, INVISIBLE_TAGS, SINGLE_ONLY, SINGLE, and MARKUP_TO_HTML; functions also read input parameters such as markup strings and tags.",
  "sinks": "Functions returning boolean values based on input parameters; no untrusted data is directly processed or used in potentially harmful operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (markup, tags, schemes) are processed by lookup dictionaries or simple condition checks; no flow from untrusted data to sensitive sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; the code uses static data structures and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily static, defining data structures and utility functions for markup processing. It does not perform any I/O, network operations, or execute untrusted data. All data access is via predefined dictionaries and lists. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. Functions are simple checks or mappings, which are unlikely to be exploited maliciously. No credentials, network connections, or file operations are included.\n\nThe code appears to be a harmless utility module intended for parsing and validation related to markup and URIs, with no malicious intent or dangerous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for markup and URI handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward data lookups and boolean checks without executing untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
