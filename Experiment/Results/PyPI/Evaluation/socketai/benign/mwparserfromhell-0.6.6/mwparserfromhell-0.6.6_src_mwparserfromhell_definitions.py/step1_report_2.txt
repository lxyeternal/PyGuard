{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and constants for parsing and handling markup, HTML tags, and URI schemes in a wiki/mediawiki context.",
  "sources": "Constants defining URI schemes, lists of blacklisted parser tags, and functions accessing these constants and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flow from untrusted input to dangerous functions or system calls.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious behavior; code primarily reads static data and performs straightforward lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static data definitions and simple functions for lookup and validation related to HTML tags and URI schemes. All data is hardcoded, with no external input or network activity. Functions such as get_html_tag, is_parsable, is_visible, is_single, is_single_only, and is_scheme perform static checks or mappings. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted. No signs of backdoors, code injection, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, non-malicious utility module for markup and URI scheme handling within a mediawiki context. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
