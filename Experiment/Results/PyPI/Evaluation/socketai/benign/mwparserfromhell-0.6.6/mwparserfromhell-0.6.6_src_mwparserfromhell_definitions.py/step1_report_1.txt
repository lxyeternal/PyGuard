{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions and constants for handling markup, HTML tags, and URI schemes related to mediawiki parsing and sanitization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the predefined dictionaries and lists such as URI_SCHEMES, PARSER_BLACKLIST, INVISIBLE_TAGS, SINGLE_ONLY, SINGLE, and input parameters to functions like get_html_tag and is_scheme.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input leading to security vulnerabilities such as data leakage, code execution, or system manipulation.",
  "flows": "The functions operate solely on provided arguments and internal static data; there are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward, static, and for utility purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code provides constants and functions for mapping markup to HTML tags, validating URI schemes, and categorizing tags for parsing. It only uses static data and simple logic. No external input processing, command execution, or sensitive data handling occurs. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The functions are safe and serve as utility helpers for sanitization and markup handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for handling markup and URI schemes in a mediawiki parser context. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
