  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is static, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The code only performs static lookups, validations, and mappings related to markup tags and URI schemes.\n- No external input is processed in a dangerous manner, no network or file operations, and no code execution based on untrusted data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n- The functions are simple and serve as utility helpers within a parser or sanitizer context.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The code is well-structured, with clear constants and straightforward functions.\n- The URI_SCHEMES dictionary explicitly marks certain schemes as True (trusted) and others as False (potentially unsafe or not recommended). The is_scheme() function correctly interprets the 'slashes' parameter.\n- The lists for parser blacklisting, invisibility, and single tags are static and based on known mediawiki extensions or HTML standards.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- Malware Score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated Score: All assign 0, consistent with the static, clear code.\n- Security Risk: Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which is reasonable considering the code's static nature and lack of external data processing.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- There are no actual vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors to challenge.\n- The only minor point is that the function `is_scheme()` could potentially be misused if someone interprets the False value in URI_SCHEMES as safe, but the code correctly distinguishes schemes based on their trustworthiness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign utility module for markup and URI validation.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes are necessary; the analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal inherent risk, but given the static nature, 0 is appropriate)\n\nThis code does not pose any supply chain security threat. It is a straightforward utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
