{
  "purpose": "Defines and manages data related to markup parsing and external URI schemes for a mediawiki-related application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from constant dictionaries and lists such as URI_SCHEMES, PARSER_BLACKLIST, INVISIBLE_TAGS, SINGLE_ONLY, SINGLE, and the input parameter 'markup' and 'scheme' in functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions return boolean values based on the input; no data is written to external systems, no network or file sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (markup, scheme) are checked against internal data structures to determine properties; no complex data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, focused on data lookup and simple logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains definitions of constants and functions that classify markup tags and URI schemes. It performs no external data processing or network communication. No indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions simply perform lookups and boolean checks on inputs, which are safe given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for parsing and validation within a mediawiki environment. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
