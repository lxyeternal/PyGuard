  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static, straightforward, and containing only predefined constants and simple lookup functions.\n- No external input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or backdoors are identified.\n- The functions are utility helpers for markup and URI validation, with no dangerous operations.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The `is_scheme()` function checks URI schemes against a whitelist/dictionary, with an optional `slashes` parameter. The logic appears correct and safe.\n- The constants and lists (`URI_SCHEMES`, `PARSER_BLACKLIST`, etc.) are static and well-defined.\n- The functions operate solely on provided arguments, with no external or untrusted data flows leading to system or data compromise.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1 in one case). Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or exploitable logic, this seems appropriate.\n\n**Potential Issues or Overestimations:**\n- No issues are apparent that would justify increasing the risk score above 0.1.\n- The code is purely utility-based, with no external input handling that could be exploited.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign utility module with no malicious or security risk behavior.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if a very conservative approach)  \n\nThis code does not pose any security threat or supply chain risk. It is safe, static, and straightforward.",
