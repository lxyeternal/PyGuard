  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a static utility module for handling markup tags, HTML tags, and URI schemes within a mediawiki context.\n- They emphasize that the code only uses static data, performs simple lookups, and contains no external input processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behaviors are identified.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and the security risk scores are very low or zero.\n- Confidence levels are high, indicating strong agreement among the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code does not process untrusted input, does not execute code dynamically, and does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are apparent in the code or the reports. The functions are straightforward, and data structures are static.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n  - Security risk scores are appropriately low given the static, read-only nature of the code.\n  - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign utility functions.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code does not contain any backdoors, malicious logic, or obfuscation.\n- It only performs static lookups and boolean checks.\n- The functions are safe and intended for sanitization and validation, not for executing or processing untrusted data.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0.0) — the last report assigns 0.1, but given the analysis, 0.0 seems more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is a benign utility module with no supply chain security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No modifications needed. The code is safe, static, and non-malicious.",
