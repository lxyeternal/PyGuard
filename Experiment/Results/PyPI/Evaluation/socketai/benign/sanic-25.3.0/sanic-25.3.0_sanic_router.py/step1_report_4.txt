{
  "purpose": "This code implements a custom router class for the Sanic web framework, handling route registration, retrieval, and validation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters (path, method, host, view_name, name, etc.), environment variables (not used directly), and route definitions via 'add' method.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'resolve' method, dynamic route normalization, and exception raising, which could lead to information leaks or improper request handling if exploited.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., path, method, host) through resolution and normalization functions, eventually resulting in route retrieval or error handling, with route definitions stored and accessed via internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. Use of 'lru_cache' for caching is standard; route normalization relies on function signatures, which is typical. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'Router' class extending 'BaseRouter', providing methods for adding routes, resolving requests, and normalizing paths based on handler signatures. Exception handling appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. Route addition involves normalization and validation, and route lookups utilize caching for efficiency. The code respects conventional patterns and does not exhibit suspicious or malicious constructs. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors are detected. The use of exception handling and route normalization is consistent with framework standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a router component within a web framework, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It operates within typical expectations and does not contain hidden or harmful behaviors.",
