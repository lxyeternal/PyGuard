  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Sanic router with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis."
