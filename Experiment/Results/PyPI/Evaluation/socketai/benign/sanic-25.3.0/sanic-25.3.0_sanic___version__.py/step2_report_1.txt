  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. The original code is:\n   ```python\n   __version__ = \"25.3.0\"\n   ```\n   This is a standard practice in Python packages and contains no input/output, data flow, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are identified.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or external data handling are present.\n   - The code is static and straightforward.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code only assigns a version string, the risk is negligible.\n   - Malware score is 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscation or hidden behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n   - The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n**Final Estimations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is a standard version string assignment with no security concerns. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No further action required.",
