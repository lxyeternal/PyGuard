  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - No input sources, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code snippet is benign and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments are unanimous in declaring no malicious behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, handling secrets, or network activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the simplicity of the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The reports are accurate, and the code is benign.",
