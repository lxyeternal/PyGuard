  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that this is benign, straightforward code.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The securityRisk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior justifies raising the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - Since the code only assigns a string to a variable, and there's no malicious activity, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and are based on observable code features.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final assessment:** The code is benign, and the reports are accurate.",
