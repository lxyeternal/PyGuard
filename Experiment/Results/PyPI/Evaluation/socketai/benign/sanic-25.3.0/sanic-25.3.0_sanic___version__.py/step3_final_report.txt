  "sinks": "None; no data input or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward version string assignment with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic are present. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any suspicious constructs or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as harmless, with high confidence, and assign appropriate scores reflecting its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version string assignment with no security concerns or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity and harmless nature.",
