{
  "purpose": "Defines HTTP response status codes, headers, and utility functions for HTTP handling, including module import and terminal detection.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as sys, functools, importlib, inspect, and optional third-party 'ujson'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; JSON dumping functions are used for serialization, but no network or file output directly shown.",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious intent; primarily utility functions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The import_string function dynamically imports modules/classes, which is typical but could be misused if supplied untrusted input (not shown here). No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides HTTP status code mappings, header sets, and utility functions. It handles module import dynamically with import_string, which could be exploited if external input is passed, but within this snippet, there are no such inputs. JSON serialization is handled with safe defaults. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of 'Default' class is benign, serving as a sentinel value. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility module for HTTP handling with no malicious intent. It contains safe practices and no signs of sabotage or malware. The dynamic import function could be a concern if misused externally, but within this context, it is benign.",
