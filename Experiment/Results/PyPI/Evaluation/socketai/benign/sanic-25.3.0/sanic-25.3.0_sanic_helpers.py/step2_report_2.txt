  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines HTTP status codes, headers, and utility functions. Uses `importlib` for dynamic imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The `import_string()` function dynamically imports modules/classes based on string input, which can execute arbitrary code if input is malicious.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that `import_string()` could be exploited if untrusted input is passed. No other malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report rightly flags the potential security concern but notes no malicious code present. Confidence is high (0.8). Malware score is 0, but the potential for code execution exists if misused.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, emphasizes safe patterns, environment detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same concern about `import_string()` with untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes the standard nature of the code, with the main risk being dynamic importation if used improperly.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk overall, with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on constants and utility functions, no external input processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or sinks involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation. The code is purely infrastructural.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very safe, confidence 1, malware 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous, standard HTTP utilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, malware 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern—defines constants and utility functions, including dynamic import.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, but the `import_string()` utility could be misused if external input is passed without validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe within this context, malware 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree that no malicious code or behavior is present. The only concern is the `import_string()` function, which can execute arbitrary code if given malicious input. Since no actual malicious input is detected or used here, the malware score remains at **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any reports. The code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The primary risk is the potential misuse of `import_string()` with untrusted input. Given that the code itself does not process external input directly, and no such input is shown, the risk remains low. The reports assign a risk score around 0.2-0.4, which seems reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard utility module for HTTP status codes, headers, and dynamic module importation.\n- The only security concern is the `import_string()` function, which can execute arbitrary code if misused with untrusted input.\n- Since the code snippet does not include any input validation or usage of `import_string()` with external data, the risk remains theoretical.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n\n| Aspect             | Score  | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                    |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Clear, straightforward code.                                                 |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2-0.3 | Potential if `import_string()` is misused externally; within this code, risk is minimal. |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code is safe but should be used with caution regarding the `import_string()` function if external input is involved.",
