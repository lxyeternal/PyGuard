  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code is a utility module for HTTP responses, with a notable concern about the `import_string()` function executing code based on dynamic string input, which could be exploited if user-controlled input is passed untrusted.\n\n- **Assessment:** The concern about `import_string()` is valid. Dynamic imports can be dangerous if external input isn't validated. The report correctly identifies this as a potential attack vector but notes no malicious code or obfuscation elsewhere.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious code detected) — reasonable.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.4 — slightly elevated, justified by the potential misuse of `import_string()` with untrusted input.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The only risk is external misuse of a utility function, which is standard but warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that `import_string()` could be risky if used with untrusted input, but no malicious code or obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that `import_string()` can be exploited if external strings are malicious. The code itself is standard, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — aligns with the potential risk if misused.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate and cautious. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code being mostly constants and utility functions, with no external data processing or network activity. The dynamic import is noted but considered safe within this context.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe, and the dynamic import is a common pattern. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — minimal, justified by the utility nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with negligible risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the standard nature of the code, with the only concern being the `import_string()` function if misused externally.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — consistent with potential external misuse.\n\n**Conclusion:** Well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent, and the dynamic import is safe unless misused externally.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — consistent with potential misuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code is purely infrastructural with no malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.4) are justified by the potential misuse of `import_string()` if external input is untrusted. Given that the code itself does not perform any unsafe operations, and the only concern is external usage, a conservative but reasonable score would be around **0.2**.\n\n- **Malicious Behavior & Obfuscation:** None detected.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2**\n\nThis reflects a standard, safe utility module with a known and manageable potential misuse in the dynamic import function.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The main concern is the potential for misuse of `import_string()` if external input is not validated, but within this code snippet, no such input is processed directly. The scores given in the reports are reasonable, and my assessment aligns with them, with a slight adjustment to the risk score to 0.2 for a balanced view.",
