  "purpose": "Provides HTTP status codes, header sets, and utility functions for module import and environment detection.",
  "sources": "The import_string function reads a module path string; no other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The import_string function can execute arbitrary code if given malicious input, acting as a sink for dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Input string to import_string() -> import_module() -> getattr() -> potential code execution if input is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on string input; no other anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module defining constants and functions. The import_string() function dynamically imports modules/classes based on string input, which can be exploited if external, untrusted input is passed. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The constants and header sets are static and safe. The potential security concern is the misuse of import_string() if used with unvalidated external input, but the code itself does not process such input directly. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic imports if misused, but within this code, it remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the import_string() function's potential misuse if external input is passed without validation. No actual malicious activity is present. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk ~0.2. Caution should be exercised if the import_string() function is used with untrusted data in broader application contexts.",
