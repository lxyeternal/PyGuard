{
  "purpose": "Defines basic HTTP standards, status codes, header sets, and utility functions for HTTP handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (`sys`, `functools`, `importlib`, `inspect`, optional `ujson`, `json`), and internal data structures (status codes, headers).",
  "sinks": "Uses `import_module` and `getattr` to dynamically load modules/classes. No direct data sinks handling untrusted data. No network or file output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Dynamic import in `import_string` function; no user input or external data directly processed within the code. No evident source-to-sink data flow; all data is predefined or imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. The dynamic import function could be misused if user-controlled string is passed externally, but within this code, it is a utility function, not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines HTTP status codes and headers, providing utility functions to check header types and message body presence. The dynamic import function is a standard utility that allows importing modules or classes by name, which could be exploited if user input is passed unsanitized outside this code, but there is no such invocation here. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The conditional import of `ujson` or `json` is benign. Overall, the code appears purely infrastructural and does not contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides standard HTTP utilities with no malicious intent. The only potential concern is the `import_string` function if misused externally, but within this code, it is a standard utility. No malware or security risks are detected.",
