{
  "purpose": "Provides HTTP status codes, header classifications, utility functions for module importation, and environment checks for use in an HTTP server or related application.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, functools.partial, importlib.import_module, inspect.ismodule, ujson.dumps or json.dumps, and constants defining HTTP headers and status codes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks involving untrusted data processing or transmission; no network or file operations are performed within this code.",
  "flows": "This code does not perform data flows from sources to sinks; it mainly defines constants and utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of standard libraries and well-known patterns indicates normal functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a collection of constants and utility functions for HTTP response management, module importing, and environment detection. No external input is processed directly, and no network, file, or environment modifications occur here. The import of 'ujson' with a fallback to 'json' is standard for performance optimization. The functions for checking headers and status codes follow RFC standards and do not contain malicious logic. The 'import_string' function dynamically imports modules or classes but does so using safe methods without executing untrusted input directly. The environment check 'is_atty()' is safe. The 'Default' class serves as a sentinel value and is implemented securely.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for HTTP handling and environment detection, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe for use within larger applications, assuming no external code is injected through dynamic import paths.",
