{
  "purpose": "Defines basic HTTP standards, status codes, header sets, and utility functions for HTTP handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads input from sys.stdout in is_atty(). Imports modules and classes dynamically via import_string(). Uses external JSON libraries (ujson or json).",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules/classes which could potentially load malicious code. sys.stdout and isatty() for environment detection (not malicious).",
  "flows": "import_string() loads modules/classes based on string input; potentially unsafe if string input is untrusted. is_atty() reads sys.stdout properties; safe.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import_string() which could be exploited if input strings are malicious; however, code properly splits module and class. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines constants, utility functions, and import mechanisms. The import_string() function dynamically imports modules/classes based on string input, which could be a vector for malicious module loading if input is untrusted. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. No obfuscated code or code that performs harmful actions is identified. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. The JSON dumping functions and status code definitions are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard HTTP utility module with safe patterns. The only potential concern is the import_string() function, which could be risky if used with untrusted input; however, this is a common pattern in dynamic import utilities. No malware or malicious behavior is evident. Overall, the code is safe with low confidence of malicious intent, but caution is advised if untrusted strings are passed to import_string().",
