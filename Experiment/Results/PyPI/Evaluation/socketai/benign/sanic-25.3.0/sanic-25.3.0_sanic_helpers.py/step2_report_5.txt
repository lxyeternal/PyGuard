  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the dynamic `import_string()` function as a potential security concern because it executes code based on string input, which could be malicious if user-controlled.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that `import_string()` could be exploited if untrusted input is passed. The rest of the code is standard, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0; the concern is about misuse, not actual malicious code present. Security risk is 0.4, which seems slightly high given that no actual exploitation is demonstrated or possible within this code alone.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score could be lowered to around 0.2, emphasizing that the function is safe if used properly, but caution is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that `import_string()` could be risky if used with untrusted input but notes no actual malicious code.\n\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, and the only concern is the dynamic import pattern, which is common but potentially dangerous if misused externally.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate. Security risk at 0.2 is reasonable, given the potential for misuse.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the safe nature of the code, noting no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correctly observes that the code is mostly constants and utility functions, with dynamic import being standard but potentially risky if misused externally.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. Security risk is 0.1, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, finds no malicious activity, just standard utility code.\n\n- **Analysis:** Accurate. The dynamic import function is a potential vector if misused, but within this code, no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, security risk 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizes safe practices and no malicious intent.\n\n- **Analysis:** Correct. The code is infrastructural, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code present. The `import_string()` function, while potentially dangerous if misused externally, is a common pattern and does not contain malicious payloads within this code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1–0.4). Given the potential misuse of dynamic importation, a conservative but reasonable score would be around 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — the only concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if external input is passed without validation, but no such usage is shown here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard utility module with no malicious content. The main security consideration is the `import_string()` function's potential misuse if external, untrusted input is passed to it. However, within this code snippet, it appears safe and typical for dynamic imports.\n\n**Final note:** Maintain caution if this utility is used in contexts where `import_string()` is called with untrusted data. Proper validation or whitelisting should be enforced externally.",
