  "purpose": "Provides basic definitions and utility functions for handling HTTP responses, headers, and module importation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, configuration of status codes, header sets, and the import_string function.",
  "sinks": "The import_string function could potentially execute untrusted code if provided with malicious module/class names.",
  "flows": "Input (module_name string) -> import_string (imports and possibly instantiates modules/classes) -> potential execution of arbitrary code if the input is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The import_string function executes code based on dynamic string input, which could be exploited if user-controlled input is passed without validation. No other suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines HTTP status codes, headers, and utility functions for HTTP response handling. The import_string function dynamically imports modules or classes based on a string, which can lead to code execution if the input is malicious and user-controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident in the rest of the code. The use of importlib for dynamic importation is standard but can be risky if not properly validated externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for HTTP response management with a potential security concern in the import_string function if misused. The dynamic import function could lead to code execution if untrusted input is provided, representing a possible attack vector. No other malicious behavior or obfuscation is present.",
