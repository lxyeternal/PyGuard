  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the `import_string` function as a potential security concern because it dynamically imports modules/classes based on user-controlled input, which could lead to code execution if exploited.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The core concern is valid: dynamic import functions can be exploited if external, untrusted input is passed.  \n  - The report correctly notes that no other malicious code or obfuscation is present.  \n  - The confidence score (0.8) seems reasonable given the inherent risk of such dynamic imports.  \n  - Malware score (0) is appropriate since no malicious behavior is observed directly.  \n  - Security risk (0.4) is moderate, reflecting the potential danger if misused.\n\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is sound. The concern about `import_string` is valid, but no actual exploitation is evident in the code itself. The score aligns with the potential risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that `import_string` could be risky if used with untrusted input but no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The report correctly states that the code is standard, with the main concern being dynamic import security implications.  \n  - Confidence is high (0.9), and malware score is 0, which is appropriate.  \n  - Security risk is low (0.2), consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Verdict:** Well-reasoned. The potential risk is acknowledged, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's constants, header sets, and utility functions, noting no suspicious activity or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The code is purely infrastructural; no external input is processed directly.  \n  - The `import_string` function is noted as potentially risky if misused but is standard.  \n  - Malware score (0) and security risk (0.1) are appropriate.  \n  - Confidence is high (1), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and comprehensive. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, and that `import_string` could be misused externally.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity is detected.  \n  - The security risk score (0.2) and malware score (0) are appropriate.  \n  - Confidence (0.9) aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, with the only concern being the dynamic import function if misused externally.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The code is safe in the context provided.  \n  - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  - The only potential security concern is the `import_string` function, which can be exploited if external input is passed without validation.  \n  - No actual malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  - Malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is observed.  \n  - Security risk scores are low, reflecting the potential risk if the function is misused externally, which is a standard caveat for dynamic import utilities.\n\n- **Recommendations:**  \n  - If this code is used in an environment where `import_string` could receive untrusted input, consider adding validation or restrictions to mitigate potential code execution risks.  \n  - No obfuscation or malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.2** (low, but potential concern if misused)\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the analysis above.",
