  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are present, evaluate the reasoning, and verify the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for Sanic, no active data flow, no untrusted sources, no anomalies, no malicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard exception hierarchy, purely class definitions with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward exception class hierarchy with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The reasoning is sound, and the score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines custom exceptions, with potential data flow from user input via constructor parameters (messages, headers). No malicious code detected.\n- **Findings:** Exception messages and headers could be influenced by user input, but this is standard in web frameworks; no backdoors or malicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes potential data flow from user input but finds no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is appropriate, considering no malicious behavior is present. The security risk is minimal, reflecting potential header injection if upstream validation is absent, but this is outside this code's scope.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with focus on exception classes, message and header handling based on inputs, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Exception constructors accept parameters that could be influenced by untrusted sources, but no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code is standard exception handling code, with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with potential for user-controlled data in headers/messages, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Potential for header injection if data is not sanitized upstream; no code injection or sabotage.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher due to potential header injection risk)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a reasonable concern—headers like 'WWW-Authenticate' and 'Content-Range' are constructed with user-influenced data. While no malicious code exists, the potential for header injection exists if upstream validation is not enforced. The malware score remains 0, which is correct, as no malicious code is present. The security risk is slightly elevated but still low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes, with optional parameters influencing response headers/messages, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious activity. The logic is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The code is a typical exception hierarchy, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent. The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no active or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with a slight increase (0.2) in one report due to potential header injection if inputs are not sanitized upstream. This is a valid concern but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The reports are accurate in their analysis.\n- The scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior exists in this code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, related to potential header injection if upstream validation is absent)\n\nThe code is a standard exception hierarchy for a web framework, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for a web framework's error handling. The current scores are appropriate; I would keep malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at around 0.1.",
