{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of exception classes for the Sanic web framework, used for error handling and HTTP response generation.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters such as message, headers, context, extra, and specific arguments like path, method, or content_range, which may originate from user input or upstream data.",
  "sinks": "Headers like 'WWW-Authenticate', 'Content-Range', and message content that are included in HTTP responses, potentially influenced by external data.",
  "flows": "User-controlled data flows into exception parameters, which are then used to construct response headers or messages, possibly leading to header injection if upstream validation is absent.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or active data flow from untrusted sources within the class definitions. The only potential anomaly is the inclusion of user-influenced data in headers/messages, which could be exploited if not validated externally.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various HTTP and internal exceptions, with constructors accepting parameters that may be influenced by external input. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious payload. The potential security concern is the use of user-controlled data in response headers and messages, which could lead to header injection if upstream validation is not enforced. The malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward, readable structure. The risk score is minimal (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting typical concerns about header injection in web frameworks, but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception hierarchy for the Sanic framework, with no malicious or sabotage activity detected. The only minor concern relates to the handling of user-influenced data in headers/messages, which is a common consideration in web application development. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and functions as intended for error handling.",
