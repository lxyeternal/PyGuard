  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining a hierarchy of exception classes for the Sanic web framework.\n- The code is composed of class definitions, constructors, and header/message handling.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and aligned with typical web framework error handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code solely defines exception classes with no active data flow or network operations.\n\n- **Are there any anomalies or suspicious patterns?**  \n  No. The code follows standard patterns, with optional parameters for messages, headers, context, etc.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The only concern could be if user-controlled data is passed into exception constructors, especially headers or messages, which could lead to header injection or information leakage if not sanitized upstream. However, this is a standard concern in web frameworks and outside the scope of these class definitions.\n\n- **Use of external data or untrusted sources?**  \n  The code references `STATUS_CODES` from `sanic.helpers`, which is a static mapping, and all data passed into constructors are parameters, not direct untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports indicate a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable class definitions.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the nature of this code (error handling classes), the risk score should be very low, close to 0. The reports assign values between 0.1 and 0.2, which is reasonable considering potential header injection if upstream data isn't sanitized, but that is outside this code's scope.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and standard exception hierarchy.\n- The only potential concern is the handling of user-supplied data in exception parameters, which could influence HTTP responses if not validated elsewhere. However, this is typical for web frameworks and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- No evidence of supply chain sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  I agree with the assigned scores:  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1–0.2 (considering potential header injection if upstream data is malicious, but this is outside the scope of these classes).\n\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?**  \n  Not justified here; the risk is minimal and primarily theoretical if upstream data is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to potential header injection if inputs are malicious, but this is outside the scope of these class definitions)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard exception hierarchy for the Sanic framework, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as intended for error handling, with potential vulnerabilities depending on upstream input validation, which is normal in web frameworks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure upstream validation of user input, especially when incorporating user-controlled data into headers or messages, but this concern is outside the scope of these class definitions.",
