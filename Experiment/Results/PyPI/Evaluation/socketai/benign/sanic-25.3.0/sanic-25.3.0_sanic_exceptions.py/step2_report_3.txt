  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential malicious signals, code behavior, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines HTTP and internal exceptions; no data flow from untrusted sources; static or controlled messages.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely class definitions for exceptions with no dynamic or network activity. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes; exception messages and headers could be influenced by user input; potential for headers/messages to be manipulated.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low)\n- **Analysis:** While exception messages and headers can be influenced by external data, this is standard in web frameworks. No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity. The mention of potential header manipulation is valid but not malicious in this context.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score is slightly above zero, reflecting minimal concern over untrusted data influencing headers/messages, which is typical in exception handling. The malware score remains 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with focus on exception classes; potential influence of input parameters on responses.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, or sabotage. Exception classes are standard. Potential header/message manipulation is a normal concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with parameters that could originate from untrusted sources; potential for header injection if upstream validation is lacking.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (slightly higher)\n- **Analysis:** The mention of user-supplied data in headers/messages is valid. While this could be a vector for header injection if upstream data isn't sanitized, within this code, there's no evidence of malicious intent or backdoors. The risk score reflects a potential security concern if validation isn't enforced elsewhere.\n- **Conclusion:** The score seems reasonable. No malware present, but awareness of potential header injection is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with parameters influencing headers/messages; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard exception handling with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with some minor concerns (0.1 or 0.2) about potential header injection if external data isn't sanitized upstream, which is standard in web frameworks.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- No evidence of malware or sabotage.\n- The only consideration is that exception messages and headers could be influenced by untrusted input, but this is a common pattern and outside the scope of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the potential for header injection if upstream validation is absent)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard exception hierarchy for the Sanic framework with no malicious behavior detected. The small risk score accounts for potential header injection vulnerabilities if input isn't validated elsewhere, but within this code, there's no malicious activity.",
