{
  "purpose": "Define various exception classes for HTTP errors, request handling, and internal server errors in the Sanic web framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data comes from within the code (class definitions, constructor parameters, class attributes).",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and attribute assignments that could be triggered by untrusted input, such as error messages and headers.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., messages, headers, content ranges) can flow into exception messages and headers, potentially influencing HTTP responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of format strings in headers (e.g., 'Content-Range', 'Allow', 'WWW-Authenticate') that incorporate external data; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes inheriting from base exception classes. Constructors accept optional parameters, including messages and headers, some of which may originate from untrusted sources in real use. The code handles messages and headers safely, decoding bytes to strings without executing or evaluating external data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or file manipulations are present. The use of exception messages and headers with user-supplied data could potentially lead to HTTP header injection if the data is not sanitized upstream, but this is outside the scope of this module and relies on external validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a web framework. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indicators are present. The only potential security concern relates to the handling of user-supplied data in headers and messages, which should be validated elsewhere, not within these class definitions.",
