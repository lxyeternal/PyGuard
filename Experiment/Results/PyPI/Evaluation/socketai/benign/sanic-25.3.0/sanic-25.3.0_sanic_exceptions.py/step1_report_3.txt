{
  "purpose": "This code defines various custom exception classes for error handling within the Sanic web framework, including HTTP errors, server errors, and specific failure scenarios such as file issues and websocket disconnections.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include the input parameters to exception constructors such as messages, headers, context, extra data, and other request-specific information.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling logic and header setting, including potentially setting WWW-Authenticate headers, message content, and status codes, which could influence HTTP responses or leak error details.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., message, headers, context) flow into exception objects which may influence HTTP responses; headers are set or augmented, and messages are constructed based on inputs and class defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code mainly involves exception class definitions, standard pattern for web errors, and dynamic header/message assembly. No obfuscated or misleading language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive set of custom exceptions for a web framework, primarily for handling HTTP error states and server conditions. Exception classes use standard Python idioms, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious payloads. The headers, messages, and status codes are set based on input parameters or class defaults, with no evident attempts to perform malicious actions or data exfiltration. The presence of challenge handling in Unauthorized exceptions is standard for authentication flows. Overall, this appears to be standard framework code for error handling with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for handling various HTTP and server errors within Sanic, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It is standard framework code focused on error representation and response formation.",
