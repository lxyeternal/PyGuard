  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely class definitions for exception handling, with no data flow from untrusted sources, no dynamic code, no network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard exception hierarchy.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the potential for exception messages and headers to be influenced by user input. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard error handling)\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate exception classes, potential for header/message injection if upstream validation fails, but no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard exception classes with parameters that could be influenced by external input, but no malicious patterns or behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Purely framework error classes, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, with notes on potential header injection if untrusted data isn't sanitized upstream. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (still low, standard exception handling with potential header injection risk if not validated externally)\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous, standard exception classes, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard error handling code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malware presence (score 0). The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors, a risk score of 0.0–0.1 is appropriate. The only minor concern is potential header injection if user-controlled data is passed into exception parameters, but this is a standard consideration and outside the scope of these class definitions.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a standard part of the Sanic framework's exception hierarchy.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack, malicious payload, or obfuscation.\n- The potential for header injection exists but is a common risk with any web framework handling user input, and not specific to this code.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to potential header injection if upstream validation is absent, but this is a standard concern, not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose a security threat based on the provided analysis.",
