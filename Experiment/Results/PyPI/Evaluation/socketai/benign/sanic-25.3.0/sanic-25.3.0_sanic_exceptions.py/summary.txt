  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception hierarchy for the Sanic framework, with no malicious or sabotage activity detected. The only minor concern relates to the handling of user-influenced data in headers/messages, which is a common consideration in web application development. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and functions as intended for error handling."
