{
  "purpose": "Define various HTTP and internal exceptions used by the Sanic web framework to handle errors and exceptional situations.",
  "sources": "None (mostly class definitions and constant references). Data is not read from untrusted sources within this code.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() calls with message parameters, headers modifications, and class attribute accesses. No direct untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable — the code consists of class definitions and exception handling logic without active data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic detected. The code appears to be a standard exception hierarchy with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exceptions inheriting from SanicException, mainly for HTTP error statuses, internal server errors, and specific error conditions. There are no data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. All headers and messages are either predefined or set via constructor parameters, with no untrusted data manipulation beyond standard exception messaging. The code structure aligns with typical web framework exception handling, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes for error handling within the Sanic framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as a typical error hierarchy with no malicious signals.",
