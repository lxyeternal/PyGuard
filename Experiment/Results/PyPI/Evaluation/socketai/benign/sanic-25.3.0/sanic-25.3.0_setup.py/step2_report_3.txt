  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script; reads version info, README, manages dependencies, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no suspicious behavior. The dependency management via environment variables is common and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard package setup, version extraction via regex, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. No signs of malicious activity, and the regex for version extraction is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup with environment variables controlling dependencies, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. Use of environment variables to conditionally include dependencies is typical and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar setup script, with environment variables controlling dependencies; no malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), but still high.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Assessment:** The slight increase in perceived risk is due to the environment variable manipulation, but this is standard practice. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, environment variables influence dependencies, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (still very low)\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to others; environment variables are common and safe here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious code, no obfuscation, and no external untrusted data handling.\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify a malware score of 0. This code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily because it only reads local files and environment variables for configuration, which is standard.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The existing scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of environment variables for optional dependencies is common and safe. The regex for version extraction is simple and secure.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The setup script is legitimate, safe, and free from malware or obfuscation. The current scores and assessments are accurate.",
