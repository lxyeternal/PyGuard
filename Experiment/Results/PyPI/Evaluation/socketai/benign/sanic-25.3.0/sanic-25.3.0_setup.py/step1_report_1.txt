{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'sanic' Python package, used to manage package installation, dependencies, and testing.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, version info from '__version__.py', reading README file, environment variables for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted input; setup files primarily read static files and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables control optional dependency removal; reading version info from a local file; executing setup with predefined parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables used to modify dependency installation are typical; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading static files and version info, defining dependencies, and configuring setup parameters. Use of environment variables to conditionally include dependencies is normal and safe. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The package appears to be a legitimate project setup script with no indication of malicious intent or malware. It does not contain obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious components. It securely manages dependencies and configuration without executing untrusted input or hiding malicious behavior.",
