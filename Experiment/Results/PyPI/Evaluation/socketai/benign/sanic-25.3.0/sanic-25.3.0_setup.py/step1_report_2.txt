{
  "purpose": "The script is used for packaging and distributing the 'sanic' Python web framework, including dependency management, version extraction, and setup configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a local file, reads README for long description, environment variables for dependency inclusion, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directs untrusted data to external systems, network, or system modifications; environment variables influence dependencies but are handled safely.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence conditional dependency inclusion; version string is extracted via regex from a local file; setup parameters are assembled and passed to setuptools.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious code paths or obfuscated code are present. Use of environment variables for dependency management is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines: reading version info via regex, reading long description, defining dependencies, conditionally removing dependencies based on environment variables, and calling setup(). The regex used for version extraction is straightforward and safe. Environment variables are used only to conditionally include dependencies, which is typical. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not execute untrusted input or contain obfuscated patterns. Overall, it appears to be legitimate package setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup script for the 'sanic' package. It performs dependency management, version extraction, and setup configuration without any malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
