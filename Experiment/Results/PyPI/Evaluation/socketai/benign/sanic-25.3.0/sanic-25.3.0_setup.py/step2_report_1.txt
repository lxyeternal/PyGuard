  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** Reads version info via regex, reads README, manages dependencies with environment variables.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup routine, no malicious code.\n- **Findings:** Same as above; regex for version extraction is straightforward, environment variables used for dependency control.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script with dependency management.\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; safe reading of version info, environment variables for optional dependencies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard setup process.\n- **Findings:** Reads version info, uses environment variables to control dependencies, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly elevated risk score.\n- **Justification for risk=0.1:** The only potential concern is the use of environment variables to modify dependencies, which could, in theory, be exploited if environment variables are manipulated maliciously. However, this is a common and controlled pattern in setup scripts.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious code or obfuscation. The risk score is slightly elevated but justified due to dependency control via environment variables.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Similar to others; environment variables influence dependencies, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly higher risk.\n- **Justification for risk=0.2:** Slightly increased due to environment variable influence, but still within normal bounds for setup scripts.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; no malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified due to environment variable influence on dependencies, which is standard practice but could be exploited if misused. However, in the context of a setup script, this is acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The environment variable-based dependency control is standard and safe here.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by dependency control via environment variables, which is common and generally safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The setup script is a typical, safe package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
