{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'sanic' Python package, responsible for package configuration, version extraction, dependency management, and environment setup.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local file using regex, reads README file, and checks environment variables for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; environment variables influence dependency inclusion but are handled safely; no network or external data output.",
  "flows": "Environment variables control the inclusion/exclusion of dependencies; version info flows from local files into setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward dependency management and version extraction; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading local files for version and description, managing dependencies with environment variables, and configuring setuptools. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external untrusted input handling is present. Environment variables are used in a typical manner to control optional dependencies, which is safe. Regex for version extraction is simple and secure. The code structure is clear and conventional, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup configuration script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
