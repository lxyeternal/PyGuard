{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up and configuring the 'sanic' Python package, including dependency management, version extraction, and test setup.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (SANIC_NO_UJSON, SANIC_NO_UVLOOP), local files (__version__.py, README.rst), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies list, environment variable checks, package data inclusion, setup configuration, and package installation commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence whether certain dependencies are included. Files are read for version info and description, then used to configure package installation. No external data flows to untrusted sources or network in this script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The environment variable checks for removing dependencies are standard. The use of regex to parse version info is safe; the code handles exceptions properly. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs setup configuration for a Python package with dependency management, version extraction from a local file, and environment-based conditional dependency inclusion. All operations are typical for a setup script. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. External inputs are limited to environment variables and local files. The code includes a custom test command class, standard in package setup scripts. No suspicious code patterns, malicious network activity, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages dependencies, reads version info, and configures package metadata without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
