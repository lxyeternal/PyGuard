{
  "purpose": "The script is used for packaging and distributing the Sanic web framework, including setting dependencies, version extraction, and configuration for setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a local __version__.py file, reads README content for long description, environment variables for conditional dependency exclusion, and user input via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Executes setup() from setuptools with specified parameters, reads files, and evaluates environment variables.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> Reads README -> Configures dependencies based on environment variables -> Calls setup() with parameters",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables to conditionally remove dependencies, which is normal. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious code behaviors, obfuscation, or external network actions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package. It reads version info securely, manages dependencies with environment variable controls, and prepares package metadata. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The only dynamic aspect involves environment variables controlling optional dependencies, which is typical for build scripts. No suspicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages dependencies, versioning, and package metadata securely. No malware or security risks are identified.",
