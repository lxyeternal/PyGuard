{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily importing and exposing components from the Sanic web framework for use in other modules or applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'sanic' package modules such as __version__, app, blueprints, config, constants, exceptions, request, response, and websockets.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data, code, or external commands are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines type aliases and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific modules and objects from the Sanic framework and defines type aliases for better type hinting. It then constructs an __all__ list for module exports. There are no input sources such as network, file, environment, or user input. There are no sinks or data manipulations, nor is there any dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, standard for setting up a module's public API, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for exposing Sanic framework components with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or security risks.",
