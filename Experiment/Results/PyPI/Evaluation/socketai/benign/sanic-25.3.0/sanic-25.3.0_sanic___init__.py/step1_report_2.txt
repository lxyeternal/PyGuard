{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import and export module for Sanic web framework components, defining type aliases and re-exporting objects and exceptions for easier access.",
  "sources": "Imports from Sanic modules (e.g., __version__, app, blueprints, config, constants, exceptions, request, response, websockets). No external or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations are identified. The code only imports and defines type aliases and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code does not handle input data or perform operations that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard import statements, type alias definitions, and an __all__ export list. No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports components from the Sanic framework and re-exports them for simplified access. It primarily consists of import statements, type alias definitions, and an export list. There are no dynamic evaluations, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious. The use of standard library and framework imports indicates typical usage without suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import/export module for the Sanic framework with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
