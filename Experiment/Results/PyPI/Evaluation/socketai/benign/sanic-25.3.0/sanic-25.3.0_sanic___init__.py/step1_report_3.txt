{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules, classes, and functions from the Sanic web framework and defines type aliases and exports commonly used components for a Sanic application.",
  "sources": "Imports from sanic modules, including version, app, blueprints, config, constants, exceptions, request, response, and websockets implementation.",
  "sinks": "The code exports symbols via __all__, which could potentially be imported elsewhere; no direct sink of untrusted data or external input is present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and type aliases without processing data or user input. No data flow from source to sink is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable use is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports components from the Sanic framework and defines type aliases. It then sets up an __all__ list for module exports. No data processing, user input handling, or external data reads are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for a Sanic application, intended to organize imports and exports. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup module that organizes imports and type aliases for Sanic. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for use as part of a larger Sanic project.",
