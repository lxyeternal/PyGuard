{
  "purpose": "This code primarily imports various components and types from the Sanic web framework for setting up and using a web application.",
  "sources": "Imports from sanic module and its submodules, such as __version__, app, blueprints, config, constants, exceptions, request, response, and websocket implementations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no untrusted data handling, no network operations, no file writes, or environment variable access present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and defines type aliases and an __all__ list. There are no data flows, input/output handling, or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard set of imports and definitions for a Sanic application. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, type alias definitions, and an __all__ declaration to specify module exports. All imported modules are from the Sanic framework, used for web server operations. There are no functions, input handling, or executable logic that could be exploited or manipulated maliciously. The use of __version__ and type aliases does not introduce security risks. No external data is read, and there are no potential data leaks or malicious code execution points.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module import and export setup for a Sanic web application. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is minimal, with no evident vulnerabilities.",
