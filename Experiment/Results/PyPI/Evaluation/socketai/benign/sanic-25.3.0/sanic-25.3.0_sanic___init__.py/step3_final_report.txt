{
  "purpose": "This code sets up import statements, type aliases, and an __all__ list for exporting components of the Sanic web framework, facilitating organized module structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the Sanic framework modules, including version info, app, blueprints, config, constants, exceptions, request, response, and websockets implementation.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only static import statements, type alias definitions, and an export list. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module setup for the Sanic framework, importing necessary components, defining type aliases, and specifying exports. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The imported modules are from the official Sanic package, and there are no dynamic or obfuscated elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module setup for a Sanic application, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
