  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely import statements, type alias definitions, and an __all__ export list.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network operations, or file I/O are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code is standard for setting up a module in a Sanic application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that there are no security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**  \n  None of the reports point out any errors or flaws. The code appears syntactically correct and follows standard practices.\n\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is benign, only import statements, no data flows.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, standard import/export setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.**  \n- The code is purely structural, facilitating imports and type aliasing for a Sanic application.\n- No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware is present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security concerns.",
