  "purpose": "To import and expose logging-related classes, functions, and constants from the Sanic framework for use in logging configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from sanic.logging modules: color, default, deprecation, filter, loggers",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output points; no sinks indicating potential data leakage or security impact",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and modular",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscated elements detected. The code is standard import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from Sanic's logging modules and re-exports them via __all__ for external use. All imported modules are part of the Sanic framework, a legitimate open-source web server library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs. The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain executable logic that could be exploited maliciously. The structure and format are straightforward, with no obfuscation or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module that exposes logging utilities from the Sanic framework. It presents no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
