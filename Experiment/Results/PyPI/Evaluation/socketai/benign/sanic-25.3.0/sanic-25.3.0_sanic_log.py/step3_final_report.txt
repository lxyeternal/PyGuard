  "purpose": "This code module imports specific logging components from the sanic.logging package and re-exports them for external use, serving as an organizational utility within the Sanic framework.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from sanic.logging modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; purely static code",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks as there are no dynamic operations",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports predefined components from the sanic.logging package and re-exports them via __all__, serving as a module for organizing logging utilities. There are no dynamic elements, network operations, or data processing. The code is static, clean, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module for organizing and exposing logging components. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
