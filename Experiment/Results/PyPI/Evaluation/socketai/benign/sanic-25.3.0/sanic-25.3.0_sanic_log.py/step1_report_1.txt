  "purpose": "Re-exporting logging components from the Sanic web framework for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from sanic.logging modules",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could be processed or leaked",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific logging-related objects from the Sanic framework and re-exports them via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that re-exports logging utilities from the Sanic framework. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
