{
  "purpose": "To export and organize logging-related classes, functions, and constants for the Sanic framework's logging module.",
  "sources": "Imports from various modules within sanic.logging: color, default, deprecation, filter, loggers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific components from Sanic's logging package and defines __all__ for exports. It functions as a module that re-exports selected symbols, which is standard practice for organizing package exports. No dynamic execution, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for organizing exports of logging utilities in Sanic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
