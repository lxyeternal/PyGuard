{
  "purpose": "This code implements an ASGI application interface for the Sanic web framework, managing server lifespan events, request creation, response handling, and WebSocket support.",
  "sources": "Scope headers parsing, receive messages for lifespan events, request data streaming, and WebSocket connection creation.",
  "sinks": "Sending lifespan startup/shutdown signals, response data transmission, WebSocket creation, and exception handling.",
  "flows": "Scope headers → request object; lifespan events → startup/shutdown handlers; request body chunks → response streams; WebSocket connection creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of warnings for UVLoop is non-malicious. No obfuscated code detected. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, managing server lifecycle and request/response flow. It correctly decodes headers, handles lifespan events, manages WebSocket connections, and ensures proper request streaming. Exception handling is appropriate, with no evident malicious patterns. No suspicious data leaks, external network calls, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard libraries and patterns consistent with a typical web framework implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly manages server events and request handling without any suspicious activity.",
