  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard ASGI implementation for Sanic, managing server startup/shutdown, request parsing, and response streaming. No malicious activity or backdoors detected. The warning about UVLoop is informational.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable given the benign analysis.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing lifecycle management, request handling, WebSocket support, and standard practices. No malicious activity or backdoors found.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent with the benign nature.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard ASGI handling, request parsing, lifecycle events, WebSocket support, no malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on correct handling of scope, lifecycle, WebSocket, and error management. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — fitting.\n\n- **Assessment:** No concerns here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard implementation, no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Warnings about event loop configuration are benign.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No. All reports agree the code is a standard, benign implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None apparent. All are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, with low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). These are reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as expected for such a server interface code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**. No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the comprehensive review and absence of issues, a **risk score of 0.1** is appropriate, possibly even lower, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis code is a typical, benign implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
