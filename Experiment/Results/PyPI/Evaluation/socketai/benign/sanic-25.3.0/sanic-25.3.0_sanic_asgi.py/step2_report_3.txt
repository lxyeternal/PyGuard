  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements an ASGI interface for Sanic, handling server startup/shutdown, request parsing, WebSocket support, response streaming, and error handling.\n- Uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- Contains benign warnings about UVLoop configuration, which are informational.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard ASGI implementation for Sanic, managing lifecycle, requests, responses.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses warnings.warn for event loop info, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard code.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** ASGI wrapper for Sanic, handling lifecycle, WebSocket, request, and response.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code or backdoors. Uses warnings for event loop, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Normal implementation, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** ASGI wrapper for Sanic, managing lifecycle, requests, responses.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Warnings are harmless.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** ASGI interface, lifecycle, WebSocket, request handling.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses warnings for UVLoop, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign code.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** ASGI lifecycle, request, WebSocket, response handling.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, data leaks, or suspicious activity. Warnings are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure code.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, managing server lifecycle, request parsing, WebSocket support, and response streaming.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** The assigned risk scores are very low (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor point is the warnings about UVLoop, which are informational and do not indicate security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear, standard, and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low; reflects minor informational warnings and standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns. The code is safe and appropriate for production environments.",
