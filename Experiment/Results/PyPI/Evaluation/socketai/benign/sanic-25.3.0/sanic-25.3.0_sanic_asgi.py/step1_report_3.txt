{
  "purpose": "The code implements an ASGI application wrapper for the Sanic framework, managing lifecycle events, request creation, and response handling in an ASGI server environment.",
  "sources": "Scope data (headers, raw_path, query_string), incoming messages via receive(), configuration options, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Sending responses via transport.send(), logging, exception handling, and warnings.",
  "flows": "Scope headers decoded -> Request object creation -> Lifecycle event triggers -> Request handling -> Response sending.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of warnings for event loop options is benign. No obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ASGI request handling with lifecycle management, request parsing, and response delivery for the Sanic framework. It decodes headers, manages websocket and HTTP scopes, and handles errors gracefully. No signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, secret exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of standard libraries and typical request processing flow indicates a legitimate implementation. The only notable aspect is the warning about UVLoop option, which is informational and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, legitimate part of the Sanic ASGI server implementation. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or security risks within this code snippet.",
