{
  "purpose": "This code defines an ASGI application wrapper for the Sanic web framework, managing server lifecycle events, request handling, and WebSocket connections within an ASGI server environment.",
  "sources": "Scope headers, incoming messages (lifespan.startup, lifespan.shutdown, HTTP requests, WebSocket connections), request data streams, environment configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Sending server lifecycle responses, request responses, WebSocket data, and error logs.",
  "flows": "Scope headers -> Request object creation -> Lifecycle event handling -> Request processing -> Response sending -> Server startup/shutdown events.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of warnings for event loop configuration is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard ASGI server lifecycle management and request handling procedures for Sanic, including WebSocket support. It processes incoming scope data, manages request state, and dispatches lifecycle events. Error handling is implemented via exception logging and response, with no suspicious data leaks or malicious code. The use of environment configuration warnings does not indicate malicious intent. The structure appears consistent with typical server application code, with no anomalies indicating malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, handling server lifecycle events and request processing securely. No malicious or sabotage indicators were identified.",
