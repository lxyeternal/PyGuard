  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard ASGI lifecycle handling, request parsing, response streaming.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Usage of warnings.warn is standard.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, managing server events, request lifecycle, and response handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The low security risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar focus on lifecycle, request, WebSocket support.\n- **Anomalies:** No backdoors or malicious code detected. Use of warnings is standard.\n- **Analysis:** Standard ASGI server lifecycle management, request handling, WebSocket support, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Focus on scope data, request creation, response.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard request processing, header decoding, error handling—nothing suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Normal, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Manages lifecycle, request, WebSocket.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Typical implementation, correct handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard lifecycle, request, WebSocket.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Follows standard patterns, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which matches the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or backdoors.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to informational warnings about event loop configuration, which are benign)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the security risk score is appropriately minimal.",
