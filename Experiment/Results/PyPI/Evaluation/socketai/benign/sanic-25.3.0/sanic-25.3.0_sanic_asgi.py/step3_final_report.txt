  "purpose": "Implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, managing server lifecycle events, request parsing, WebSocket support, and response streaming.",
  "sources": "Headers in scope, incoming messages from receive(), request data, scope data for URL and query string.",
  "sinks": "Response stream, transport send method, error logger, exception handling, and response headers.",
  "flows": "Scope headers -> Header decoding -> Request object creation -> Lifecycle event triggers -> Response streaming via transport -> Error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Warnings about UVLoop are informational.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, handling server startup/shutdown, request parsing, WebSocket connections, and response streaming. It uses standard patterns and libraries, with proper error handling and lifecycle management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The warnings about event loop configuration are benign. The code's structure and behavior align with expected practices for such server interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (0.1) scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
