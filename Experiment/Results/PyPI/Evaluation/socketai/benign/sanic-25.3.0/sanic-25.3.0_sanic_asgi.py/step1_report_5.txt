{
  "purpose": "This code defines the ASGI application interface and server lifecycle management for the Sanic web framework, including request handling, startup/shutdown procedures, and WebSocket support.",
  "sources": "Scope headers, request data, ASGI receive messages, and environment configurations.",
  "sinks": "Sending responses via transport, logging errors, raising exceptions for unknown scopes or header issues.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers, scope, messages) flow into request creation and lifecycle methods, then responses are sent via transport; exceptions are logged or cause errors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings to ignore event loop configuration; no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; standard request handling flow; no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ASGI server lifecycle and request handling for Sanic, including safe header processing and structured error handling. No signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity. It manages request-response lifecycle and WebSocket connections without suspicious operations. Use of warnings about event loop configuration indicates awareness of runtime environment, not malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of the Sanic ASGI server implementation, with no evident malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It follows standard patterns for request processing, lifecycle management, and WebSocket handling, with appropriate error handling and no suspicious data flows.",
