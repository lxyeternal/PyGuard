  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard ASGI interface for Sanic, handling startup, shutdown, request, and response flows. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation noted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; the code appears benign and standard.  \n- The risk score of 0.1 seems appropriate given the lack of suspicious activity.  \n- Malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is observed.  \n- The report's confidence (0.95) aligns with the thoroughness.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard lifecycle management, request handling, WebSocket support, no backdoors or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is consistent; no malicious patterns are evident.  \n- The slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable, perhaps reflecting a cautious stance on server lifecycle handling, but still low.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard implementation with proper handling, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is consistent; no malicious indicators.  \n- The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, managing server lifecycle, WebSocket, request parsing, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity detected.  \n- The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard ASGI server code, with safe header processing, lifecycle, WebSocket support, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is solid; no malicious or suspicious activity.  \n- The risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all within reasonable bounds given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of an ASGI interface for Sanic.\n- No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- The use of warnings for event loop configuration is standard and non-malicious.\n- The request and response flows follow expected patterns, with proper error handling.\n\n**Estimated scores based on overall review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a very low, acceptable risk level)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, standard, and secure. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
