It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The overall confidence in this assessment is high (0.9)."

The only minor concern relates to the handling of user-influenced data in headers/messages, which is a common consideration in web application development. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and functions as intended for error handling."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the import_string() function's potential misuse if external input is passed without validation. No actual malicious activity is present. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk ~0.2. Caution should be exercised if the import_string() function is used with untrusted data in broader application contexts."
