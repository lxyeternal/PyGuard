{
  "purpose": "Defines a Middleware class used for managing middleware functions in a Sanic web application framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads class variables, method arguments (func, location, priority), and the class attribute _counter.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted input; the class methods mostly manipulate internal data structures.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves initializing Middleware objects, converting collections, and resetting counters, with no external data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data structure for middleware management with typical features such as ordering, conversion, and counting. It relies on standard libraries and conventions without performing unsafe operations or external communications. No malicious behaviors or security risks are evident. The counter and conversion methods are straightforward and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of middleware management for Sanic, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured, primarily focusing on organizing middleware functions.",
