{
  "purpose": "Defines a Middleware class used to encapsulate middleware functions for the Sanic web framework, including management of middleware order and conversion.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (collections, enum, itertools, typing) and from sanic.models.handler_types.",
  "sinks": "The __call__ method invokes external middleware functions, which could potentially execute untrusted code if those functions are maliciously supplied.",
  "flows": "Middleware functions are stored and invoked via __call__, which executes the stored function; the convert method constructs Middleware objects from collections; reset_count resets internal counters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Usage of count for ordering is normal. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a Middleware class with methods for initialization, ordering, conversion, and resetting. It uses standard Python practices and external libraries without risky patterns. The invoke (__call__) method calls external functions, which is expected behavior in middleware systems but could be dangerous if supplied with malicious functions. However, the code itself does not contain any malicious behavior or suspicious features. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data leakage points are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structural component for middleware management in a web framework. It does not contain malicious or suspicious elements and appears to be standard and safe, assuming external middleware functions are trustworthy.",
