  "purpose": "Define a Middleware class for encapsulating middleware functions in a web framework, with support for prioritization and ordering.",
  "sources": "The class initializes with middleware functions passed as arguments, and the convert method processes collections of middleware.",
  "sinks": "No sinks directly present; no untrusted data handling or external interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "The convert method transforms collections of middleware into a deque, but does not process untrusted input or execute external code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is standard class and method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Middleware class with attributes and methods for ordering, conversion, and resetting a counter for middleware instances. It uses standard Python features, including auto-incrementing counters, enums, and collections. No external data is read or written, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious actions are present. The code is clean, well-structured, and appears to be a typical component of a web framework, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of middleware handling within a web framework, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and trustworthy.",
