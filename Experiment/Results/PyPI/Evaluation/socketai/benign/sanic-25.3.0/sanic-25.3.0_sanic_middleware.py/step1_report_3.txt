{
  "purpose": "Define a Middleware class for handling middleware functions within a Sanic web application framework, allowing registration, ordering, and conversion of middleware functions.",
  "sources": "Class methods, constructor, and property definitions that do not read external input; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data, perform sensitive actions, or involve external system calls.",
  "flows": "The code primarily creates and manages Middleware objects and their ordering; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python constructs for class definition, iteration, and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Middleware class with methods for creation, comparison, representation, and conversion of middleware functions. It manages an internal counter for ordering middleware and provides a method to reset this counter. All methods use standard Python features; no dynamic code execution, input reading, or network operations are present. The code appears to be part of a web framework infrastructure for middleware management, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of middleware handling within a web framework, with no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as intended for middleware management without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
