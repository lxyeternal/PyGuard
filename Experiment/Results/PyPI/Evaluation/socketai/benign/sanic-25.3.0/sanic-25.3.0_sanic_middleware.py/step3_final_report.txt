  "purpose": "Manage and order middleware functions within a web framework, supporting conversion and invocation.",
  "sources": "Middleware functions passed to the constructor or collection inputs in the convert method.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of middleware functions via __call__, which could execute external code.",
  "flows": "Middleware collection inputs -> Middleware instances -> __call__ invoking external functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; reliance on external functions is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Middleware class with ordering, conversion, and invocation capabilities. It does not read external data or perform system calls. The __call__ method executes external functions, which could be malicious if those functions are untrusted, but the code itself is straightforward and safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the structure and potential external function risks. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard middleware management utility with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The minor security risk stems from invoking external functions, which is typical in middleware systems but depends on external trustworthiness. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
