  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the presence of issues, the accuracy of the scoring, and any potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages routes, middleware, signals, etc., within Sanic. Reads from class attributes, function arguments, imported modules.\n- **Sinks:** Registration functions like `_apply_route`, `_apply_static`, `_apply_middleware`, etc., which integrate user handlers into the app.\n- **Flows:** Data from class attributes and parameters into registration functions and asyncio tasks.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard for web frameworks; no suspicious behavior. Uses asyncio properly, no data leaks or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate Sanic framework code; no malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Verdict:** The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on route/middleware management.\n- **Sinks:** Registration methods, decorators, and handler registration.\n- **Flows:** Data from user configurations/decorators into app registries.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard modular route/middleware management. No malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; code is typical for web frameworks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score is appropriate. No malware or obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages routes, middleware, signals, etc., in Sanic.\n- **Sinks:** Handler registration functions, decorators.\n- **Flows:** From method args into app registries.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Typical framework code; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** The low risk score is justified; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Organizes web app components, no direct data from untrusted sources.\n- **Sinks:** Registration of handlers, middleware, signals.\n- **Flows:** From handlers/decorators into app registries.\n- **Anomalies:** No backdoors or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard route/middleware management; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate framework code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** The low security risk score is appropriate. No malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar organization of routes, middleware, signals.\n- **Sinks:** Handler registration functions.\n- **Flows:** From user-defined handlers into app registries.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Typical web framework pattern; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** The low risk score is justified; no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior (score = 0).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected (score = 0).\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, which aligns with the code's nature as framework infrastructure code.\n\n**Overall,** the reports are consistent, accurate, and conservative in their security assessment. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard framework code)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is standard for web framework route/middleware management, with no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The low risk score reflects the minimal security concern inherent in such infrastructure code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's purpose and behavior.",
