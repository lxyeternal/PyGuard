  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate framework infrastructure code for organizing routes, middleware, signals, and static files in Sanic. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The overall confidence in this assessment is high (0.9)."
