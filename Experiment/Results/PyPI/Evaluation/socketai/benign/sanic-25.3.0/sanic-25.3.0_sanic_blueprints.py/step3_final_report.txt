{
  "purpose": "The code manages route registration, middleware, exception handling, signals, and static files within the Sanic web framework, facilitating modular organization of web app components.",
  "sources": "Class attributes and method parameters involved in registering routes, static files, middleware, signals, and exceptions; data flows into registration functions like '_apply_route', '_apply_static', and asyncio tasks for signal dispatching.",
  "sinks": "Registration functions such as '_apply_route', '_apply_static', '_apply_middleware', '_apply_exception_handler', '_apply_listener', '_apply_signal'; asyncio.create_task for signal waiters.",
  "flows": "Data from class attributes, method arguments, and decorators flow into registration functions and asyncio tasks, orchestrating the setup of web routes, static files, middleware, signals, and exception handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns detected; code appears to follow standard framework design.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of Sanic's blueprint and route management system. It uses decorators, class inheritance, and asyncio appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The registration methods interface with the Sanic app in expected ways, and signal handling employs asyncio tasks correctly. The data flows are confined within framework mechanisms, with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate framework infrastructure code for organizing routes, middleware, signals, and static files in Sanic. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The overall confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
