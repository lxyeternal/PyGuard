  "purpose": "Provide access to TensorBoard frontend assets packaged as a zip file.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ attribute to determine current file path; checks for existence of 'webfiles.zip' in the same directory.",
  "sinks": "Opens 'webfiles.zip' for reading if it exists, returning a file handle.",
  "flows": "Determines file path -> checks existence -> returns lambda that opens the file when called.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard pattern for loading static assets. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to locate and provide access to static frontend assets. It uses standard library functions to determine the path, check existence, and open the file. The lambda function is a common pattern for deferred file access. No input from untrusted sources is processed, and no external network or sensitive data handling occurs. The logger warns if the asset is missing but does not perform malicious actions. The code appears straightforward and typical for resource loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource loader for static assets with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply checks for a file and provides a callable to open it if present.",
