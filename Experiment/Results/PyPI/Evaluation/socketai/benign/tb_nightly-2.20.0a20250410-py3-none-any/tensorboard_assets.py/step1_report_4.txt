  "purpose": "Provides a method to access frontend assets for TensorBoard by returning a file handle to a zip archive if it exists.",
  "sources": "Reads the file path of 'webfiles.zip' based on the current script directory.",
  "sinks": "Returns a callable that opens and reads the zip file, which could potentially lead to file handling issues but not malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "get_default_assets_zip_provider() checks for file existence and, if present, returns a function that opens the file; if absent, logs a warning and returns None.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard file path handling and logging. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path to 'webfiles.zip' relative to its current directory. It checks for the existence of the file. If found, it returns a lambda function that opens the file in binary read mode. If not, it logs a warning and returns None. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. It functions as a simple asset loader for TensorBoard frontend files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard asset provider that safely handles the presence or absence of the 'webfiles.zip' file. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
