  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static asset loader with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs straightforward filesystem operations and provides access to static frontend assets. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
