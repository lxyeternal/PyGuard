  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve TensorBoard frontend assets as a ZIP archive if available.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, os.path.dirname, os.path.exists, open, logger.warning",
  "sinks": "open (for file reading), logger.warning (potential info leak if logs sensitive data)",
  "flows": "get_default_assets_zip_provider calls os.path.join and os.path.exists; if assets exist, lambda opens the ZIP file",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard Python libraries and well-documented functions",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path to 'webfiles.zip' based on the current file's directory, checks for its existence, and returns a lambda function to open the ZIP file if found. It logs a warning if the ZIP file is missing. The functions used are standard and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns. The file operations are straightforward, and no untrusted input is involved, nor is there any malicious data flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for loading static frontend assets for TensorBoard. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity detected. It performs expected filesystem checks and logging without any hidden actions.",
