{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to access frontend assets for TensorBoard by returning a file handle to a zip archive if it exists.",
  "sources": "Reads the current script's directory to locate 'webfiles.zip' and checks for its existence.",
  "sinks": "Returns a lambda that opens and reads the zip file; potential for file handle exposure if misused.",
  "flows": "Code checks for the existence of 'webfiles.zip' and, if present, the lambda returned can open and read this file when invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up a logger, constructs a path to 'webfiles.zip', verifies its existence, and returns a lambda that opens the file. The function appears to be a straightforward resource loader without malicious intent. There are no evident signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The lambda simply opens a local file when invoked. No insecure code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard resource loader for frontend assets with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as expected for a utility function, with no malicious intent evident.",
