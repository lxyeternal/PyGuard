  "purpose": "Utilities for TensorBoard command line interface, including server setup, port scanning, MIME type fixing, and signal handling.",
  "sources": "Command-line flags, socket states, environment variables, imported modules for server and socket management.",
  "sinks": "Network socket creation and binding, signal handling, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (flags, environment) lead to socket operations, server binding, and signal responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard server setup routines with port scanning, MIME type corrections, and signal handling. It uses typical socket operations, error handling, and server lifecycle management. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic aligns with legitimate server infrastructure code for TensorBoard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard server management code for TensorBoard, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to server setup complexity, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.",
