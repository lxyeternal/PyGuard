  "purpose": "Utilities and server implementations for running and managing the TensorBoard web application, including server setup, port handling, and signal management.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (argparse, os, sys, socket, threading, time, etc.), external packages (werkzeug), and internal tensorboard modules.",
  "sinks": "Server socket creation and binding, signal handling for process termination, logging, and HTTP request handling.",
  "flows": "Server setup reads configuration flags (e.g., port, host), creates socket connections, and manages server lifecycle; signal handlers catch termination signals; request handlers process HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for a web server setup; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks observed. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage detected. The port scanning logic for server binding may be considered advanced but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web server for TensorBoard using Werkzeug, including custom request handling, port scanning, and signal management. It imports standard and third-party modules for server operations. It manages socket options for IPv4/IPv6 support and handles common socket errors gracefully. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote control, or code injection are present. The server code performs expected functions for a web application with robust error handling. All functions appear purpose-built for server management, with no suspicious data flows or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate server management code for TensorBoard with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It efficiently manages server setup, port scanning, signal handling, and request processing without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
