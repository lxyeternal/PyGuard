  "purpose": "Utility functions for migrating legacy TensorFlow summaries/events, transforming protobuf Event objects and updating metadata for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads protobuf Event objects, including graph_def, tagged_run_metadata, and summary values.",
  "sinks": "In-memory protobuf message modifications; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads protobuf fields, updates data_class and tensor fields based on plugin type, and returns modified or new Event objects.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward protobuf manipulations with no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs protobuf message manipulations within the TensorFlow ecosystem, classifying data based on plugin names and updating data_class fields accordingly. It does not include external network calls, file I/O beyond protobuf processing, or obfuscated code. The functions are designed for internal data format migration, ensuring compatibility. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and uses standard protobuf operations. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified as a precaution, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for migrating TensorFlow event data. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). It is suitable for use within TensorFlow/TensorBoard workflows without concern for security vulnerabilities.",
