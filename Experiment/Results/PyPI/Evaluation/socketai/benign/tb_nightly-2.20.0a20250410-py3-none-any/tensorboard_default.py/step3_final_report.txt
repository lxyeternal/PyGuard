  "purpose": "Manage static and dynamic plugin loading for TensorBoard, allowing for custom and standard plugins to be registered and resolved.",
  "sources": "Import statements for plugin classes, pkg_resources.iter_entry_points for dynamic plugin resolution.",
  "sinks": "None; plugin classes are returned or resolved without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Static plugin list is returned directly; dynamic plugins are resolved via entry points and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard plugin management pattern; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for plugin management in Python, importing plugin classes and resolving entry points for dynamic plugins. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of pkg_resources.iter_entry_points is typical for plugin systems. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the environment-dependent trustworthiness of dynamically loaded plugins, which is acknowledged in the varying risk scores. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader for TensorBoard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of external plugins loaded via entry points, which is a common and accepted pattern. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.3 depending on the report), reflecting environmental trust assumptions.",
