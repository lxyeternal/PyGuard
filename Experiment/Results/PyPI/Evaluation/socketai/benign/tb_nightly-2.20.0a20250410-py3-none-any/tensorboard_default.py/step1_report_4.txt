{
  "purpose": "The code defines a collection and management system for first-party TensorBoard plugins, including static and dynamic plugin loading mechanisms.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports, plugin list definitions, and entry point resolution for dynamic plugins.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves static plugin list initialization and dynamic plugin resolution via entry points, returning plugin classes or loaders.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard plugin management and import statements. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports plugins and manages a list of static plugins. It provides functions to retrieve static and dynamic plugin lists, with dynamic plugins resolved via Python's entry points mechanism. There are no signs of malicious code, code injection, or data leakage. All operations are related to plugin management, with no external data manipulation or untrusted inputs processed beyond standard package entry point resolution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard plugin management module for TensorBoard, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions to organize plugin loading, with a clear and safe structure.",
