{
  "purpose": "The code defines a collection of TensorBoard plugins, including static and dynamic plugins, for use in the TensorBoard interface.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries (logging, pkg_resources), plugin modules, and entry points for dynamic plugins via pkg_resources.iter_entry_points.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; the code primarily loads plugin classes and entry points without executing or handling untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The static plugin list (_PLUGINS) is returned directly by get_static_plugins(). The get_dynamic_plugins() function resolves and loads entry points from the 'tensorboard_plugins' group using pkg_resources.iter_entry_points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior. The code performs straightforward plugin registration and loading. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a list of static plugins for TensorBoard. It uses pkg_resources to discover and load dynamic plugins via entry points, which is a standard extensibility method. The functions get_plugins(), get_static_plugins(), and get_dynamic_plugins() organize plugin loading, with no signs of malicious logic. The code maintains good practices, such as avoiding execution of untrusted data and simply resolving plugin classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader for TensorBoard, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly handles static and dynamic plugin loading using established methods. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
