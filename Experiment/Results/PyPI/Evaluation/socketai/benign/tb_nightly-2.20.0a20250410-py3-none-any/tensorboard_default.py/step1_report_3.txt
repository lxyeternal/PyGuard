{
  "purpose": "The code defines and manages TensorBoard plugins, including static and dynamic plugin loading, for enhancing TensorBoard's functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (tensorboard.plugins.*) and from Python's pkg_resources for dynamic plugin entry points.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output or network communication; it primarily loads plugins without untrusted input affecting system security.",
  "flows": "Plugins are loaded from static list (_PLUGINS) and dynamically resolved via entry points from package resources, returning combined plugin lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. Use of pkg_resources for dynamic plugin loading is standard for plugin systems.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard plugin collection and loader for TensorBoard, with no indication of malicious code. It imports plugins, manages a static list, and resolves plugins via entry points, all consistent with normal plugin management practices. No signs of data leaks, code injections, or suspicious network activity. The dynamic plugin resolution via pkg_resources is typical for extensible Python applications. The code maintains clear separation between static and dynamic plugins, with no suspicious operations or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign plugin collection and loader for TensorBoard. It performs typical plugin management tasks without any malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present.",
