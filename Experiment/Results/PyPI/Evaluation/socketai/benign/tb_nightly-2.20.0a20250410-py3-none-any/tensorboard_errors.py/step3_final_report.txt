  "purpose": "Defines custom error classes for handling error responses in TensorBoard, based on Google error codes.",
  "sources": "Input 'details' used in message formatting; 'challenge' parameter used in headers.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction with 'details'; headers in 'UnauthenticatedError'.",
  "flows": "Input 'details' -> message via _format_message; 'challenge' -> headers in 'UnauthenticatedError'.",
  "anomalies": "Potential info leakage if 'details' contains sensitive data, as it is directly included in messages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It uses standard patterns, with no external network activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is that 'details' are directly embedded in error messages, which could leak sensitive info if untrusted data is passed. The 'headers' are set appropriately in 'UnauthenticatedError'. The code does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature, with a cautious note regarding potential data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of error classes for API responses, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only consideration is to ensure 'details' are sanitized if originating from untrusted sources to prevent information leakage. Overall, the security risk is minimal.",
