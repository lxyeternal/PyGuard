  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom error classes for handling API errors, with standard message formatting and header management.\n- No external data fetching, network operations, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code appears straightforward and aligned with typical practices for error handling.\n- The 'malware' score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The only potential concern is in report 3, which notes that 'details' are directly included in error messages, possibly leading to information leakage if 'details' contain sensitive data. However, this is a standard pattern and not malicious; it is more of a cautionary note rather than a security flaw.\n\n**Assessment of code presence and behavior:**\n- The code is purely defining error classes; no malicious or suspicious code is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external dependencies, or obfuscated logic.\n- Headers are set only in the 'UnauthenticatedError' class, which is standard for such error types.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware score remains at 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- Risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the non-malicious, utility nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The overall security posture of this code is very high; it is a standard implementation of API error classes.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary based on the provided reports.\n- The only minor consideration is the potential for information leakage via 'details', but this is a common pattern and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly related to potential info leakage if 'details' contain sensitive info, but not a security flaw)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code appears safe, legitimate, and well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
