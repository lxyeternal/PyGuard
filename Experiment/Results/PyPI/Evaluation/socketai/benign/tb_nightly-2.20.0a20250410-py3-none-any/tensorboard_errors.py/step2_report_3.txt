  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for handling HTTP and API errors.\n   - It defines classes like `PublicError`, `InvalidArgumentError`, `NotFoundError`, `UnauthenticatedError`, and `PermissionDeniedError`.\n   - The `_format_message` function concatenates error details into messages.\n   - The `UnauthenticatedError` class appends a `WWW-Authenticate` header with a challenge string.\n   - No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n   **Conclusion:** There are no signs of malicious code or vulnerabilities in the actual implementation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard for error handling.\n   - One point to note is that including `details` directly in error messages via `_format_message` could potentially leak sensitive information if `details` contains confidential data. However, this is a common pattern, and the code comments specify that `PublicError` texts are assumed not to contain sensitive data.\n   - The reports correctly recognize that the code does not contain obfuscation or malware.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n   **Suggestion:** The scores appear reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues in the code justify a high risk score. The highest noted is 0.2, which is appropriate.\n   - The only potential concern is the inclusion of `details` in error messages, which could leak sensitive info if misused, but this is acknowledged and considered a minor security concern rather than a serious risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns, external data, or malicious behaviors.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal risk, mainly potential info leakage if `details` contain sensitive info)\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\nThe code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of custom error classes for an API context. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks present.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acknowledging minor potential info leakage if misused)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No further action or concern is warranted.",
