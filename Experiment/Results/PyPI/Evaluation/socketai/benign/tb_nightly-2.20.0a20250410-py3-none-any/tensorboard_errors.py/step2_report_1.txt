  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines custom error classes for handling error responses in TensorBoard, based on Google error codes.\n- Data flows: Input 'details' -> message formatting; headers appended only in 'UnauthenticatedError'.\n- Anomalies: None detected; no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Straightforward class definitions, safe message formatting, no external data or network activity.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, very low security risk.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (acceptable given the context).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining custom error classes.\n- Data flows: 'details' into message; 'challenge' into headers.\n- Anomalies: None observed.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes, safe handling.\n- Conclusion: No evidence of malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines error classes, with potential concern about 'details' being included directly in messages.\n- Data flows: 'details' into messages; 'challenge' into headers.\n- Anomalies: Potential info leakage if 'details' contains sensitive info, since it is directly embedded in error messages.\n- Analysis: While no malicious code, inclusion of untrusted 'details' in messages could leak sensitive data if misused.\n- Conclusion: No malware, but caution advised regarding data leakage.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (moderate due to potential info leakage).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, standard error class definitions.\n- Data flows: 'details' into messages; no suspicious activity.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, safe code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as others, defining error classes with HTTP status and headers.\n- Data flows: 'details' and 'challenge' into messages and headers.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Standard implementation, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe, with no malware.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports show no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or external data fetching. The code is purely defining error classes.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports have very low risk (0.1 or 0.2). The only slight concern is in report 3, where including 'details' directly in error messages could leak sensitive info if 'details' are untrusted.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, but with a note that including untrusted 'details' in messages could be a minor info leakage risk if misused.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be standard error handling classes used in API contexts, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only consideration is ensuring that 'details' passed to these classes are sanitized if they originate from untrusted sources, to prevent information leakage.\n\n**Overall Security Assessment:** Very low risk, no malware, no obfuscation, with a minor caution regarding data leakage potential.",
