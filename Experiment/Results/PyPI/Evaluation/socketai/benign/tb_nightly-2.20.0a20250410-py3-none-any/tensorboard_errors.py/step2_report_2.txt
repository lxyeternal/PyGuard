  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code only defines error classes; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  None. The logic is straightforward, and the implementation aligns with standard practices.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Security risk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly high given the code's benign nature; could be lowered to 0.0.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk score?**  \n  The score of 0.1 seems overly cautious. Since the code is purely defining error classes with no external dependencies or data handling, the risk should be minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Same as above, purely defining error classes.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Security risk: 0 — consistent with the code.\n\n- **Conclusion**  \n  The report's assessment is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Potential concern: inclusion of 'details' directly in error messages via `_format_message`. If 'details' contain sensitive info, this could lead to information leakage.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The code does not sanitize or restrict 'details'. While this is standard in many error message formats, it could be a security concern if 'details' are untrusted.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Security risk: 0.2 — perhaps slightly high, but considering the potential for info leakage, a cautious score is justified.\n\n- **Justification?**  \n  Since 'details' are directly included in error messages, if an attacker supplies sensitive info as 'details', it could leak. The report notes this potential but doesn't classify it as malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Security risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Security risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward implementation of custom error classes.\n- The only point of concern is in Report 3, where the inclusion of 'details' directly into error messages could potentially leak sensitive information if misused. This is a common pattern but warrants caution.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious behavior is observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for information leakage via 'details', I would assign a **risk score of 0.1 to 0.2** for the code as a whole, primarily due to the handling of 'details'. However, since this is standard practice, and not inherently malicious, I lean towards **0.1**.\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The only consideration is the handling of user-provided 'details' in error messages, which could be a security concern if 'details' contain sensitive data.\n- Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe for use in production with proper caution regarding error message content.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 to 0.2      |\n\nThis reflects a low-risk, standard error handling implementation with a minor caveat about message content.",
