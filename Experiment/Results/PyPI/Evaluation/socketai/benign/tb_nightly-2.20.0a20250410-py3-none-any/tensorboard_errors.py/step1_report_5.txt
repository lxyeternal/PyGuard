{
  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for handling specific error conditions in a TensorFlow-related application, with proper HTTP status codes and headers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class constructors, especially 'details' and 'challenge' in 'UnauthenticatedError'. No external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "Generation of error messages via _format_message function; setting of HTTP headers like 'WWW-Authenticate' in 'UnauthenticatedError'.",
  "flows": "Constructor inputs ('details', 'challenge') flow into error messages and headers; these are used in HTTP responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs present. The code primarily defines classes and simple functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom error classes inheriting from RuntimeError, with associated HTTP status codes and optional headers. Error messages are formatted based on input parameters, with no external data input or suspicious logic. The inclusion of 'WWW-Authenticate' header in 'UnauthenticatedError' aligns with standard HTTP practices and RFC specifications. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or malicious data flows. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of custom error classes intended for API error handling. No malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
