{
  "purpose": "Defines custom error classes for handling and formatting various public errors in a TensorFlow-related application.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, particularly in __init__ methods where error messages and headers are set.",
  "targets": "Error messages and HTTP headers for HTTP responses.",
  "flows": "Error details are passed to class constructors, which format messages and append headers; these are then used in HTTP responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for error handling with no external input handling or network operations. It formats messages and sets headers, including the WWW-Authenticate challenge for unauthenticated errors. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code is purely for exception management, with no external dependencies or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining error classes with proper message formatting and header management. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, safe module intended for use within a larger application.",
