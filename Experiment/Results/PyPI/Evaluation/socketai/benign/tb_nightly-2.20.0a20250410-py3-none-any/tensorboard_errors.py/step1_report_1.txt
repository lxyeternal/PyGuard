  "purpose": "Defines custom error classes for handling various HTTP and API error responses within the TensorBoard core application, specifically related to Google error codes.",
  "sources": "Error message inputs to class constructors, particularly the 'details' parameter for customizing error messages.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in '_format_message', appending headers in 'UnauthenticatedError' class.",
  "flows": "Input 'details' -> '_format_message' -> error message; 'challenge' -> header in 'UnauthenticatedError' -> HTTP response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, external data fetching, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely implements custom exception classes for API error handling, with standard class inheritance, message formatting, and header management. The 'headers' attribute is manipulated only within class context, particularly in 'UnauthenticatedError' where a 'WWW-Authenticate' challenge is added. All data handling appears safe and typical for such error classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. No external network operations, credential handling, or obfuscated logic is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and conforms to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely functional, defining error classes for error handling in a web API context. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
