  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for handling various HTTP and API error responses in a TensorFlow-related application.",
  "sources": "None; all code consists of class definitions and functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows, input/output handling, or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; code appears to be standard error class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes inheriting from RuntimeError, used for handling specific HTTP and API error scenarios. The classes include PublicError and its subclasses for various HTTP error codes, with appropriate headers and message formatting. The _format_message helper constructs messages based on provided details. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are consistent with standard error handling in Python. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present. The code is clean, straightforward, and appears to serve a utility purpose in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom error classes for HTTP and API error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious and is safe for use. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
