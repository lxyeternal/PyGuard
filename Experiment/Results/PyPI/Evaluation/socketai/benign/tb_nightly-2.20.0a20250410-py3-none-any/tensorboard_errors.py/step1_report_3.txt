  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for handling HTTP error responses with associated status codes and headers, used in TensorFlow-related applications.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their methods, particularly constructors (__init__) and the helper function _format_message.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection point in _format_message where 'details' is included in error messages; headers list in UnauthenticatedError.",
  "flows": "Input 'details' flows into the error message generation, and in UnauthenticatedError, 'challenge' flows into the headers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'details' directly in error messages could lead to information leakage if 'details' contains sensitive data; no other suspicious or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom error classes inheriting from RuntimeError, intended for structured HTTP error responses. The _format_message function concatenates error details into message strings, which could potentially leak sensitive info if 'details' are untrusted or sensitive. The UnauthenticatedError class appends an HTTP header 'WWW-Authenticate' with the 'challenge' parameter, which is standard. No external inputs are directly read, and there are no suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Usage of class attributes and constructor parameters is straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom error classes for HTTP responses. It does not exhibit malicious intent, but caution should be exercised if 'details' contains sensitive data, as it is included directly in messages. Overall, there is no malware or malicious behavior detected, only potential information leakage if misused.",
