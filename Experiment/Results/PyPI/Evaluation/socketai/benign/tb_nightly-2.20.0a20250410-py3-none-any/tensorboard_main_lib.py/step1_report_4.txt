  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for initializing TensorBoard environment settings and handling deprecated commands.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system arguments, and imports modules (os, sys, absl.logging, tensorboard.compat.tf).",
  "sinks": "Modifies environment variable 'GCS_READ_CACHE_DISABLED', writes to sys.stderr, and calls sys.exit().",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting and argument checking influence log behavior and process termination, respectively.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code performs expected environment setup and command handling without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets an environment variable to disable GCS caching, which is a standard practice for stability. It checks TensorFlow version and warns if not found. It also intercepts the 'tensorboard dev' command and prints a shutdown message before exiting, which is consistent with the documented deprecation of that feature. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code are present. The operations involve environment setup, logging configuration, and command interception, all typical for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup helper for TensorBoard with no malicious behavior. It performs environment configuration, version checks, and command handling as intended. No security risks or malware detected.",
