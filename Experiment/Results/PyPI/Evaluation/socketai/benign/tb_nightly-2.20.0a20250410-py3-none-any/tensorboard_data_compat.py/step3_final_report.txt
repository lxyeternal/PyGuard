  "purpose": "Utility functions for migrating legacy TensorBoard protobuf summary data to their modern formats, ensuring backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads protobuf summary events and values, processes data internally without external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Creates new protobuf Summary.Value objects; no external communication or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Extracts data from event.summary.value, processes via handler functions, and constructs new protobuf summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external side effects detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward protobuf data transformation, converting old-style summary values to new-style, including histogram, image, audio, and scalar types. It uses standard libraries (numpy, protobuf) appropriately, with no network activity or obfuscation. The functions handle data conversion and metadata creation securely. No malicious behavior or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for protobuf data migration within TensorBoard, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are accurate and justified.",
