  "purpose": "Utilities for migrating legacy TensorBoard summary proto data to a modern format, ensuring compatibility and consistency in tensor data representation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the `event` object passed to `migrate_event`, and `value` objects passed to `migrate_value`, `make_summary`, and internal helper functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is transformed and stored into `Summary.Value` protobuf messages; no direct writing or network transmission occurs within this code. No untrusted output or data leakage points are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input from `event.summary.value` flows through `migrate_value`, which may invoke specific handlers (`_migrate_*_value`) to produce new `Summary.Value` objects, which are then assembled into new `Summary` messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code relies solely on standard protobuf manipulation and numpy for data processing. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data migration of protobuf-based summary values for TensorBoard, transforming old-style data into new formats for visualization. It uses numpy for array manipulation and straightforward protobuf field handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious network activity. All operations are related to data transformation and protobuf message construction. No hardcoded secrets or risky code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for migrating data formats within TensorBoard and does not contain malicious intent. It handles data transformation securely, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
