  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of lazy module loading for TensorBoard with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (e.g., 0 or 0.1) due to the minimal dynamic import mechanics involved."
