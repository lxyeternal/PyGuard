{
  "purpose": "Provides lazy-loaded access to TensorBoard modules and IPython extension integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements, lazy loading functions, module attributes, and the load_ipython_extension function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Import functions (`errors()`, `notebook()`, `program()`, `summary()`) dynamically load modules when called; `load_ipython_extension` calls a lazy-loaded function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy loading via `importlib.import_module` is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Comments are extensive but normal for module explanations.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for module management, utilizing lazy loading to defer imports until needed. It includes safeguards against module reload issues. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The code adheres to good practices for dynamic import management, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for TensorBoard's Python package, focusing on lazy imports and IPython integration. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
