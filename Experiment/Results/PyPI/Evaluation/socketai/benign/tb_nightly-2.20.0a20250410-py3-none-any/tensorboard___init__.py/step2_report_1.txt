  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior:**\n   - The code implements lazy loading of TensorBoard submodules using `importlib.import_module` within functions decorated with `_lazy.lazy_load`.\n   - It also provides an `load_ipython_extension` function to integrate with IPython, calling a method `_load_ipython_extension` on the `notebook` submodule.\n   - The code is heavily documented, explaining module reloading behaviors and the rationale for lazy imports.\n   - There are no indications of data handling, network communication, or execution of untrusted code based on user input.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n   - The import statements are static strings used solely for module importation.\n   - The `load_ipython_extension` interacts only with the submodule API, not executing arbitrary code.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as standard, well-documented, and employing common patterns for lazy loading.\n   - No report indicates any suspicious or malicious activity.\n   - The use of `importlib.import_module` with fixed module names is standard practice.\n   - The comments about module reloading are for documentation and do not suggest malicious intent.\n   - The only minor anomaly noted is a `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 4, but given the static nature of module names and no user input, this is likely an overestimation.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, well-documented code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. Slightly elevated risk scores (like 0.1) in some reports seem to be overestimations.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n   - The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation for module lazy loading within TensorBoard.\n   - No signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable, though the minor security risk score could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.05 if a very conservative estimate)\n\nThis code is safe, standard infrastructure code, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected.",
