  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing multiple TensorBoard processes, including starting, tracking, and reusing instances.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., TENSORBOARD_BINARY), subprocess calls, file I/O for info files, temp directories for storing process info.",
  "sinks": "Reading info files, subprocess outputs, environment variables; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and arguments influence subprocess invocation; info files are written/read to track process info; process status checked via polling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad permissions (0o777) on temp info directory; no validation of subprocess output; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages process lifecycle via subprocess, serializes process info into JSON, uses environment variables for binary selection, and stores info in temp files. No malicious patterns, no obfuscated code, and no network activity. Minor security concern about permissions on temp directories, but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing TensorBoard processes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The high malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The risk score could be slightly increased due to directory permissions but remains low. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
