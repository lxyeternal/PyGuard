  "purpose": "Utilities for managing multiple TensorBoard processes, including starting, monitoring, and storing process info.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., TENSORBOARD_BINARY), system files (info files in temp directory), and process parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes info files to temporary directories, reads info from disk, spawns subprocesses to launch TensorBoard, reads stdout and stderr files.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable to determine binary, spawns subprocess with arguments, writes process info to disk, reads info files for existing processes, and reads stdout/stderr for process output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses temporary files and directories for info and stdout/stderr, relies on file permissions, and does not explicitly validate subprocess output content; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code manages TensorBoard processes via subprocess and file I/O, with mechanisms for process reuse and info persistence. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions. The process launching and info storage are standard for process management utilities. No suspicious network activity or code injection detected. Use of environment variables and temporary files is typical for such tooling. Overall, the code appears legitimate and designed for process management, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for managing TensorBoard processes. It uses standard Python features for subprocess control and file management without signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No security risks or malware are evident.",
