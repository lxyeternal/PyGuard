  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing multiple TensorBoard server instances, including starting, monitoring, and retrieving info about running processes.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., TENSORBOARD_BINARY), reading and writing info files, listing info directory, reading process output files, reading process status via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Writing info files, executing subprocesses, reading process output files, reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable TENSORBOARD_BINARY influences subprocess command; subprocess.Popen is used to start processes; info files read to gather process info; environment variables and info files are used for process management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code detected. The code appears standard for process management and file I/O. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for managing TensorBoard processes, including starting processes, reusing existing ones, reading/writing process info to files, and cleaning up files. It utilizes environment variables to determine the binary to run and manages process lifecycle via subprocess.Popen. It reads info files from a temporary directory, parses JSON, and uses base64 encoding for cache keys. The process launching includes error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data theft, network communication, backdoors, or code obfuscation. The code follows standard practices for process and file management, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate utility for managing TensorBoard instances with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily handles process lifecycle, info management, and process reuse. The code appears safe and aligns with expected functionality for a server management utility.",
