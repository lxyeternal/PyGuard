  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing multiple TensorBoard processes, including starting, monitoring, and storing process info.",
  "sources": "File operations (_get_info_file_path, write_info_file, get_all), environment variables (os.environ), subprocess creation (subprocess.Popen).",
  "sinks": "Reading/writing info files, environment variables (TENSORBOARD_BINARY), subprocess outputs, and process IDs.",
  "flows": "Start function computes cache key from current directory and arguments, attempts to find existing process, or launches new process; process info written to temp files; info read from files for monitoring.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Usage of temp files and subprocesses appears standard. No obfuscated code or obfuscation techniques detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages TensorBoard processes by creating, monitoring, and cleaning info files in temporary directories. It uses standard Python modules for file and process management, and environment variables for optional binary specification. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communications are present. The use of temporary files and process management is typical for such utilities. No suspicious code flow or anomalies found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard process management utility for TensorBoard, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles process launching, info storage, and reuse logic securely and transparently.",
