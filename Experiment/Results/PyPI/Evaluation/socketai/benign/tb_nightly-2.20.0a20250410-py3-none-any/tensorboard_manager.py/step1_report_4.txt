  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing, storing, and retrieving information about TensorBoard processes, including starting, reusing, and monitoring them.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., TENSORBOARD_BINARY), system calls to subprocess.Popen, file reads/writes from temporary info files, and user-supplied arguments.",
  "sinks": "Process creation via subprocess.Popen, file writing/reading for info files, and reading environment variables that influence process execution.",
  "flows": "Arguments and environment variables influence subprocess invocation. The process info is stored/read from temp files. The info files are parsed back into data structures for process monitoring.",
  "anomalies": "Use of temp directories with broad permissions (0o777), no validation of subprocess outputs beyond existence, no explicit checks for malicious command execution, and the reliance on environment variables without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions for process management and data serialization/deserialization. It uses standard Python modules and common patterns. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic. The use of tempfile with broad permissions could be a security concern but is not malicious per se. Environment variables are read but not exploited maliciously. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for process and info management of TensorBoard instances. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Its design is typical for managing external processes and associated data. Slight concerns about permissions and environment variable usage are noted but do not indicate malicious intent.",
