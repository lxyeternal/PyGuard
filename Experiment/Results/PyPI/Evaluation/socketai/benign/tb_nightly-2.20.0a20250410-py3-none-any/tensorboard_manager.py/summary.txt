  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing TensorBoard processes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The high malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The risk score could be slightly increased due to directory permissions but remains low. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
