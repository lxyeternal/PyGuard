  "purpose": "Utilities for embedding, launching, and managing TensorBoard instances in notebook environments (Colab, Jupyter) and command-line interfaces, including environment detection and display handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'TENSORBOARD_PROXY_URL'), user input via args, external 'manager' module for process control, IPython display APIs for embedding.",
  "sinks": "Console output, IPython display updates, HTML/JavaScript injection for notebook rendering, process management calls.",
  "flows": "Environment detection functions determine context; user commands invoke 'start' which calls 'manager.start'; display functions embed TensorBoard UI via IPython APIs or links; environment variables influence proxy setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; code is straightforward and uses standard APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection (Colab, IPython, CLI), manages TensorBoard processes via an external 'manager', and embeds or links to TensorBoard UI. It uses environment variables for proxy configuration, which is standard. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The display functions correctly handle different environments, and the process management appears legitimate. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code for TensorBoard integration in notebooks and CLI environments. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
