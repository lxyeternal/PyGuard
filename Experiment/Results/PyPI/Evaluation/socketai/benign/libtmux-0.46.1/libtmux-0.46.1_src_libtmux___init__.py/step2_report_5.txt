  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package initialization module.\n- No evidence of data handling, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The code simply imports metadata and core classes, then exposes them via `__all__`.\n\n**Specific Analysis:**\n- The code matches typical Python package `__init__.py` structure.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- No suspicious constructs or behaviors are present.\n- The metadata is imported from a local `__about__` module, which is standard practice.\n- The core classes (`Pane`, `Server`, `Session`, `Window`) are imported from local modules, with no indication of malicious code.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risks identified.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Given the content, there are no assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities that are unsubstantiated.\n- The reports are consistent with the code being benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard package setup.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe package initialization script with no security concerns.",
