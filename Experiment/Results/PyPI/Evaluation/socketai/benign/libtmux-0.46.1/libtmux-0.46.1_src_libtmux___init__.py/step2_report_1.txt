  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` or package setup script.\n- It imports package metadata from `__about__`.\n- It imports core classes (`Pane`, `Server`, `Session`, `Window`) from local modules.\n- It defines `__all__` to expose these components.\n- No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data processing is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. This aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Are there any flaws or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as a standard package initializer.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which makes sense.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or risky.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities and Assumptions:\n- The reports assume that `__about__` contains only metadata and that the imported classes are safe.  \n- Given the minimal code, these assumptions are reasonable.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment and scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical package setup script, importing static metadata and core classes, with no data flow, no user input, no external communication, and no suspicious constructs. The scores assigned are appropriate and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.",
