  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code in question is a typical package initialization (__init__.py) file.\n- It imports package metadata from a local __about__ module.\n- It imports core classes (Pane, Server, Session, Window) from local modules.\n- It defines __all__ to specify the public API.\n- No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data processing is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and without security risks.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious elements.\n- Since the code is only about exposing package components and metadata, there's no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n- No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no security concerns.",
