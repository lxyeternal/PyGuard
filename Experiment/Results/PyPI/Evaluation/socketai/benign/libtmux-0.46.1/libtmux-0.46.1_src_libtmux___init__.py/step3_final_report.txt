{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing metadata and core classes to define the public API of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '__about__' for metadata and imports classes from local modules ('pane', 'server', 'session', 'window').",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing metadata and classes to defining '__all__' for module exports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard '__init__.py' for a Python package, importing static metadata and core classes, then exposing them via '__all__'. It contains no user input, network activity, dynamic execution, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's content.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
