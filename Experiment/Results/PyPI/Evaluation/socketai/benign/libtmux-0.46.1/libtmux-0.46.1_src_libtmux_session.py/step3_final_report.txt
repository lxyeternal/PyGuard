  "purpose": "Provides a Python API wrapper for managing tmux sessions, including creation, querying, modification, and control of sessions, windows, and panes.",
  "sources": "User parameters, method arguments, command outputs from tmux via self.cmd(), fetch functions for objects.",
  "sinks": "Execution of tmux commands through self.cmd() with parameters that could originate from external or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "User or external inputs influence command parameters; command outputs are parsed into internal objects for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Use of warnings for deprecated methods is standard maintenance practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard API wrapper around tmux commands, executing commands with controlled parameters. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage indicators are present. The command execution relies on inputs that, if sanitized externally, pose minimal risk. The extensive validation and error handling further reduce potential vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent interface for tmux session management with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to command execution potential if inputs are malicious, but current controls appear sufficient.",
