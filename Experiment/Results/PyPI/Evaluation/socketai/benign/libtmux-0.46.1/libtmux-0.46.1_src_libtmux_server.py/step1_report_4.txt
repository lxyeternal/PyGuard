{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python interface to interact with a tmux server, managing sessions, windows, and panes programmatically.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (TMUX_TMPDIR, TMUX), executes subprocess commands (tmux CLI commands), reads properties from fetch_objs, and processes command outputs.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls for commands like 'list-sessions', 'kill-server', 'new-session', 'has-session', etc., and environment variable modifications (os.environ).",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables or method parameters -> subprocess commands via self.cmd() -> outputs processed into Python objects or returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of subprocess with dynamic command construction is standard for such APIs. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names detected. Warnings are for deprecated methods, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around the tmux CLI, issuing commands and parsing output into Python objects. It handles environment variables carefully, cleans up environment state before and after commands, and raises specific exceptions for errors. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The subprocess calls are used for standard tmux operations. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling mechanisms are present. Deprecated warnings indicate code maintenance, not malicious behavior. Overall, the code is a standard, well-structured interface for managing tmux sessions, with no evidence of malware or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate API wrapper for tmux, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It performs typical subprocess interactions, environment handling, and object management. The presence of deprecated methods and warnings are part of normal code evolution and do not indicate malicious intent.",
