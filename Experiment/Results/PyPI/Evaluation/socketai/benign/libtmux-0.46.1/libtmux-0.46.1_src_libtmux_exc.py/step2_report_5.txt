  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes for the libtmux library.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network I/O.\n   - Exception messages are constructed from parameters, but these are used only for descriptive purposes.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling and contains no malicious or suspicious logic.\n   - They emphasize the absence of data flow from untrusted sources, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0.\n   - These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n   - Exception classes are standard and contain no malicious behavior.\n   - The highest risk here is minimal—strictly related to internal error reporting.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they analyze the code's structure and behavior.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions used within the libtmux library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risking elements. The reports' assessments are accurate and well-founded.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's nature as purely structural, error-handling classes with no security concerns.",
