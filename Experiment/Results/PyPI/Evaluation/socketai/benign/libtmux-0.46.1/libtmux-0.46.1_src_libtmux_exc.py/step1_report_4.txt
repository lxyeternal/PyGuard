{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for libtmux, a Python library for interacting with tmux.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, internal modules, and type annotations. No external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation and message formatting functions; no data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Code flows from exception class definitions and initializations; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. Exception messages are standard and descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with specific error messages related to tmux sessions and options. No user input, external data, or network operations are present. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators, with optional message customization. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign collection of exception class definitions for error handling in libtmux. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears standard and safe.",
