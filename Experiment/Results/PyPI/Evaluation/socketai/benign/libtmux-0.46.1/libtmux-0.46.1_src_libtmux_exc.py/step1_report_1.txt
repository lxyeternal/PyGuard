{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the libtmux library to handle various error conditions related to tmux sessions, windows, panes, options, and other internal states.",
  "sources": "None (the code primarily defines exception classes and their initializers).",
  "sinks": "None (no data flows from untrusted sources; this code does not process user input or perform IO operations).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data processing or flow control present).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs identified. The code strictly defines exception classes with descriptive messages.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises class definitions extending base exception classes, with some constructors customizing error messages. There are no data inputs, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The code is static and purely for error handling. It uses standard Python exception patterns, with clear and consistent message construction. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the libtmux library, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for error reporting and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
