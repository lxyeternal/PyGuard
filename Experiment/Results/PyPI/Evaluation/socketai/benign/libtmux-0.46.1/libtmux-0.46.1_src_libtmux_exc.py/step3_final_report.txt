{
  "purpose": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for libtmux, handling various error conditions such as session, window, pane errors, and option issues. It serves as an internal error management module.",
  "sources": "The constructors and class definitions where error messages are formatted based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting within exception constructors; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to exception constructors flow into formatted error messages, but these are controlled and not from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exceptions, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. Exception messages are simple and controlled. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The exception constructors format messages based on parameters, but these are used solely for debugging and error reporting. The structure is standard for error handling modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for libtmux, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
