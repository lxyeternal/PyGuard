  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for libtmux to handle various error scenarios in tmux interactions.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializations and message constructions; import statements for internal modules.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with dynamic messages based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Code raises exceptions with formatted strings possibly containing input data; no direct data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code only defines exception classes and does not perform data processing or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for error handling within the libtmux library. It uses typical Python practices such as class inheritance, formatted error messages, and optional parameters. No data input handling, network operations, or code execution is present. The only dynamic aspects are message formatting in exception constructors, which do not pose security risks. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, and no obfuscated or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for libtmux error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as part of a larger, legitimate library infrastructure.",
