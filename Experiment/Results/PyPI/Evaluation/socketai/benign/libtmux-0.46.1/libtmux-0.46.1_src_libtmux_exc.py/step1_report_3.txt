  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling various errors in the libtmux library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, exception class definitions, and constructor methods that generate error messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages generated and potentially raised during runtime; no direct data leaks or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes leads to raising exceptions with messages; no untrusted data flows into sinks in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. Exception classes and message handling are standard. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the libtmux library, with clear and straightforward constructors. No data from external or untrusted sources appears to be processed or transmitted. The exception messages are static or constructed from provided arguments, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code serves purely as error handling infrastructure without any embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions used for error handling within the libtmux library. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for such error management modules.",
