  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the code content, potential security implications, and the consistency of the provided scores.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n- The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no data processing, network operations, dynamic code execution, or external input handling.\n- Exception constructors do format messages, sometimes including parameters, but these are controlled and not sourced from untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n- The code appears well-structured and follows standard Python exception class patterns.\n- No evident errors or flawed logic.\n- The exception messages are descriptive and helpful for debugging.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the code's straightforward nature.\n- Risk scores are 0 or very low, consistent with the code's static, error-defining purpose.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Since the code is only defining exception classes with no dynamic or external data processing, risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors are evident.\n\n**5. Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0, as the code is clear and readable.\n\n**6. Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they note that the code only defines exception classes.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a static, well-structured set of exception class definitions, serving error handling purposes within the libtmux library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no security concerns or malicious behaviors in this code. It is safe, standard, and serves its purpose as an error handling module.",
