  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step, to ensure the assessment is accurate and consistent.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to libtmux.\n- No data processing, network communication, dynamic code execution, or input handling is present.\n- Exception messages are static or constructed from controlled parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic are evident.\n\n**2. Logical and Structural Review:**\n- The exception classes extend standard Python exceptions or other custom exceptions.\n- Constructors are used mainly to format descriptive error messages.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, maintainable, and typical for error handling modules.\n\n**3. Consistency of Scores and Risk Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified because the code is static, with no external dependencies or operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**4. Potential for Vulnerabilities or Exploits:**\n- Since the code only defines exception classes, it cannot be exploited directly.\n- The only dynamic aspect is message formatting, which is controlled and not dangerous.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n**5. Scores for individual issues:**\n- The scores given (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are consistent with the code content.\n\n**6. Final Personal Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for libtmux. It is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- No issues are present.\n- The reasoning in all reports is correct.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code poses no security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores; no changes needed.",
