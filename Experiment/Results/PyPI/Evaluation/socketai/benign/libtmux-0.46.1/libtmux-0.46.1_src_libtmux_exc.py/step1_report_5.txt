{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for the libtmux library, providing specific error handling for tmux-related issues.",
  "sources": "None (exceptions are raised internally within the library); no external input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "None (exceptions are used for control flow, no data sinks involved).",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exceptions are instantiated with static or controlled messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward exception class definitions with no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes for error handling within the libtmux library. There are no functions executing untrusted data, no network calls, no file operations, or any other potentially malicious activity. The constructors mainly format error messages, sometimes including parameters, but these parameters are controlled and used for descriptive purposes only. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not read external data or perform operations that could be exploited. Overall, the code appears safe and purely for internal error handling.",
