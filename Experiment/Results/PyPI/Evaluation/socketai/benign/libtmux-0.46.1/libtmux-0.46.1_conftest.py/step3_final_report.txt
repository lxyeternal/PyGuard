  "purpose": "Setup pytest fixtures for testing tmux environment, managing environment variables, and injecting fixtures into doctest namespace.",
  "sources": "shutil.which('tmux') check, environment variable via monkeypatch, request.getfixturevalue calls",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'HOME' modification, fixture retrievals, namespace injections",
  "flows": "System check -> environment variable patch -> fixture retrieval -> namespace injection",
  "anomalies": "Use of request.getfixturevalue could invoke arbitrary fixtures; no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pytest environment setup, environment variable patching, and fixture injection. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The reliance on external fixtures via getfixturevalue is typical but could pose risks if fixtures are malicious; however, this is outside the scope of this code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest fixture setup for testing tmux environments. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external fixture invocation, which is typical in testing frameworks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
