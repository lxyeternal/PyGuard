  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest fixture setup for testing tmux environments. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external fixture invocation, which is typical in testing frameworks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1)."
