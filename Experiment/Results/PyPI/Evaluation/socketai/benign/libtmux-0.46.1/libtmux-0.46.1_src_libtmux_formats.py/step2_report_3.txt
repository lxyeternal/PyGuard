  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code defines static lists of format string constants for tmux objects (sessions, clients, windows, panes).\n- It reads an environment variable `LIBTMUX_TMUX_FORMAT_SEPARATOR` to set a separator string, defaulting to a Unicode character.\n- There are no functions, dynamic code execution, user inputs, or network activity.\n- The code appears purely declarative, serving as configuration/constants.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Correctly identifies that the code is a static configuration module.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The environment variable is used straightforwardly.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scoring are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms straightforward environment variable usage.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same conclusion: static configuration, safe environment variable access.\n- No dynamic code, no user input, no external effects.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same as above; straightforward configuration with environment variable for separator.\n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Slight variation: uses a default Unicode separator (`\"\\u241e\"`), but still safe.\n- No dynamic code or untrusted data processing.\n- No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Critical Review**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration module.\n- No report overstates or underestimates risks.\n- The environment variable usage is standard and safe.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment and Recommendations**\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely static configuration with environment variable customization, there is no basis for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, safe, and standard for configuration purposes. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the observed code and the detailed reasoning.",
