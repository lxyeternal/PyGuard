  "purpose": "Define constants and format strings for tmux objects, with a configurable separator.",
  "sources": "Environment variable LIBTMUX_TMUX_FORMAT_SEPARATOR; static list definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or output.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read influences FORMAT_SEPARATOR; no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module defining constants for tmux formats. It reads an environment variable for separator customization, which is used safely and straightforwardly. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, user inputs, or network activity. The environment variable is used only for setting a separator string, with a default fallback. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for tmux, with safe environment variable usage. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The environment variable is used solely for customization, and the code does not process untrusted data or perform any dynamic actions.",
