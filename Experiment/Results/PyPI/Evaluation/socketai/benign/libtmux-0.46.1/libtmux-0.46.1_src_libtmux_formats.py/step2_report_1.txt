  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a static configuration module defining constants for tmux formats, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code only defines lists and reads an environment variable for a separator string. No dynamic code execution, no user input, no network activity. The environment variable is used straightforwardly.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0 are appropriate. No security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the code's role in defining format variables, with environment variable access being standard.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely declarative, with no suspicious constructs.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0 are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code reads an environment variable and defines static lists, with no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code's simplicity and static nature make it safe.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, highlights safe environment variable usage and static configuration.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the environment variable is used to set a separator string, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code's purpose is configuration, with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign configuration module. The environment variable is used for customization but does not introduce security risks or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, static, and safe.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe configuration module for tmux formatting, with no issues warranting concern.",
