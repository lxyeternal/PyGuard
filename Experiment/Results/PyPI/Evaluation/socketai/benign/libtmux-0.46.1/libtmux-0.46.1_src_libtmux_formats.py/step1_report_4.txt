  "purpose": "Define format variable names for tmux objects in a Python module, enabling consistent referencing and potential customization via environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('LIBTMUX_TMUX_FORMAT_SEPARATOR')",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads environment variables and defines constant lists.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> constant definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The environment variable is used for configuration but is not processed insecurely. No user input or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility, then imports os to access environment variables. It defines a separator string 'FORMAT_SEPARATOR' that can be customized via an environment variable, with a default value. It then defines multiple lists of format strings corresponding to tmux session, client, window, and pane objects. No untrusted data processing, no command execution, and no dynamic code evaluation are present. The environment variable usage is safe and straightforward. The code mainly serves as configuration constants.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration module defining constants and reading a single environment variable for customization. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code is straightforward and only involves safe environment variable access and constant list definitions.",
