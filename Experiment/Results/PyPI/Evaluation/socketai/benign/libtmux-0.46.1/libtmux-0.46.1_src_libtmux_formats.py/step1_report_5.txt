  "purpose": "Define format variable names for tmux objects for use in a larger Python project, likely related to tmux status or scripting.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get(\"LIBTMUX_TMUX_FORMAT_SEPARATOR\", \"␞\")",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; environment variable used only to set a separator string.",
  "flows": "Environment variable retrieval influences FORMAT_SEPARATOR; no further data flows or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The environment variable is used to customize a separator, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os to access environment variables and defines several lists of format strings related to tmux objects. The only dynamic aspect is reading an environment variable, which is used to set a separator string. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve configuration purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup for format string definitions related to tmux. It safely reads an environment variable for customization without executing untrusted data or performing any malicious actions.",
