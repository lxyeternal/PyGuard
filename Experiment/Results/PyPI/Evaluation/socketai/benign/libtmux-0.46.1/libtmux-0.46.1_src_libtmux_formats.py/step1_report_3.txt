  "purpose": "Define format variables for tmux objects and retrieve environment configuration for separator.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LIBTMUX_TMUX_FORMAT_SEPARATOR' via os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leakage or execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variable is read during module import; no further data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward configuration and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os for environment variable access, defines constants for tmux formatting, and retrieves a separator value from the environment. All variables are static lists or constants with no dynamic or untrusted input processing, code execution, or external network activity. No sensitive data handling, cryptographic operations, or obfuscated code are present. The environment variable usage is standard for configurability and does not pose a security risk by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration module defining format strings for tmux and reading a separator from environment variables. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The design is safe, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
