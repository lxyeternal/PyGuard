  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the reasoning provided, and the scoring assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static configuration module defining constants and lists of format strings for tmux.\n- It reads an environment variable `LIBTMUX_TMUX_FORMAT_SEPARATOR` to customize a separator string.\n- There are no functions, dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity.\n- The code does not process or evaluate untrusted data beyond reading environment variables.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define constants for tmux formats.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, straightforward environment variable access.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is accurate; the code is benign.\n- The score of 0 for malware and security risk is appropriate.\n- The environment variable usage is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define format variables, retrieve environment variable.\n- Analysis: No anomalies, no suspicious constructs.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies that the code is purely configuration.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define format variables, read environment variable.\n- Analysis: No anomalies, no dynamic code execution.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's static nature.\n- The environment variable is used safely.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define constants, read environment variable.\n- Analysis: No untrusted data processing, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward configuration.\n- The environment variable is used in a safe manner.\n- Scores are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define format strings, read environment variable for separator.\n- Analysis: No obfuscation, no malicious code, only configuration.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is accurate.\n- The environment variable is used only for configuration.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code Content:** Static configuration with environment variable for customization.\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risks:** None apparent; the code is safe.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The environment variable usage is standard and does not introduce risk.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My Personal Estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign configuration module, and the reports accurately reflect that.",
