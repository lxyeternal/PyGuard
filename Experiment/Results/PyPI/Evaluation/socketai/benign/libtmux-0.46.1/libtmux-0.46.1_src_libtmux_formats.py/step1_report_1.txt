{
  "purpose": "Define constants and formats for tmux variables in a Python module, likely for configuring or generating tmux status or object formats.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LIBTMUX_TMUX_FORMAT_SEPARATOR' via os.environ.get",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used directly in sensitive operations or external effects",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> stored in FORMAT_SEPARATOR; static format lists remain constant",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs observed. Usage of environment variable is standard; no unusual code flow.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os to read an environment variable for a format separator, which is a typical configuration pattern. It defines several static lists of string constants representing tmux object formats, which appear to be documentation or configuration data. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injection. The environment variable access is straightforward and does not involve processing or eval-like behavior. The code serves as a static configuration/constants module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module that defines constants for tmux formatting. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
