  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines constants for tmux formatting, reads an environment variable for a separator, and contains static lists. No dynamic code execution or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Evaluation:** The environment variable is used straightforwardly; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The code is purely declarative configuration.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0. This aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign configuration code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on environment variable retrieval and static list definitions.\n- **Evaluation:** No anomalies, no dynamic code, no user input processing. The environment variable influences only a separator string.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard configuration.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—environment variable read, static lists, no dynamic code or external effects.\n- **Evaluation:** Usage of environment variable is safe and typical for configuration.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reads environment variable for separator, static list definitions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Evaluation:** Environment variable used for configuration, no processing of untrusted data.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe configuration code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—environment variable influences separator string, static lists for tmux formats.\n- **Evaluation:** No obfuscation, no malicious code, only configuration.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk score:** The code is purely static configuration with minimal environment interaction. No vulnerabilities or security risks are evident. The risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code only reads an environment variable for a separator string and defines static lists of format strings. There are no dynamic code executions, no user inputs processed insecurely, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The environment variable usage is standard and safe.\n\n**Therefore, my estimated scores are:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
