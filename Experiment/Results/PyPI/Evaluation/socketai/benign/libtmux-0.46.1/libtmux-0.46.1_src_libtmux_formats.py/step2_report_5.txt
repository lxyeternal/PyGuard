  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency, identify any discrepancies, and assess the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines constants and lists for tmux object formats, reads an environment variable for a separator, and appears benign.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The environment variable is used straightforwardly for configuration.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly rated as safe, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; defines format variables, reads an environment variable for separator, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious intent detected. Usage of environment variable is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly rated as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—defines format constants, reads environment variable for separator, no dynamic code or external effects.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Properly rated as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with straightforward environment variable access and static lists.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity or code.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, fitting the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slight variation in environment variable default value (Unicode separator), but still safe.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration data with environment variable customization.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Environment variable usage:** Standard and safe, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Additional note:** Given the absence of any dynamic code execution, external network activity, or handling of untrusted user input, there's no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0      |\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment; the code is purely static configuration with safe environment variable usage.",
