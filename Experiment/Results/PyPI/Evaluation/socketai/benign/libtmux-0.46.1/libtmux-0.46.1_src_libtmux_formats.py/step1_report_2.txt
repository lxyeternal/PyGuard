  "flows": "Environment variable 'LIBTMUX_TMUX_FORMAT_SEPARATOR' influences the value of FORMAT_SEPARATOR.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward configuration with no dynamic code execution or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variables to set a separator string used in tmux formatting. It defines multiple lists of format strings for sessions, clients, windows, and panes. There are no functions, no data processing, no user inputs, or external commands executed. The environment variable is accessed in a standard way without any validation or sanitization, but since it is used as a separator string, this is not inherently suspicious. The code is purely declarative configuration data, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a harmless configuration module defining format variables for tmux. It reads an environment variable to customize a separator string, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
