  "purpose": "Utility functions for version parsing, comparison, and exception reraising in Python.",
  "sources": "Version strings, exception objects, standard library modules (re, sys, functools, types).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "Input version strings are parsed and compared internally; exception reraising manipulates traceback objects but is unused.",
  "anomalies": "The 'reraise' function is defined but not called; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utilities for legacy version handling and exception management. No network, file, or environment manipulation occurs. The 'reraise' function, while unused, is implemented safely. Regex and string operations are typical for version parsing. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with known practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for version comparison and exception handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified; the slight security risk score (around 0.2) accounts for potential misuse of traceback manipulation but is not indicative of actual malicious intent.",
