  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for hal9 API functions to create, run, deploy, and describe AI projects.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments and options, passed directly to external API functions.",
  "sinks": "External API functions (`api_create`, `api_run`, `api_deploy`, etc.) which may process or execute data.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> CLI commands/options -> API function calls -> External API processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that delegates user commands and parameters directly to external API functions without internal processing or code execution. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of the external hal9 API modules, which are outside the scope of this review. The code's structure and behavior are standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws. Scores assigned in previous reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2) are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity and external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious elements. Its security posture depends on the external API modules' trustworthiness, but within this code snippet, no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.",
