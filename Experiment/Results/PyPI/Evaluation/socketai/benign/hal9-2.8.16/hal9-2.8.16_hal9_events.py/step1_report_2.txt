  "purpose": "The code manages event data by storing event names and details in a local JSON file within a hidden directory.",
  "sources": "Reading existing JSON data from '.storage/.events' file.",
  "sinks": "Writing updated JSON data back to '.storage/.events' file.",
  "flows": "Reads from the '.storage/.events' file, appends new event data, then writes back to the same file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The directory and file are managed locally without external communication.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a hidden directory '.storage' if it does not exist, then reads from or creates a JSON file '.storage/.events'. It loads existing event data, appends a new event with provided name and details, and writes the updated list back to disk. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious file operations are present. The code appears to perform simple local storage of event logs without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for local event logging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
