  "purpose": "Application launcher that dynamically invokes runtime functions based on user input parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the source file path, source filename, runtime type, and optional parameters; checks file existence.",
  "sinks": "Calls external runtime functions with source path, port, and params; no direct data leaks or execution of untrusted data within this code.",
  "flows": "Source parameters -> file existence check -> runtime function invocation with params -> execution.",
  "anomalies": "The 'params' argument is passed as a string without validation or parsing, which could be risky if runtime functions interpret it insecurely.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dispatcher that validates file existence and calls external runtime functions based on user input. It does not execute untrusted data directly and contains no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The main concern is the unvalidated 'params' being passed to external modules, which could lead to vulnerabilities if those modules process 'params' insecurely. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is low (around 0.2-0.4), reflecting potential external risks but no inherent malicious behavior within this code. The scores are consistent with the code's benign structure and the reports' assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign application launcher with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that external runtime functions handle 'params' securely. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2-0.4). No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis.",
