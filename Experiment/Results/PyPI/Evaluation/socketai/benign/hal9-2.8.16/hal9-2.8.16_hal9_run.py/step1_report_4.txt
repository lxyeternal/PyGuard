  "purpose": "Provides a function to run various runtime applications based on user-specified parameters and a description of available runtimes.",
  "sources": "Path input (path argument), source filename (source argument), runtime type (type argument), optional params (params argument).",
  "sinks": "The runtime functions called (e.g., run_python, run_image, etc.) which could execute arbitrary code or processes depending on implementation.",
  "flows": "Path and source parameters are used to locate and execute external scripts/files through dynamic function calls, which may invoke code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit hardcoded credentials or malicious code; however, dynamic invocation of runtime functions based on user input could lead to code execution if the called functions are malicious or insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific runtime handlers and maintains a mapping for runtime types. The 'run' function constructs a file path and conditionally executes a runtime handler based on user input. If the source file does not exist, it prints a failure message. The runtime handlers are invoked with the source path, port, and params. There is a potential risk if these handlers or the 'params' input are malicious or if the runtime functions themselves execute untrusted code. The 'describe_runtimes' function simply lists available runtime types, which is not suspicious. The code does not contain obfuscated elements, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration code itself but relies on external runtime functions that could be exploited if compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself appears to be a generic application runner dispatcher. It dynamically calls external runtime functions based on user input, which could be a vector for malicious behavior if the called functions are insecure or malicious. The code is otherwise straightforward and does not contain obvious malicious intent or obfuscation. However, the overall security depends on the implementation of the runtime functions, which are external to this code.",
