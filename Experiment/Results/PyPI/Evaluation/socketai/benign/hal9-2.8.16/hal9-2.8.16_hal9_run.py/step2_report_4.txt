  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Code Behavior and Security Implications:**\n\n- The code functions as a dispatcher, selecting and invoking runtime functions based on user input parameters.\n- It performs minimal validation: only checks if the source file exists before invoking the runtime.\n- The 'params' argument is a string, likely intended to be JSON, but it is passed directly to runtime functions without parsing or sanitization. This could be a vector for injection if runtime functions interpret it insecurely.\n- The code does not execute untrusted data directly; it relies on external runtime functions, which are imported modules. The security of the overall system depends heavily on these external modules.\n\n**2. Presence of Malicious Behavior or Backdoors:**\n\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors within this code fragment.\n- The code is straightforward and standard for a runtime launcher.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic are present.\n\n**3. Potential Risks:**\n\n- The main concern is the passing of unvalidated 'params' to external runtime functions. If these functions process 'params' insecurely, it could lead to vulnerabilities.\n- The dynamic invocation based on user input could be exploited if the runtime functions are malicious or compromised.\n\n**4. Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as zero, which aligns with the code's transparency.\n- The code does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n**5. Risk Scores:**\n\n- The reports assign security risk scores mostly around 0.2 to 0.4, citing the handling of 'params' and reliance on external modules.\n- Given the minimal validation and the potential for external runtime functions to be insecure, a moderate risk score (~0.3) seems appropriate.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no report overstates or understates the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** Considering the potential for insecure handling of 'params' and reliance on external modules, I would assign a **risk score of approximately 0.3**. This reflects a moderate security concern mainly due to external dependencies and unvalidated input passing.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard application launcher with no embedded malicious behavior.\n- The main security concern is the handling of 'params' without validation, which could be exploited if runtime functions are insecure.\n- The overall malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The risk score should be around **0.3**, acknowledging the dependency on external code and input handling.\n\n**Final recommendations:** Ensure that runtime functions are secure and validate or sanitize 'params' before passing them to external modules.",
