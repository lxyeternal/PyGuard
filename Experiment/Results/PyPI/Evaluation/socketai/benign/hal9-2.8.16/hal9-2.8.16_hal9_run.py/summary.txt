  "conclusion": "The code is a benign application launcher with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that external runtime functions handle 'params' securely. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2-0.4). No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis."
