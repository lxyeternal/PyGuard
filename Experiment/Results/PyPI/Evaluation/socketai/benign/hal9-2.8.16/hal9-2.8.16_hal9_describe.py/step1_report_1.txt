{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes a given file or directory to identify if it contains specific web framework indicators, such as FastAPI, Flask, Shiny, or Streamlit, by inspecting file contents.",
  "sources": "Reading the specified file(s) or directory listing to locate files and their contents.",
  "sinks": "File opening and reading operations, which could potentially be misused if combined with untrusted input to access sensitive files, though no such malicious pattern is present here.",
  "flows": "Directory or file path input -> Listing or file access -> Reading file contents -> Pattern matching in contents to identify framework type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code performs straightforward file inspection based on predefined criteria.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a set of criteria to identify specific web frameworks based on file names and content patterns. It checks whether the input is a file or directory, then reads relevant files to look for keywords indicating frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, Shiny, or Streamlit. The file reading uses a safe open call with specified encoding, and the pattern matching is simple substring search. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The code does not execute untrusted code, nor does it contain any backdoors or hidden functionalities. Overall, it is a benign utility for framework detection with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic, non-malicious file inspection for framework detection without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It is a safe utility script with no security concerns.",
