{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze a given file or directory to identify the type of web framework (FastAPI, Shiny, Streamlit) based on specific files and content patterns.",
  "sources": "File system access via os.path.isfile, os.path.isdir, os.listdir, and reading file contents with open().",
  "sinks": "Reading files from disk; no data output, network transmission, or external system interaction detected.",
  "flows": "File and directory path resolution → File content reading → Pattern matching in file contents to determine framework type.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward file checks and content searches.",
  "analysis": "The script performs initial checks for file or directory existence, then reads specific files (e.g., app.py, main.py, app.R) to identify framework types by searching for particular import statements or library calls. There is no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input beyond reading files from the local filesystem. The logic is simple and static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a static analyzer to identify framework types based on file content. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility script with no indications of security threats.",
