{
  "purpose": "Detects the type of web framework (FastAPI, Flask, Shiny, Streamlit) based on specific filenames and content patterns within files or directories.",
  "sources": "Reads filenames in directories or files directly, and reads file contents to match specific import or library statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only reads local files and directories without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Checks for presence of specific filenames; if found, reads file contents to match framework indicators; no external data flow or execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward pattern matching with safe file operations; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filesystem checks for specific filenames and reads their contents to identify frameworks. It uses safe open/read operations and simple substring matching. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, and the security posture is benign. The only minor concern is the security risk score in one report, which can be lowered to zero, as the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for framework detection with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The slight security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are appropriate.",
