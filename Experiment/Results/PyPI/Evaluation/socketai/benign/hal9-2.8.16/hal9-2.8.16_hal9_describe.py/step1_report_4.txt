{
  "purpose": "This code inspects files within a given directory or file path to identify specific web framework types based on the presence of certain filenames and content patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads filenames from directory listings and file contents by opening files specified within the target path or directory.",
  "targets": "Potentially untrusted file contents that are read from the filesystem, which could be malicious or manipulated, but the code itself does not write or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads directory contents -> Opens specific files based on criteria -> Reads file contents to match known framework signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward file inspection without executing or transmitting data.",
  "analysis": "The script checks whether a provided path is a file or directory. If it's a file, it considers that single file; if a directory, it lists all files. It then searches for specific filenames and content patterns associated with known web frameworks (FastAPI, Shiny, Streamlit). The code reads files only to identify framework types; it does not execute or modify data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration. Its behavior is benign and intended for environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detector that classifies the type of web framework based on file presence and content. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
