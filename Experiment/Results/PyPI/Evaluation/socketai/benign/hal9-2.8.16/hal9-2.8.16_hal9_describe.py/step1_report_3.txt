{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to identify the type of a project directory or file based on the presence of specific files and content patterns associated with FastAPI, Shiny, or Streamlit applications.",
  "sources": "Reads file names via os.listdir or os.path.basename, and reads file contents via open().",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, specifically open() with read mode; no other sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads file names from the filesystem, then reads content from specific files to detect keywords indicating project type.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities observed. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or malicious commands. It relies solely on filesystem operations and string matching.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward filesystem checks: it reads directory or file names, then opens specific files to look for known framework import statements. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. It appears to be a benign project identification utility. No indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple project type detector based on filesystem content. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code, malware, or security risks. It operates solely with safe file operations and pattern matching.",
