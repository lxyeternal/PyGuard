The primary security consideration is ensuring that external runtime functions handle 'params' securely. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2-0.4). No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis."

The primary security concern is trusting external deployment functions, which are outside this code snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low risk score (~0.2). No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation within this code."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility-focused with significant security risks stemming from unvalidated pickle deserialization, which could lead to remote code execution if exploited. No active malware or malicious payloads are present, but the practices pose high potential for abuse. The current scores of malware=0 to 0.25 and risk=0.2 to 0.75 are justified, with higher scores in report 5 reflecting the deserialization vulnerability. Overall, the code should be used cautiously, and safer serialization methods or validation should be implemented."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for framework detection with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The slight security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are appropriate."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the deserialization of untrusted JSON arguments without validation, which could lead to injection if inputs are malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 to reflect the deserialization risk. Implementing input validation or sandboxing would mitigate this concern."
