  "purpose": "The code provides a deployment function that invokes specific deployment targets based on user parameters.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as target, path, url, name, typename, data, access, main, title, description.",
  "sinks": "The deployment target functions (deploy_docker, deploy_hal9) which are invoked with user data; potential for these functions to handle untrusted data improperly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> target selection -> target function call with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The use of an exception for unsupported targets is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific deployment functions and maps them to target strings. It defines a deploy function accepting multiple parameters, most of which are passed directly to the target functions without validation or sanitization. The function performs a simple target check and calls the associated deployment function with user inputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity within this code snippet. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper for deployment operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deployment handler that delegates tasks based on input parameters. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior is evident. It relies on external deployment functions, which are not included here; thus, their security cannot be assessed. Overall, the code appears benign.",
