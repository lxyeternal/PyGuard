  "purpose": "A deployment dispatcher that delegates deployment tasks to external functions based on user input.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed directly to external deployment functions (`deploy_docker`, `deploy_hal9`).",
  "sinks": "External functions that could perform malicious actions if untrusted or malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from the `deploy()` function into the external deployment functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code present; no validation or sanitization of inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dispatcher that imports two deployment functions and calls them based on the target parameter. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The security implications depend on the external functions, which are not provided. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are evident. The parameters are passed directly without validation, which could be risky if external functions are malicious or insecure. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting reliance on external functions without validation. The code itself appears benign, with the main concern being trust in external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign deployment dispatcher with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is trusting external deployment functions, which are outside this code snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low risk score (~0.2). No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation within this code.",
