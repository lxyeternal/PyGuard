  "conclusion": "The code is a benign deployment dispatcher with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is trusting external deployment functions, which are outside this code snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low risk score (~0.2). No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation within this code."
