  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the deserialization of untrusted JSON arguments without validation, which could lead to injection if inputs are malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 to reflect the deserialization risk. Implementing input validation or sandboxing would mitigate this concern."
