{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract code blocks from Markdown text, either by specific language or all code blocks with optional filename annotations.",
  "sources": "Reads Markdown input passed to the extract, extract_one, and extract_all functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns extracted code as strings, concatenated where applicable. No direct sinks for untrusted data that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input Markdown -> regex pattern matching -> extraction of code blocks -> returning code strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of regex appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex to find code blocks in Markdown content, supporting both specific language extraction and all code blocks with optional filename tags. Functions handle input parameters safely without executing code or handling sensitive data. No evidence of malicious behaviors like network activity, system manipulation, or data theft. The code's logic is straightforward and typical for documentation parsing utilities. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for extracting code snippets from Markdown documents. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
