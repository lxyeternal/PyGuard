  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Functions to extract code blocks from markdown text using regex.\n- `extract_one`: extracts code for a specific language.\n- `extract_all`: extracts all code blocks, with optional filename annotations.\n- `extract`: delegates to one of the above based on parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All correctly identify the code as a markdown code block extractor.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Consistently note that there are no external or dangerous data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** All correctly observe that regex is used for parsing, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** All agree that the code is benign, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They do not overstate security concerns and correctly identify the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - `malware`: 0 in all reports — appropriate.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 — appropriate.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  No evidence supports increasing the risk score; the code is a utility for parsing markdown, with no malicious or risky features.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the comprehensive analysis and the absence of any suspicious patterns, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign markdown parser utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No changes needed. The code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.",
