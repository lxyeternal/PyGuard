{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract code blocks from markdown text, either by specific language or all code blocks with optional filename annotations.",
  "sources": "Reads markdown input strings and uses regex patterns to find code blocks and annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points that lead to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input markdown → regex extraction → concatenation of code blocks → output; no external data flow or malicious transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. The regex patterns are straightforward and intended for extraction purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to parse markdown text and extract code blocks based on language, filename, or all blocks. Uses regex with raw strings and DOTALL flag to match multi-line code snippets. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws are detected. The code appears purely for data extraction with clear, intended functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard markdown parser for extracting code blocks. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward in purpose.",
