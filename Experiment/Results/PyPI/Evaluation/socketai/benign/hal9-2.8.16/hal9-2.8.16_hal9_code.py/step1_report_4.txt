{
  "purpose": "The code extracts code blocks from markdown text based on specified programming language or other criteria.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'markdown' which contains markdown-formatted text.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external sources, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input markdown -> regex pattern matching -> extraction of code blocks -> output concatenated code strings or dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code uses regex patterns for parsing, which is standard for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to extract code blocks from markdown text based on language or filename attributes. It uses regex patterns with raw strings and re.DOTALL flag to find code segments. No external data is fetched, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious pattern matching. The functions are straightforward, primarily performing text extraction. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no attempts to exfiltrate data, and no suspicious network activity. The functions do not handle or store sensitive data maliciously. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for markdown parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard markdown code block parser with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward text processing with regex, and there are no anomalous or malicious behaviors detected.",
