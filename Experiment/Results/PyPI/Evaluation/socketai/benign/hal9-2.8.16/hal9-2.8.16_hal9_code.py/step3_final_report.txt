  "purpose": "Functions to extract code blocks from markdown text, either for a specific language or all code blocks with optional filename annotations.",
  "sources": "Reads markdown text, uses regex patterns to identify code blocks with optional language and filename annotations.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; internal string processing only.",
  "flows": "Regex pattern matches source code blocks; results are concatenated or stored in dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard regex patterns to parse markdown code blocks, handling optional language and filename annotations. It performs string concatenation and dictionary storage without executing code or performing network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The regex patterns are somewhat strict but appropriate for typical markdown formatting. The functions are straightforward and serve as utility parsers. The code's purpose is benign, with no external data handling or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward markdown code block extractor with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores appropriately set to 0. The overall assessment aligns with the code's functionality.",
