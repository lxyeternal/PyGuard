{
  "purpose": "The code extracts code blocks from markdown text, either for a specific language or all code blocks with optional filename annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'markdown' string parameter in functions extract_one, extract_all, and extract.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data to perform dangerous actions; no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'markdown' into regex patterns, then extracted code is returned or stored in dictionaries; no external or sensitive data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; regex patterns are standard, and code appears solely to parse markdown content without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The functions use regex to identify code blocks within markdown, supporting optional language and filename tags. No dynamic code execution, network access, or system modifications are present. The code performs straightforward parsing without manipulating or exposing sensitive data. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard markdown code block extractor with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to parse and return code snippets from markdown text.",
