  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility-focused with significant security risks stemming from unvalidated pickle deserialization, which could lead to remote code execution if exploited. No active malware or malicious payloads are present, but the practices pose high potential for abuse. The current scores of malware=0 to 0.25 and risk=0.2 to 0.75 are justified, with higher scores in report 5 reflecting the deserialization vulnerability. Overall, the code should be used cautiously, and safer serialization methods or validation should be implemented."
