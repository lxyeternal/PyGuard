{
  "purpose": "The code checks if a given prompt is a URL, and if so, downloads the content at the URL, processes it with the 'textract' library to extract text, and returns the extracted text. Otherwise, it returns the prompt unchanged.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'prompt' parameter, checks its format, and potentially reads data from a URL via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to a temporary file, reads data from a URL, and uses 'textract.process' which processes the downloaded file content.",
  "flows": "Input 'prompt' -> URL validation -> URL content download -> temporary file storage -> 'textract.process' extraction -> return extracted text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The use of 'textract' is conditional and it is imported dynamically. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present. Exception handling is generic, silently returning the original prompt.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL validation and attempts to download and process content at that URL using 'textract' if available. It manages temporary files carefully and handles exceptions silently, which could mask issues but does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. It appears to be a utility for extracting text from URLs or returning input as-is. The use of 'textract' is conditional and safe assuming proper library use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for extracting text from URLs with no apparent malicious intent or malicious behavior. It includes safe practices like temporary file handling and exception catching. No security risks are evident based on this code fragment.",
