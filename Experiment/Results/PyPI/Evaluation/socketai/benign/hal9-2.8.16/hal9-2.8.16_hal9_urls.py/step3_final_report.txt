{
  "purpose": "Fetches content from a URL if input is a URL, optionally processes it with textract to extract text, and returns the result or original prompt.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen for URL content, importlib.util.find_spec for optional textract import, os.path.splitext for file extension, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile for temporary file creation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential for resource leaks if exceptions occur before cleanup, and processing untrusted URL content without validation.",
  "flows": "Input prompt checked if URL -> URL content fetched -> saved to temp file -> textract processes file -> cleaned up -> returns text; else returns prompt.",
  "anomalies": "Uses tempfile with delete=False without guaranteed cleanup on exceptions, broad exception handling masks errors, minimal URL validation, dynamic import of textract.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for URL content retrieval and optional text extraction. It dynamically imports textract, handles files via temporary storage, and manages exceptions broadly. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The main concerns are resource management (temp files) and minimal URL validation, which could be exploited but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior is found. Minor improvements could include better temp file cleanup and URL validation, but these are best practices rather than security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing URL content fetching and text extraction with no malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Overall, the code is safe, with minor resource management concerns that do not constitute security threats.",
