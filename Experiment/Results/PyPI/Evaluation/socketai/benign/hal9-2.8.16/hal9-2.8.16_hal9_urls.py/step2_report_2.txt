  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scoring.\n\n**1. Report 1**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code fetches URL content, saves it temporarily, and processes it with textract if available. No malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes that tempfile is created with `delete=False`, which could leave residual files if exceptions occur. This is a minor concern but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification for scores:** No malware, low security risk due to potential leftover files, which is acceptable.  \n- **Overall:** The report is accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n**2. Report 2**  \n- **Issue presence:** Similar functionality, no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report mentions that 'textract' is loaded dynamically, which is benign but could be used to evade static detection. No other issues.  \n- **Scores:** All zero malware, low security risk.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just content fetching and processing.  \n- **Overall:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**3. Report 3**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report emphasizes safe practices and the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware, low security risk.  \n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**4. Report 4**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, benign URL fetch and text extraction.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report notes exception handling could mask errors but isn't malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Zero malware, security risk=0.2, which is consistent with the potential for mishandling untrusted URLs.  \n- **Overall:** Reasonable.\n\n**5. Report 5**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same benign functionality.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report points out that URL validation is minimal (only scheme and netloc), which could be insufficient for security, but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, consistent with potential risks of unvalidated URLs but no malicious intent.  \n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code behavior:** All reports agree the code is a URL fetch and text extraction utility with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all, correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.2) due to potential mishandling of untrusted URLs or leftover temp files, but not a sign of malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, considering potential resource leaks and minimal URL validation.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor concerns about temporary file cleanup and URL validation, but nothing severe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and their scores are justified. The code appears safe, with only minor resource management concerns.",
