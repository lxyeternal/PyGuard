  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported details, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same core functionality: checking if 'prompt' is a URL, fetching content if so, optionally processing with 'textract', and returning either the extracted text or the original prompt.\n- The code uses dynamic import of 'textract', temporary files with delete=False, broad exception handling, and network requests via urllib.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or explicit malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The primary concern is potential misuse with malicious URLs or files, but nothing in the code indicates malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code appears correct for its purpose. No evident bugs or vulnerabilities are explicitly described.  \n  **Note:** The use of `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)` can leave files on disk if exceptions occur before cleanup, but this is a minor resource management concern, not malicious.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reports:**  \n  The reports consistently mention broad exception handling, dynamic import, and lack of URL validation beyond scheme and netloc. They do not identify actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors, which aligns with the code.\n\n- **Scores for malware and security risk:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0.2`. Given the benign nature, these seem reasonable. The `securityRisk` score reflects some potential concern over processing untrusted content, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Claim:** No malicious behavior, safe handling, minor concern about leftover files if exceptions occur.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Claim:** Similar benign analysis, mentions optional dependency management, no malicious intent.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Claim:** Same as above, emphasizes safe practices, no malicious activity.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Claim:** Reiterates benign utility, no malicious behavior, safe practices.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Claim:** Same overall assessment, no malicious intent, standard practices.  \n- **Score:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code being straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across reports is reasonable, reflecting a minor concern about processing untrusted external content, but no significant security flaw.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — potential for misuse with malicious URLs, but not an inherent vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. The code appears benign, with minor concerns related to handling untrusted external content and temporary files.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nWhile the code is generally safe, it could be improved by validating URL content (e.g., size, content type) and ensuring temporary files are cleaned up even in exceptions. However, these are best practices rather than security issues.\n\n**Overall security assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2",
