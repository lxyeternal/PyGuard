{
  "purpose": "The code aims to retrieve and process content from URLs or return the input prompt as-is if not a URL, with optional text extraction using the 'textract' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'prompt' parameter and from URLs via 'urllib.request.urlopen'. It also loads the 'textract' library dynamically if available.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage through URL content being returned. Use of 'textract' could process untrusted files if provided via URL. No direct data exfiltration or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'prompt' is checked if URL; if so, data is fetched via URL, saved temporarily, then processed with 'textract', and finally returned. If not URL, 'prompt' is returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically importing 'textract' only if present; no explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No suspicious URL handling beyond standard fetch. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks whether 'prompt' is a URL. If true, it attempts to download the content to a temporary file, then processes it with 'textract' to extract text. It handles exceptions gracefully, returning the original prompt if errors occur. No indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The use of 'textract' depends on its presence and is safe if used as intended. The code does not manipulate or store data maliciously, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard URL content fetch and text extraction utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It operates within normal bounds of functionality for content retrieval and processing.",
