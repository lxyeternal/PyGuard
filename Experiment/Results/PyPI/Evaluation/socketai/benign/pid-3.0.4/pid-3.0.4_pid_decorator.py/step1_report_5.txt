  "sources": "Function parameters and the imported PidFile module.",
  "sinks": "Usage of PidFile context manager, which may interact with the filesystem or process control.",
  "flows": "Decorator invocation -> Wrapper creation -> Decorated function call -> PidFile context manager execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code correctly checks for proper decorator usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that ensures a PID file is handled during the execution of a wrapped function. It validates the decorator usage to prevent incorrect application. The core operation involves using a PidFile context manager, which likely manages PID files on the filesystem. No untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no malicious logic are present. The imported PidFile's implementation is not shown, but the usage appears standard for process control. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Overall, this code is a typical pattern for managing PID files, with no suspicious activities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard PID file management decorator without malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for process management in Python applications.",
