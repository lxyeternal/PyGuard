  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project.\n- No reports detect any malicious activity, suspicious patterns, or security risks.\n- The code reads version info from a source file, which is a common and safe practice.\n- The use of codecs.open and regex for version extraction are standard and not suspicious.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration points are identified.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, consistent with their findings.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The code does not execute untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network operations.\n- The only dynamic aspect is reading the version string, which is a typical pattern.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The security risk scores are minimal (0.0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Score justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the potential for reading version info, but this is standard and not risky.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard practice, minimal risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and follows best practices for package setup. No further security concerns are evident.",
