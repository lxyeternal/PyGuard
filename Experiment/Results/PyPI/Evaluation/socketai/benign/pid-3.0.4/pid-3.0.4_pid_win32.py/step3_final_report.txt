  "purpose": "Manage PID files on Windows systems, ensuring process exclusivity and proper file locking using platform-specific libraries.",
  "sources": "Reading PID files, checking process existence with psutil, locking files with msvcrt",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, process existence checks, file locking",
  "flows": "Read PID file -> check process existence -> lock file to prevent concurrent access",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; platform-specific error handling is appropriate",
  "analysis": "The code implements Windows-specific PID file management using standard libraries. It performs process checks and file locking without any malicious or suspicious behavior. Error handling aligns with platform limitations. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's straightforward, legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented Windows PID file handler with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the current scores are justified.",
