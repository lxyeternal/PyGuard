{
  "purpose": "This code implements a recursive data acquisition plan using the Bluesky framework, simulating hardware interactions and storing data in a database, with controlled recursion via a global counter.",
  "sources": "Hardware simulation objects (`hw.motor1`, `hw.det1`), plan parameters (`npts`), and dynamically generated run keys (`run_key_{n_calls}`)",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in the database (`db.insert`); no external data leaks or network activity are present",
  "flows": "Hardware data flows into the plan, which generates run keys and stores data; recursive calls modify parameters and generate new runs",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variables (`n_calls`) for recursion control; dynamic run key generation is benign; no suspicious code patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Bluesky recursive experiment setup with simulated hardware, decorators for run management, and controlled recursion. No external inputs, secrets, or network activity are involved. The use of global variables for recursion control is a potential safety concern but not malicious. The dynamic run key generation and data storage are typical. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The recursive pattern and decorators are used appropriately, and the code is transparent and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific workflow with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It poses a very low security risk, with no malware or obfuscation. The use of global variables for recursion control is noted but not dangerous in this context.",
