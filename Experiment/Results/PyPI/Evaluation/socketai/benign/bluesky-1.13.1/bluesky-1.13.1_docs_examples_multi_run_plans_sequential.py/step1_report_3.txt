{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate consecutive execution of single-run plans in a bluesky data acquisition setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from databroker, ophyd.sim, and bluesky modules; use of hardware simulation objects; function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data directly; data is stored in a database.",
  "flows": "Hardware data from ophyd.sim, plans generate data, data is inserted into the database.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a bluesky RunEngine, connects it to a database and callbacks, and defines a simple plan to run sequential scans. It uses standard library functions and established patterns for data acquisition. No external or untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard example of executing sequential plans within a scientific data acquisition framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
