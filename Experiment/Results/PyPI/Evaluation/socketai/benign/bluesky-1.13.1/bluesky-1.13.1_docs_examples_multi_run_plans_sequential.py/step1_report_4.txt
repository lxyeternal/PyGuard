{
  "purpose": "To perform sequential scans using the bluesky framework with simulated hardware and store results in a database.",
  "sources": "Importing data from databroker, ophyd.sim, and bluesky; accessing simulated hardware hw; reading plan parameters from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data insertion into the database (db.insert); plan execution flow.",
  "flows": "Hardware data read -> plan execution (scan and rel_scan) -> data storage in database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns detected. Usage of simulated hardware is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known scientific data acquisition libraries, sets up a simulated hardware environment, initializes a RunEngine, subscribes a database and a callback, and defines a plan for sequential execution of scans. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the data flows are typical for data acquisition workflows. No external network connections, credential handling, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup for performing automated scans with simulated hardware, intended for testing or demonstration purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
