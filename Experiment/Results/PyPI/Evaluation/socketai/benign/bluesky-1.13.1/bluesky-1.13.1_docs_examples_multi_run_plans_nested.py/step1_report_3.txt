  "purpose": "This code sets up a data acquisition and control plan using Bluesky, Ophyd, and DataBroker for scientific experiments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for libraries, creation of hardware objects (hw), and function parameters (npts).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found that send data or execute untrusted commands externally; data is stored locally in a database.",
  "flows": "Hardware object properties (e.g., hw.motor1) are used as sources; control flow involves yielding commands to hardware and data collection functions; no untrusted input flows into critical sections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Code appears standard for experimental control and data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific control libraries, initializes hardware simulation objects, and defines nested plans for data acquisition. Data is stored into a named local database. The functions include typical plan steps: declare streams, move hardware, trigger and read. No untrusted data inputs, external network connections, or suspicious code behavior observed. The structure aligns with standard use of the libraries and no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific control script for data acquisition with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate setup for experimental runs.",
