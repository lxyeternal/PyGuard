{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate motor scan patterns such as spirals, squares, Fermat spirals, and grid scans, primarily for controlling experimental hardware in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (e.g., motor objects, start/end positions, pattern parameters), data imported from external libraries (e.g., numpy, cycler, toolz/cytools).",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to files, sends data over networks, or executes external commands; it primarily generates cycler objects for motor control trajectories.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate lists of positions, which are then wrapped into cycler objects; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for pattern generation; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. External library imports are typical and fallback mechanisms are straightforward. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple pattern generation functions for motor control, including spiral, square, Fermat spiral, and grid patterns, with support for complex trajectories such as snake-like and pattern classification. It uses external libraries such as numpy, cycler, and toolz/cytools for data manipulation and pattern creation. No external data is read from insecure sources, no network connections are established, and no file I/O operations are present that could be malicious. All functions are standard pattern generators with clear, documented parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of pattern generation functions intended for use in hardware control sequences. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be safe, well-structured, and intended solely for systematic trajectory planning.",
