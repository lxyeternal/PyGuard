{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to generate movement trajectories (spiral, square, Fermat spiral, grid scans) for motors or similar devices, facilitating scanning patterns in experimental setups.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries (collections, functools, operator, enum, numpy), third-party modules (cycler, cytools or toolz), and internal utilities (.utils). The code reads input parameters for scan configurations and optional imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present. Data is processed internally and used solely for cycler object creation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute coordinate points, which are then fed into cycler objects for iteration. No untrusted data flows into external systems or insecure functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code appears to be well-structured, intended for pattern generation in motion control.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions to generate scanning trajectories, using mathematical computations and pattern logic. It utilizes standard mathematical operations, numpy for calculations, and external libraries for pattern cycling. There is no code executing external commands, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The imports are consistent with the purpose, and no obfuscated or suspicious language features are present. Functions like 'classify_outer_product_args_pattern' perform argument validation but contain no malicious logic. The code appears purely functional, focused on geometric trajectory calculations, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and intended for generating various scanning patterns for motors or actuators. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The only potential concern could be misuse of trajectory functions if inputs are not validated externally, but this does not constitute malicious code. Overall, the code is safe and free from malware or security threats.",
