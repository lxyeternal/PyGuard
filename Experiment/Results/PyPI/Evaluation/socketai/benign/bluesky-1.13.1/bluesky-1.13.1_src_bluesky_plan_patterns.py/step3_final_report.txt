  "purpose": "Pattern generation functions for motor control trajectories, including spiral, square, Fermat spiral, and mesh patterns, used in experimental setups.",
  "sources": "Standard libraries (collections, functools, operator, numpy, enum), external pattern libraries (cytools/toolz), and internal utils.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data leaks, network communication, or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Mathematical calculations generate coordinate points, which are passed into cycler objects for motor control sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. Use of fallback for cytools is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of geometric pattern functions (spiral, square, Fermat, mesh) for motor trajectory planning. All functions perform straightforward calculations, with no external data handling or system modifications. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and includes argument validation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, transparent utility module for generating motor control patterns. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The supply chain security risk is minimal.",
