  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a static Sphinx configuration file that makes an HTTP GET request to fetch version switcher JSON. The request is used solely to determine if the switcher exists. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, as the only network activity is a benign GET request during build.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign, and the external request is a common pattern for dynamic documentation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the external URL fetch during build. The request is used for configuration, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low; the only concern is the external request, which is standard.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity, just a runtime check for version switching.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The script fetches a JSON from an external URL to configure version switching. No malicious behavior or suspicious code detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minor risk due to external request, but it's standard practice.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the external request is typical, and no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—external GET request for configuration, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; the code is a benign configuration script.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** External request to check version switcher URL, used only for read-only verification.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the only external activity is a GET request to a version switcher URL during build time.\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low; the external request is read-only, used for configuration, and does not process untrusted user input or perform harmful actions.\n- **Reasonableness of Scores:** All scores are consistent with the analysis. Malware scores are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0 for all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep low (around 0.1–0.2), as the only concern is external requests, which are standard in such configuration scripts.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with a single external HTTP GET request used for version switcher configuration. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
