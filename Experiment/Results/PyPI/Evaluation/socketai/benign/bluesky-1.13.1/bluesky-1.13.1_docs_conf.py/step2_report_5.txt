  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the context:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static configuration for Sphinx documentation, with a single external HTTP GET request to fetch a version switcher JSON. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are identified. The request is used solely for configuration purposes during build time.\n\n- **Assessment:** The request to `https://blueskyproject.io/{github_repo}/switcher.json` is typical for dynamic documentation features. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low). These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code appears safe and typical for such configuration scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the external request to fetch JSON for version switching. The code's primary dynamic aspect is this HTTP request, which is used for configuration validation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The external request could be a minor security concern if the URL or network is compromised, but in isolation, it’s a standard pattern. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are observed.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are appropriate; the slightly higher risk accounts for the external request.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with standard practices. The external request is a potential attack surface but is common in such contexts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches JSON data from an external URL during build, used for theme configuration. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is identified.\n\n- **Assessment:** The external GET request is typical for dynamic documentation features. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent; the code is benign with a minor security consideration due to external requests.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the external request for switcher JSON, used for theme configuration. No malicious behavior or data exfiltration is detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The external request is a normal part of dynamic documentation setups. No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches a JSON file from a URL to verify its accessibility, used for version switching. No signs of malicious activity or code injection.\n\n- **Assessment:** The external request is read-only and limited to a version check, typical for such scripts.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the external requests are benign, used for configuration, and do not involve any malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is correct. Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the minor security concern of external HTTP requests during build time.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation in the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minor concern due to external requests, but standard in such configuration scripts.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (a cautious but justified middle ground considering external network requests during build)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script with external requests used for dynamic features. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
