  "purpose": "Configure OpenTelemetry tracing and execute a bluesky plan moving a simulated motor to position 5.",
  "sources": "Importing tracing modules, setting up resource attributes, defining the plan, and executing the plan via RunEngine.",
  "sinks": "ConsoleSpanExporter outputs trace data locally; no external data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Tracing setup sources data to the span processor, which outputs to console; plan execution triggers trace spans.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes telemetry resources, sets up a tracer provider with console export, defines a simple plan decorated with tracing, and runs it. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, using standard libraries and patterns for observability. The security implications are minimal, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for telemetry and device control, with no malicious activity or security risks. The current scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are justified and appropriate.",
