{
  "purpose": "This code sets up tracing for a bluesky data collection plan and runs a simple plan that moves a detector motor to position 5.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (opentelemetry, ophyd, bluesky), the plan function input (det1._motor), and the plan execution (RE(test_tracing_plan()))",
  "sinks": "Trace exporter via ConsoleSpanExporter; the plan executes motor movement command",
  "flows": "Imports and setup flow into tracing configuration; the plan invocation flows into motor control",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; tracing is configured to output to console, no external network communication observed, plan performs a simple motor move",
  "analysis": "The code configures OpenTelemetry tracing with console export, applies tracing decorator to a bluesky plan, and executes the plan. No suspicious or malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, backdoors, or credential theft is present. The plan involves only a motor movement, typical in experimental control code. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for tracing a bluesky plan with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
