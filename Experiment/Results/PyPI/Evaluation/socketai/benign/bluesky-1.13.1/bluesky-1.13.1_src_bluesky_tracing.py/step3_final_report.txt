{
  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to wrap generator functions with an OpenTelemetry tracing span for monitoring execution.",
  "sources": "The tracer object obtained via get_tracer(__name__), and the generator function passed to the decorator.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The tracer.start_as_current_span() context manager surrounds the generator function execution, with no external data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward tracing decorator for generator functions, utilizing standard OpenTelemetry APIs. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or manipulate system resources maliciously. The structure is clear, and the purpose is instrumentation for monitoring. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature aligns with the low malware and security risk scores assigned in the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for tracing generator functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
