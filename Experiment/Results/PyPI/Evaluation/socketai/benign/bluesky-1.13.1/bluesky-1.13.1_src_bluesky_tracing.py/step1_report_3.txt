{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator function for tracing generator functions with OpenTelemetry, enabling span management during execution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, including OpenTelemetry tracer and utility functions",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; no network, file, or environment interactions",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly function wrapping for tracing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard tracing libraries and defines a decorator 'trace_plan' that wraps generator functions to add tracing spans. It correctly uses 'with' context for span management and employs type hints and functools.wraps for function integrity. No external data reading, no network activity, no insecure operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for adding tracing spans to generator functions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
