  "purpose": "Utility functions for plan visualization, simulation, limit checking, and message handling within the Bluesky framework, primarily for testing and analysis.",
  "sources": "Plan iterators, Msg objects, environment functions, and callback registration points.",
  "sinks": "Callback invocation, message processing, plotting functions, and limit checks.",
  "flows": "Messages flow from plan execution to callbacks, logging, and visualization; callback registration and invocation manage internal data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Callback mechanisms could be misused if malicious callbacks are registered, but none are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing utility for Bluesky plans, involving message handling, callback registration, plan simulation, and visualization. No external system interaction, network activity, or malicious code is evident. Callback mechanisms are flexible but not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for testing and visualization in Bluesky, with no malicious intent or security risks. The potential for misuse via callbacks exists in theory but is not realized here. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
