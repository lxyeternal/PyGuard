  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is purely a header containing license comments and a version variable assignment.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or executable logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n   - The code is standard for open-source projects, serving as metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Since the code is just a header with no executable or suspicious content, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the assessments are straightforward.\n   - No assumptions are unjustified; the code is minimal and standard.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code snippet is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n   - The scores reflect the benign nature correctly.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on all reviews, I concur with the assigned scores.\n- I would also assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk of 0.\n- The confidence remains at 1, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard license header and version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and typical for open-source projects.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.",
