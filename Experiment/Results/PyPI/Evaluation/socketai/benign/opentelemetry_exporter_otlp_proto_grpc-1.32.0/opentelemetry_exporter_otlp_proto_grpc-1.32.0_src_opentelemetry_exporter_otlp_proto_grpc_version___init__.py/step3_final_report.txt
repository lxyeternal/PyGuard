  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a license header and version declaration for the open-source project, providing metadata about the software version and licensing terms.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a static variable assignment (__version__ = \"1.32.0\").",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely informational.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or handle external data or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with only licensing comments and a version variable assignment, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard header containing licensing information and a version string. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and transparency mean it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header and version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or concern is warranted.",
