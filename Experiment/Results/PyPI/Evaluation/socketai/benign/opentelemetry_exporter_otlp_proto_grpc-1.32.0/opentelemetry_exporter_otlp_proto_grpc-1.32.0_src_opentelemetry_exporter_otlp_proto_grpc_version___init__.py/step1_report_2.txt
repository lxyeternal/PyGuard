  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, license information, and a single variable assignment for versioning. There are no input sources, external data reads, or untrusted data flows. No sinks, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard licensing and version declaration for an open-source project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version identifier and licensing info. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
