  "purpose": "This source code provides an implementation for exporting OpenTelemetry tracing data to an OTLP collector using gRPC, with configuration via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration, import statements, and the __version__ module for version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network connections or data leaks in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Configuration environment variables -> Exporter setup -> Trace span creation -> Export to OTLP collector.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of importing modules, setting a user-agent header, and configuring an OTLP exporter with static parameters. No input validation, no dynamic data handling that could lead to injection or leaks. All data flows are within controlled scope. The environment variables are for configuration only, and no sensitive data is embedded or transmitted within this snippet. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of a telemetry exporter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
