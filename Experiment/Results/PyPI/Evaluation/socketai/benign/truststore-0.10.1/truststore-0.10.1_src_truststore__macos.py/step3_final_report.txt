{
  "purpose": "The code interfaces with macOS security frameworks to perform SSL trust validation, handling certificates, hostnames, and trust evaluation via system APIs.",
  "sources": "Input certificates in DER format, hostnames, SSL context parameters, CA certificates from SSLContext.",
  "sinks": "CFString and CFData creation, trust evaluation functions, error message generation, resource management.",
  "flows": "Input data (certificates, hostnames) flows into CFData/CFString objects, then into trust evaluation APIs; trust results or errors propagate back.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Proper resource cleanup and error handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SSL trust validation on macOS, utilizing system libraries via ctypes. It handles certificates, hostnames, and trust evaluation with appropriate error handling and resource management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The extensive use of ctypes is typical for system API interfacing. The code adapts to different macOS versions correctly. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented SSL trust validation layer for macOS, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0. All reports are consistent and accurate.",
