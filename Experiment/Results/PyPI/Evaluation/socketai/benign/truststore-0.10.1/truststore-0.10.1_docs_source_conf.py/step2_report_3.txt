  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is standard configuration, importing 'datetime' and 'truststore' solely for metadata, with no untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n- **Verification:** The code indeed only imports modules, sets project info, theme, and extension lists, and accesses `truststore.__version__`. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, no data sinks.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected. Security risk is also correctly scored as 0.\n- **Potential concerns:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script is benign, with no suspicious code or data flows.\n- **Verification:** The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration, importing modules, setting variables, no dynamic or untrusted data.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and security risk scores are 0, which is justified.\n- **Potential concerns:** None. The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms that the code is standard configuration, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Verification:** Same as above, the code only reads version info and current date, with no external data handling.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Potential concerns:** None.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is benign, standard configuration, no malicious patterns.\n- **Verification:** The code only imports modules and sets configuration variables, with no dynamic or external data processing.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0; appropriate.\n- **Potential concerns:** None.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—benign configuration script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Verification:** Same as previous, straightforward setup.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware and security risk scores are 0, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code is purely configuration with no security implications.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- **Additional notes:** No changes needed; the code is benign and the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward configuration script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The existing reports and scores are appropriate.",
