  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting project metadata, extensions, theme, and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports 'datetime' and 'truststore'; accesses 'truststore.__version__'; reads current date.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, sets project metadata, configures Sphinx extensions and theme, and assigns version info from 'truststore.__version__'. It uses the current date for copyright. There are no dynamic evaluations, user inputs, or external data processing. The code is purely static configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for documentation purposes.",
