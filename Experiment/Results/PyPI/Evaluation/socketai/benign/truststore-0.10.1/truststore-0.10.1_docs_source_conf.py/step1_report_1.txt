  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues",
  "anomalies": "Use of truststore.__version__ without validation; no secrets or sensitive info in code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata and configuration options for documentation generation, including project info, theme, and extension settings. It imports 'truststore' solely to access its version, which is standard. There are no dynamic evaluations, input handling, or external data processing that could be exploited. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard configuration for documentation and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
