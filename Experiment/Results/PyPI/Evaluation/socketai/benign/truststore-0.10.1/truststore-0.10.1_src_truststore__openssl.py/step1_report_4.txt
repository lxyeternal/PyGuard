  "purpose": "Configure SSL context with trusted CA certificates, primarily to ensure secure SSL/TLS connections by setting the appropriate CA store.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SSL_CERT_FILE, SSL_CERT_DIR; default system certificate files and directories such as /etc/ssl/cert.pem, /etc/pki/tls/cert.pem, /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt, /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem; directory listing for certificate verification.",
  "sinks": "Loading CA certificates into SSLContext via load_verify_locations; reading directory contents for certificate files.",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables or default paths -> verifying file existence -> loading certificates into SSL context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected; code appears standard for configuring SSL trust store. The regular expression is straightforward, and there are no obfuscated or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines trusted CA certificate locations, checks system default verify paths, and loads CA certificates from common locations if defaults are unavailable. It also includes a helper to verify the presence of cert files in a directory. The verification function is a no-op, relying on SSLContext's built-in verification. No untrusted data flows or malicious patterns are present; the code follows standard SSL configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SSL configuration implementation with no signs of malicious intent. It correctly handles system CA certificates and is designed for secure SSL/TLS setup. No malware or security risks are detected.",
