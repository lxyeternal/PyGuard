  "sources": "ssl.get_default_verify_paths(), os.path.isfile(), os.listdir()",
  "sinks": "ssl.load_verify_locations()",
  "flows": "get_default_verify_paths() -> check for existing CA files or directories -> possibly load CA file from common locations -> verify peer certificates (no-op here)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The code primarily checks filesystem paths and configures SSL context accordingly. The _verify_peercerts_impl function is a no-op, which could be intentional or incomplete, but is not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes SSL verification settings by inspecting default verify paths. It attempts to load CA certificates from system locations or fallback candidates. The _capath_contains_certs function checks directories for cert files matching a specific pattern. The _verify_peercerts_impl function does nothing, likely relying on built-in SSL verification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a standard SSL configuration utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SSL setup helper, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The only point of interest is the placeholder/no-op peer certificate verification function, which may be intentional or incomplete but not malicious.",
