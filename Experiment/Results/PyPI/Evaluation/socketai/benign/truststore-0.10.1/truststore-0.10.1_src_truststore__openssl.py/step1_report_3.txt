  "purpose": "The code configures an SSL context with trusted CA certificates by searching common system locations and verifies peer certificates during SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables for SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR via ssl.get_default_verify_paths; checking file existence with os.path.isfile; listing directory contents with os.listdir.",
  "sinks": "Loading CA certificates into the SSL context with ctx.load_verify_locations; no other sinks related to untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Defaults from ssl.get_default_verify_paths are used to determine CA paths; if not suitable, the code searches specific file paths and directories; certificates are loaded into the SSL context to establish trust.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard system paths for CA certificates and proper directory/file checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SSL context configuration by checking default system paths and fallback locations for CA certificates, ensuring trusted verification during SSL connections. It uses regex to identify hashed certificate filenames, which is a typical pattern. The verify peer certificates function is a no-op, relying on the built-in verification mode. All operations use standard library functions with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation for configuring SSL trust stores using common system CA certificates. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
