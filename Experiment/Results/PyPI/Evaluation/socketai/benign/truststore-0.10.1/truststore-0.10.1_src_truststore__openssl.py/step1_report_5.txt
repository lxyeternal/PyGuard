  "purpose": "Configure SSL context with system CA certificates for secure communication",
  "sources": "Environment variables via ssl.get_default_verify_paths(), filesystem checks for CA cert files, reading directory contents with os.listdir()",
  "sinks": "Loading CA certificates into SSL context (load_verify_locations), checking file existence and directory contents",
  "flows": "ssl.get_default_verify_paths() -> file existence and directory checks -> ctx.load_verify_locations() with CA files",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward CA certificate loading logic, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an SSL context by checking system default paths for CA certificates, falling back to common file locations if defaults are invalid. It includes a regex for hashed certificate filenames and a helper to verify directory contents. The verify peer certificates function is a no-op, relying on built-in SSL verification. No external data inputs, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup for SSL certificate verification, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply manages CA certificates for SSL contexts securely.",
