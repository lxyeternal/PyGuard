  "flows": "Check default verify paths -> fallback to system locations if needed -> load CA certs into SSL context",
  "anomalies": "The _verify_peercerts_impl function is a no-op, which may indicate incomplete peer verification but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SSL context setup by checking default verify paths, falling back to common CA certificate locations, and loading them into the SSL context. The _verify_peercerts_impl function is a placeholder that does nothing, relying on SSLContext's built-in verification. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code follows best practices for SSL configuration and system CA trust setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SSL configuration utility that correctly loads system CA certificates. The no-op verification function is likely a placeholder and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
