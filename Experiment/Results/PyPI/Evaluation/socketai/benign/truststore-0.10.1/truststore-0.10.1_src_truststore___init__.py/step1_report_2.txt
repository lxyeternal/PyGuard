{
  "purpose": "Verify certificates using native system trust stores to ensure SSL/TLS security with compatibility checks for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version information from sys.version_info; importing ssl module; importing functions from local _api module.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of ssl MemoryBIO and create_default_context() which handle TLS certificates; import statements that load internal modules.",
  "flows": "Version check sources -> conditional import of ssl -> creation of ssl objects -> attribute check for API support -> import of internal API functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. The code performs environment detection and feature validation without any obfuscated or suspicious logic. The use of internal ssl attributes (_sslobj) and del statements are typical for compatibility layers.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment checks and compatibility validation for SSL certificate verification, ensuring that the required APIs are available based on Python version and implementation. It conditionally imports modules and internal functions, with no network activity, no data leakage, or malicious operations. The use of del statements to clean up references appears safe and standard for such compatibility code. No malicious behavior or malware indications are present. The logic is straightforward, with version and feature detection, and no suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility and environment validation script for SSL certificate verification. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious activity. The implementation appears standard and secure, focusing solely on ensuring SSL features are available for the package.",
