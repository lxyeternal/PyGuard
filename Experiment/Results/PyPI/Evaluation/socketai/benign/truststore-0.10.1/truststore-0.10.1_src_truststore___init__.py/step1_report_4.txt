{
  "purpose": "This code verifies certificates using the system's native trust stores and checks Python version compatibility for SSL features.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info and checks for the ssl module's import; also imports from a local module ._api.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations include importing ssl, creating MemoryBIO, and wrapping it with SSL context, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised.",
  "flows": "The code checks Python version; if compatible, attempts to import ssl, creates an SSL context, and verifies the presence of specific SSL API attributes; imports functions from local module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code dynamically checks SSL API availability based on Python version; no obfuscated code or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment and version checks, imports standard and local modules, and conditionally verifies SSL API availability. It uses standard Python modules without any obfuscation. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is a typical setup or compatibility layer for SSL certificate verification, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, version-dependent SSL verification utility, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is a standard implementation to ensure compatibility with different Python versions for SSL operations.",
