{
  "purpose": "The code verifies certificates using native system trust stores and ensures compatibility with specific Python versions and SSL API features.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version information from sys.version_info and sys.implementation, and imports modules such as ssl and a local module _api.",
  "sinks": "Uses ssl module functions, particularly wrap_bio, and accesses attributes like get_unverified_chain to determine SSL capabilities.",
  "flows": "Checks Python version -> imports ssl -> creates SSL context and MemoryBIO -> inspects SSL object for get_unverified_chain -> imports internal API functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual runtime behaviors; the code primarily performs environment and feature detection.",
  "analysis": "The script enforces minimum Python version 3.10 and checks for specific SSL API features based on Python version and implementation. It safely imports modules and conditionally creates SSL objects to verify API presence, raising ImportError if requirements aren't met. The code only performs environment and feature detection without executing any untrusted data or performing external network calls. It does not contain suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or privacy leaks. Usage of internal attributes (_sslobj) appears cautious and controlled. The import of a local API module is straightforward, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and environment check script for SSL certificate verification features in Python. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to ensure environment readiness for certificate verification functions. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
