{
  "purpose": "The code verifies certificates using the system's native trust stores, ensuring compatibility with specific Python versions and API availability.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info, imports ssl module, and imports internal functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted external sources or sensitive data leaks; no external network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "flows": "Checks Python version, conditionally imports ssl, attempts to instantiate and verify SSL objects, then deletes internal references to avoid leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal attributes such as _sslobj._sslobj and dynamic attribute access (hasattr, _sslobj = _sslobj._sslobj) could be unsafe or fragile; no secrets or credentials are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment checks, ensuring compatibility with specific Python versions and SSL API availability. It uses internal, non-public API attributes (_sslobj._sslobj) for API detection, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be standard version and feature detection logic for SSL-related capabilities. No suspicious external connections, credential handling, or code obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment validation and SSL API feature detection without any malicious behavior or security risks. Its use of internal API attributes is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
