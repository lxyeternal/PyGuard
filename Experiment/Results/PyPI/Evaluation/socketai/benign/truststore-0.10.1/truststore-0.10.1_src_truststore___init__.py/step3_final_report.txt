  "purpose": "Environment validation and SSL API support detection for compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Python version info, ssl module import, internal SSL object attributes (_sslobj._sslobj), and local _api module functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or data leaks; internal API attributes used for feature detection.",
  "flows": "Checks Python version -> imports ssl -> creates SSL object -> inspects internal attributes -> imports local API functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal, non-public SSL attributes (_sslobj._sslobj), which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation for Python version and SSL API availability, primarily to ensure compatibility with features like get_unverified_chain. It uses internal SSL attributes to detect support for certain APIs, which is an unconventional but known pattern for compatibility layers. There is no network activity, no handling of secrets, and no obfuscation. The internal attribute usage, while fragile, does not indicate malicious intent. No external data or untrusted input is processed. The code's purpose is benign, focused on environment detection, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and environment validation script for SSL certificate verification, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of internal SSL attributes is unconventional but not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
