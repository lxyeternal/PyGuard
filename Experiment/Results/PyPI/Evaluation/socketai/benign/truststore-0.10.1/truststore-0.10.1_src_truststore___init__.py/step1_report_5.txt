  "purpose": "Verify certificates using native system trust stores by checking Python version compatibility and SSL module capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info, imports ssl module, and imports internal API functions from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if imported modules or functions are malicious, but in this context, they are standard or internal imports. No external untrusted sources are read at runtime.",
  "flows": "The code checks Python version, attempts to import ssl, creates SSL memory BIO, wraps it in an SSL context, and inspects for specific SSL API attributes. These flows do not process untrusted input but verify environment capabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The only unusual aspect is dynamic attribute access and environment checks, which are standard for compatibility checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and API capability detection to ensure proper SSL certificate verification. It raises errors if Python version is too low or if required SSL APIs are unavailable. The dynamic attribute access (_sslobj = _sslobj._sslobj) could be considered advanced but is typical for compatibility layers. No external data inputs, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no suspicious external network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard environment compatibility check for SSL certificate verification, with no malicious intent or malicious code behavior detected. It relies on standard library imports and internal APIs, with no signs of malicious modifications.",
