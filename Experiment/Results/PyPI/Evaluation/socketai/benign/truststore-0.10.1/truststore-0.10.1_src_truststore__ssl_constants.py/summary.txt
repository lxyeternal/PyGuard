  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SSL configuration utility capable of modifying verification modes. While it could be misused to disable SSL verification and weaken security, there is no evidence of malicious intent or payloads. The current security risk score of approximately 0.4 is appropriate given its potential for misuse. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0."
