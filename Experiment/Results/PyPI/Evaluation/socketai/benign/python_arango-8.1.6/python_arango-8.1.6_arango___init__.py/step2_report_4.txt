  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify that the code only consists of import statements from the 'arango' library.\n- No executable code, data flows, or network activity are present.\n- Wildcard imports ('import *') are flagged as poor practice but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are consistently low (mostly 0), with some slightly higher confidence levels.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code only imports modules and classes; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard imports (`from arango.exceptions import *`, `from arango.http import *`). While this is discouraged for code clarity and maintainability, it is not inherently malicious.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are introduced by these import statements alone.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal concern primarily due to poor coding practices (wildcard imports). This seems reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  Ranging from 0.8 to 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The scores are mostly below or around 0.1-0.2, indicating low risk.\n- The only notable point is the use of wildcard imports, which could potentially hide malicious imports if the package were compromised, but this is speculative.\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they only describe import statements.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements.\n- Wildcard imports are a code quality concern but not a security threat.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to poor practice of wildcard imports, but not a security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is not malicious and does not pose a security threat. The main concern is coding style, not security.",
