  "purpose": "Import statements for the 'arango' Python driver, setting up database interaction.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'arango' modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "None; only static import statements, no data or network flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('import *') from 'arango.exceptions' and 'arango.http', which is poor practice but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. Wildcard imports are discouraged but do not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily reflecting poor coding practice rather than security vulnerability. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.8-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements necessary for database setup. No malicious or security issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; wildcard imports are a coding style concern but do not constitute security risks.",
