  "purpose": "Import statements for the ArangoDB Python client library, likely setting up for database interaction.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'arango' library modules: errno, ArangoClient, exceptions, and http.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet; it's only imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow visible, as this code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all imports are from standard library and open-source 'arango' package. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from the 'arango' package, a known database driver for ArangoDB. The use of 'import *' in exceptions and http modules is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. There are no data reads, external network calls, or suspicious code execution. The code appears to be standard setup code for database interaction without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard for setting up database connectivity with ArangoDB. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected in this snippet.",
