  "sources": "Import statements for modules and exceptions within the 'arango' library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no code execution or data handling beyond imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all imports are standard and from an established library. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for the 'arango' database driver, including specific modules and all exceptions and HTTP classes via wildcard imports. There are no executable code, input handling, or untrusted data flows. The imports are typical for a script that interacts with ArangoDB. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import pattern for the 'arango' Python driver. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues within these import statements.",
