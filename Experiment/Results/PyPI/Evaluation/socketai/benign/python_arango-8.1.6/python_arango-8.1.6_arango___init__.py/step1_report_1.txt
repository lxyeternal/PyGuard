  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and classes from the 'arango' library, likely for database interaction.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and classes from 'arango' library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows indicating untrusted data handling or potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No executable code present; only import statements, so no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('from arango.exceptions import *' and 'from arango.http import *') can be considered poor practice but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from the 'arango' library, which is a driver for interacting with ArangoDB. The wildcard imports may be flagged for code quality but do not suggest malicious intent. No data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. This snippet does not pose an immediate security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code only imports modules and classes from the 'arango' library without performing any actions or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based on this snippet.",
