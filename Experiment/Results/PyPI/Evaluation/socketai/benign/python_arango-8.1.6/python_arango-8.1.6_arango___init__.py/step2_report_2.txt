  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from the 'arango' library.\n- No executable code, data flows, or network activity are present.\n- The use of wildcard imports ('import *') from 'arango.exceptions' and 'arango.http' is noted as poor practice but not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The confidence levels are high, and the malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; only import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly notes poor practice of wildcard imports but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, confidence 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security risk.\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n- Same as above; consistent reasoning and scoring.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, confidence 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n- Slightly higher confidence (1), but still no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard import pattern, no malicious activity.\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n- Notes wildcard imports as a code quality concern, which is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, confidence 0.8 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n- Correctly identifies only import statements with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, confidence 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all reports, justified as poor practice of wildcard imports but not a security risk per se.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The **securityRisk** score could be lowered to 0, since these are just import statements without any data handling or network activity.\n- The **malware** score remains at 0, which is correct.\n- The **obfuscated** score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Security risk score:** Reduce from 0.1 to 0, as no actual security risk exists in this import-only code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the overall assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate, with the exception of the minimal security risk score which can be lowered to zero.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **securityRisk:** 0\n\nThis reflects that the code is purely import statements with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
