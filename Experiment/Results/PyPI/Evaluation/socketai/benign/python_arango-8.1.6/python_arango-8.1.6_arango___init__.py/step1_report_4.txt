  "purpose": "Import statements for ArangoDB client library components",
  "sources": "Imports modules and specific classes/functions from the 'arango' package",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow present; only import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') from 'arango.exceptions' and 'arango.http' which can hide used functions or classes and make analysis difficult; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code evident",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from the 'arango' package, including specific modules and wildcard imports. Wildcard imports can obscure the actual imported names and potentially import malicious or unwanted classes/functions if the package is compromised, though this is not necessarily malicious in itself. No other code, data handling, or dynamic execution is present. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The imports are typical for a client library setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely import statements from a standard database client library with wildcard imports that could be considered a code quality concern but are not inherently malicious. No malware or security risks are apparent from this snippet.",
