  "purpose": "A wrapper for managing ArangoDB Foxx services, including installation, update, deletion, configuration, and script execution.",
  "sources": "File paths for source code, request parameters, response bodies, and configuration/dependencies data.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to API endpoints, file reads via open(), response handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and files flow into HTTP requests; responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context management, minor resource leak potential; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions for managing services, with straightforward file handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only concern is resource management due to open() usage without 'with', but this does not constitute a security risk. The request and response handling appear correct, and no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for Foxx service management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minor resource leak issue is acknowledged but does not impact security assessment.",
