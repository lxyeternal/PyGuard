  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The code provides a wrapper for managing Foxx services on an ArangoDB server, including installation, update, deletion, configuration, and testing of services.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Input data sources include method parameters (e.g., 'mount', 'filename', 'config'), file reading via 'open(filename, \"rb\")' in '_encode', and response bodies from server responses.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Potential data sinks include 'request' objects sending data over the network, particularly in methods that upload files, update configurations, dependencies, or invoke scripts. Response data is also returned directly to callers.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Data flows from input parameters to request payloads ('data', 'params'), especially through '_encode' when uploading files. Responses from server calls are processed via 'response_handler' functions, which may format or return raw data.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The '_encode' method reads files directly from disk without validation or sanitization of 'filename', which could be exploited if filename is externally controlled. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The use of open() is standard but can be risky if filenames are not validated elsewhere. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are evident. The code includes many exception raises for failed server responses, which is standard.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper for managing Foxx services on ArangoDB. It uses standard request and response handling patterns, with file uploads managed via 'MultipartEncoder' and network requests made with explicit parameters and data. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The only potential concern is the direct file reading from 'filename' without validation, which might be misused if filenames are not sanitized externally. The code does not contain any hidden or malicious behavior; it performs typical management operations for services. No signs of malware, data leaks, or sabotage are identified.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for managing Foxx services. It does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The only minor concern relates to file handling without internal validation, which is likely managed externally. Overall, the code appears safe and purposeful.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
