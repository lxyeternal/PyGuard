  "purpose": "Define a comprehensive set of exception classes for error handling in the python-arango library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializations, no external data input or output operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; all classes are simple exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to various errors in the python-arango library. Each class inherits from a base error class and provides contextual error information. No input/output, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for error handling in a database client library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
