  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure the correctness of the security assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports state that the code is solely class definitions for exception hierarchies in the python-arango library.\n- They emphasize the absence of data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is to facilitate structured error handling.\n- The overall conclusion in all reports is that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code content confirmation:**\n   - The code contains only class definitions inheriting from built-in exception classes.\n   - The `ArangoServerError` class's `__init__` method assigns attributes based on response/request objects.\n   - No functions perform data processing, external communication, or execute code dynamically.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - The exception classes are well-structured, with no logical flaws or security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No reason to assign higher scores since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime or external interactions.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly analyze the code as purely class definitions.\n   - No overreach or unwarranted suspicion.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy with no security issues.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms the code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
