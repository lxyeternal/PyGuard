{
  "purpose": "This code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for handling errors in a Python client library for ArangoDB, covering various operational, server, and component-specific errors.",
  "sources": "None (only class definitions and exception hierarchies; no data input or external data reads).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "None (no data flows or external communication within the code).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive class and exception definitions with no evident anomalies or unusual code constructs. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of exception hierarchies.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, establishing multiple custom exception classes for different error scenarios in a Python ArangoDB client library. There are no functions, data manipulations, or input/output operations that could lead to security issues. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The classes only inherit from base exception classes and store error-related information. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as code injection, data leakage, or system disruption are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for error handling in a Python client library. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
