  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, purpose, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions used in the python-arango client library.\n- There are no functions, data processing, external data reads, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The classes are well-structured, inheriting from base exception classes, and serve to categorize errors for better error handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a very low or zero risk score, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n\n- The only slight concern might be the extensive exception hierarchy, but this is standard for robust error handling in a client library.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, such as hidden malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for a Python client library.\n- It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- I agree with the assessments provided in all reports.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The code is safe, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.           |\n| Risk           | 0                 | No security risks identified; purely class definitions.    |\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for its intended purpose.",
