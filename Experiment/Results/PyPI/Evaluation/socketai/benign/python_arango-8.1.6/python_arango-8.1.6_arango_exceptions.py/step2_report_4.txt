  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception hierarchies for a Python ArangoDB client, with no data processing, external input, or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that the code is purely class definitions with no suspicious patterns. No anomalies, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the lack of external data handling, input/output, or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The observation is accurate; the code is straightforward exception class hierarchies. No hidden malicious patterns or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is only class definitions, with no external data, network, or runtime logic.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is static, structured, and free from malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is purely class definitions for error handling, with no external interactions or malicious behaviors.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is standard for exception hierarchies.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: static exception class definitions, no runtime or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Code presence:** No, only class definitions.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk level:** Essentially zero; the code is a standard exception hierarchy for error handling.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for a client library. No signs of supply chain or security risks are present.\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned by the reports are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.",
