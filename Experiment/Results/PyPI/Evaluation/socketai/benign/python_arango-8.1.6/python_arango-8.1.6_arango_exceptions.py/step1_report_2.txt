{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various error conditions in the python-arango library, including server, client, and specific database operation errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; no network, file, or environment variable access is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input to output; the code only defines exception classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; the code is purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of custom exception classes for the python-arango library, structured to categorize errors originating from client-side, server responses, specific database operations, and other subsystems like replication, clusters, and security. There are no input/output operations, external calls, or dynamic code execution present. The classes inherit from standard exception classes and are used to handle error conditions explicitly in the library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated code are detected. All classes serve as structured error representations, and the implementation is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured collection of exception class definitions for error handling in the python-arango library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It solely defines exception hierarchies without runtime execution or external interactions.",
