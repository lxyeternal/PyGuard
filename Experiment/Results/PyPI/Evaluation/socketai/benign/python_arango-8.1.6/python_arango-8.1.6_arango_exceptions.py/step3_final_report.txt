{
  "purpose": "This code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the python-arango client library, categorizing errors related to server, client, and specific functionalities. It serves to facilitate structured error handling and reporting within the library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from the class definitions and their attributes; no external data sources, user input, or network interactions are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code only declares exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted data; the classes are static and serve as error containers, not executing or processing data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is a straightforward hierarchy of exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base exception classes, with attributes for error details. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The structure is standard for error handling in a Python client library. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of exception class definitions used for error handling in the python-arango library. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, confirming its safety.",
