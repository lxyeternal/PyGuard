{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of exception classes for handling various errors in the python-arango library, primarily for structured error reporting and debugging.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static and do not perform data input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; these are exception class definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling with no runtime logic, input/output operations, or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a static set of exception class definitions for error handling within the python-arango package. It includes various specific exceptions for different error scenarios related to ArangoDB interactions, such as server errors, database operations, collections, transactions, and more. There are no functions, network operations, file handling, or dynamic code execution. The classes store error metadata but do not execute malicious actions or include hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a well-structured error hierarchy designed for clarity and detailed error reporting, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining exception classes for structured error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. It appears safe and intended solely for error management within the package.",
