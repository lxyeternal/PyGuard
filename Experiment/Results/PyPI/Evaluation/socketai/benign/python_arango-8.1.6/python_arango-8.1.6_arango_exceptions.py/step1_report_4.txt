  "purpose": "Define a comprehensive hierarchy of exception classes for error handling in the python-arango library, covering various aspects of ArangoDB operations and features.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing and arango.request.Response / arango.response.Request classes; class definitions with attributes and initializers.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(msg) calls passing error messages; setting attributes like self.message, self.error_message, self.url, self.response, self.request, etc.",
  "flows": "Error message generation and propagation via exception initializers; attribute assignments from Response and Request objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or data leaks; no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns; code primarily defines exception classes and attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for error handling in a database client library, with no input/output handling, external data, or network operations. Attributes are used to store error details, and the hierarchy covers a wide range of error scenarios. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The structure is standard for an exception hierarchy in Python, and the code is straightforward, readable, and secure. There is no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The purpose is clearly to facilitate error reporting within the library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious hierarchy of exception classes for error handling in the python-arango client library. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The implementation is conventional and secure.",
