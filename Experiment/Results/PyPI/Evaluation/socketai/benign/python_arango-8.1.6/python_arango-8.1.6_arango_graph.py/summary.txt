  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for ArangoDB's graph management. It does not contain malicious code or backdoors. The only notable risk stems from passing user-supplied JavaScript functions to the server, which could be exploited if malicious scripts are provided. However, this is a documented feature of the API, not a flaw or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low, approximately 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of executing untrusted scripts on the server within a sandboxed environment."
