{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for constructing HTTP requests with normalized headers and parameters, specifically for interfacing with ArangoDB.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as headers, params, and constructor arguments for the Request class.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs normalized headers and parameters, and constructs a Request object. No direct sinks for untrusted data lead to security issues are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into normalization functions, which process and store them into class attributes. The data is then used for HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions and a data container class.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard normalization of headers and parameters for HTTP requests and encapsulates request data within a class. It does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to code execution, nor does it include network operations or credential handling that could be malicious. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for request construction with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and secure, serving its purpose without introducing vulnerabilities.",
