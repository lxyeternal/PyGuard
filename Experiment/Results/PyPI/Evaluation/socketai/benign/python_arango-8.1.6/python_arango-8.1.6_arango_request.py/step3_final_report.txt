{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for normalizing HTTP headers and URL parameters, and encapsulates request details in a class for constructing HTTP requests to ArangoDB.",
  "sources": "Input headers, parameters, and driver flags provided during Request object initialization.",
  "sinks": "Normalized headers and parameters stored within the Request object; no external sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through normalization functions and into the Request class attributes without executing external code or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward normalization and data encapsulation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple data normalization for headers and URL parameters, converting booleans to integers, lowercasing header keys, and concatenating driver flags into a header string. The Request class initializes with these normalized values, serving as a data container for HTTP request details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The functions and class are standard for request handling in a database driver context, with no external network activity or sensitive data handling that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for request normalization and encapsulation, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
