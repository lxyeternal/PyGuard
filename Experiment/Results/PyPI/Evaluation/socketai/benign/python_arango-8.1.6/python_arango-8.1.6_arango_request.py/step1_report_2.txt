{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions and a class for constructing and normalizing HTTP requests to an ArangoDB server, focusing on headers, parameters, and request structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: headers, driver_flags, params, and the constructor arguments of the Request class.",
  "sinks": "The primary sinks are the normalized headers and parameters that are used in HTTP requests. No direct untrusted data is passed into system calls or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers, params, driver_flags) flows into normalization functions, then into the Request object which prepares data for HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present. No external network calls, cryptographic operations, or file manipulations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward normalization of headers and parameters with no use of untrusted data in dangerous contexts. It constructs a Request object with sanitized inputs. The code appears to be a typical request setup utility with no malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, focusing on request setup and normalization without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The design and implementation are standard for such utilities.",
