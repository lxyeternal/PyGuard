{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for constructing HTTP requests with normalized headers and parameters for a database driver.",
  "sources": "Function inputs: headers, params, driver_flags, method, endpoint, data, read, write, exclusive; class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of headers and params if they contain malicious or untrusted data, but no direct sink is explicitly exploited in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers, params) is processed through normalization functions and assigned to class attributes without evident dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs straightforward data normalization and object initialization without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for normalizing headers and URL parameters, then constructs a Request object with those normalized values. It handles optional inputs gracefully, converting boolean params to integers and stringifying all params. There are no dynamic code executions, external network interactions, or suspicious behaviors. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be standard, safe request handling logic for a database driver.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for creating HTTP request objects with normalization; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe with no evidence of supply chain or malicious activity.",
