{
  "purpose": "Define an HTTP request class for interacting with an ArangoDB database, including header and parameter normalization.",
  "sources": "Input data includes optional headers, parameters, and driver flags passed to normalization functions and the constructor of the Request class.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks for untrusted data leading to security issues such as code execution, data leaks, or external communication within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the constructor parameters into normalization functions, then into class attributes; no external or untrusted data is directed to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for normalizing headers and parameters, then defines a Request class that encapsulates HTTP request data for database interaction. Data is sanitized and organized before use. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or code injection. The code relies on standard practices, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard implementation for request handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely manages and prepares request data for further processing, without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
