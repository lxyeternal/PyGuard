{
  "purpose": "Manage and iterate over query results from ArangoDB, fetching data in batches and maintaining cursor state.",
  "sources": "Server responses via send_request, request endpoint construction, response body parsing.",
  "sinks": "Internal state updates, cursor ID, batch data, statistics, warnings, profile, plan.",
  "flows": "Server responses are received through send_request, processed by _update, and stored in internal attributes; fetch() sends requests to server; next() retrieves data from internal batch or fetches new batch.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a database cursor wrapper for ArangoDB. It handles server responses securely, updating internal state without executing untrusted code. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The request handling uses standard patterns, and response data is processed carefully. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, which is typical for a client library component managing server communication. The low risk reflects the inherent network interaction but does not indicate any security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of a database cursor wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security and malware scores are justified and should remain at zero, with a minimal risk score around 0.1-0.2 due to network interactions. No modifications are necessary based on the provided analysis.",
