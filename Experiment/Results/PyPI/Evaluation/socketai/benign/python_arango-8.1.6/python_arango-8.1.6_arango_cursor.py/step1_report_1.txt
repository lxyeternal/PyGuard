{
  "purpose": "Wrapper class for handling database query cursors in ArangoDB, fetching results in batches.",
  "sources": "Reads data from server responses (resp.body), and possibly from internal attributes during fetch and update methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses the request object to send data to server; no evident data leaks or injections present in this code.",
  "flows": "Server response data flows into _update method, which updates internal state and batch; fetch method requests data from server, updates cursor state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual variable use. The code primarily manages server communication and internal state.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Cursor class for managing database query result batching with standard request-response handling. The data flow involves receiving JSON responses from the server, updating internal attributes, and returning data to callers. No unsafe or malicious behavior is evident; the class handles network communication via well-defined request objects, updates internal state securely, and manages exceptions appropriately. No signs of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code's structure and logic are consistent with typical database cursor management, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured database cursor wrapper with no malicious behavior detected. It securely manages server interactions and internal state without any indicators of sabotage or malware.",
