  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of a database cursor wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security and malware scores are justified and should remain at zero, with a minimal risk score around 0.1-0.2 due to network interactions. No modifications are necessary based on the provided analysis."
