  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flows, anomalies, and conclusions, and then assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard cursor wrapper, handling server responses, updating internal state, and fetching data. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The risk score of 0.2 seems to reflect a minimal inherent risk in network communication, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions, safe data handling, and no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of anomalies. The explanation confirms no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on network request handling, server response processing, and internal state management, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is appropriate given the normal operation, and no malware concerns are indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard cursor management with safe data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the other reports; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical implementation with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The very low risk score is justified, and no malware or obfuscation concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—it's a straightforward database cursor wrapper with no malicious payloads, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear, well-structured, and readable. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, reflecting the inherent risk in network communication and server interaction, which is standard and acceptable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, typical for database client code, no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, secure implementation of a database cursor wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk scores are reasonable and appropriately low.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the assessments are justified based on the code and reports provided.",
