  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard cursor wrapper, handling server responses securely, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs typical cursor management, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score aligns with this.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request-response handling, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is appropriate given the lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data flow via server responses, standard request handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard API interaction, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The risk score reflects a low likelihood of security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms standard cursor management, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's nature—client-side API wrapper—this is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of a database cursor wrapper.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The data flow is straightforward, with server responses updating internal state.\n- The request handling is typical and secure.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to 0.2), as already assigned, is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The existing reports' scores are reasonable and justified. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, well-structured, and standard for database client libraries.  \n- The scoring accurately reflects the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, with minimal security risk.",
