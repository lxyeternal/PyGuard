  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only calls setup() with no arguments.",
  "flows": "Import of setuptools module -> call to setup() with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Calling setup() without arguments is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal package setup script. It imports setup from setuptools and executes setup() with default parameters. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and lack of data flow to external systems indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores reflect negligible risk.",
