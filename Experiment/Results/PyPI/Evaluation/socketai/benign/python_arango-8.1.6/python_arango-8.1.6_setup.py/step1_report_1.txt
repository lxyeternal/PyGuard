{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function from setuptools, which reads setup configuration when called.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function itself, which may write files or modify environment during installation.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., package metadata, configuration) flows into 'setup()', which executes installation routines.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only calling 'setup()' with no arguments, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it without parameters. This triggers the standard package setup process. There are no additional instructions, data handling, or configuration. Since 'setup()' is used normally for package distribution, and no malicious code or data flow is evident, this appears to be a simple, benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, non-malicious package setup script. It performs no suspicious or malicious actions and adheres to normal package setup practices.",
