  "purpose": "Unit test for the 'tokenize' function in the 'rouge_score' library, verifying token splitting correctness.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded input strings within test cases.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed directly by 'tokenize.tokenize' without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static unit test suite that tests tokenization with hardcoded strings. It involves no external input, network activity, or dynamic data. The code structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with this assessment. The confidence level is high, given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a straightforward unit test. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
