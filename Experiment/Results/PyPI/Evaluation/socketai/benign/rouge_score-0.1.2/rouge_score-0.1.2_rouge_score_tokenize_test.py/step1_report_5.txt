  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'tokenize' module of the rouge_score package.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only internal function calls with hardcoded strings in test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only tests a function with hardcoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite using absltest for the 'tokenize' function. It calls 'tokenize' with predefined string inputs and compares against expected outputs. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The license and copyright comments are standard. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The overall structure is typical for unit tests.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard test script for the 'tokenize' function. No malicious activity, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
