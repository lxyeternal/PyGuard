{
  "purpose": "The code provides tests for the rouge scoring and aggregation functions, ensuring correctness and consistency with expected values.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files specified by test_util.LARGE_TARGETS_FILE and test_util.LARGE_PREDICTIONS_FILE.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects; no data is sent over networks, written to sensitive locations, or used in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input (targets and predictions) into scoring and aggregation functions; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks that cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is standard testing code with file reading and scoring operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing and scoring modules, reads input data files, and performs statistical aggregation tests on rouge scores. There are no dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling. The code is structured as a unit test suite, primarily for validation purposes, and does not contain any code that could be used maliciously. It uses fixed random seeds and reads from specific files without processing untrusted user input. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test suite for scoring validation with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs file-based data reading, scoring, and aggregation checks. There are no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities in this code segment.",
