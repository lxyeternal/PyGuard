{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for rouge scoring and aggregation, validating correctness and consistency with the perl ROUGE implementation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from static files via 'test_util' module, including large target and prediction files, and files in 'PYROUGE_DIR'.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or untrusted data sinks; all data processed internally within the test environment.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files, performs scoring using 'rouge_scorer', aggregates results with 'scoring.BootstrapAggregator', and asserts expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite operating in a controlled environment. It reads static data, performs scoring, and asserts expected outcomes. No network activity, no handling of secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious code. Use of fixed random seeds and known files indicates a deterministic testing setup. No external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe test suite for the 'rouge_score' package, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its benign and controlled nature.",
