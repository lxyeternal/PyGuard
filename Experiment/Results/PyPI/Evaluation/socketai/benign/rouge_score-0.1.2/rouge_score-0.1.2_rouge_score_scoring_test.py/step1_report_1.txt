{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for rouge scoring and aggregation used to validate the correctness and consistency of rouge score calculations in the 'rouge_score' package.",
  "sources": "Reads data from files 'LARGE_TARGETS_FILE' and 'LARGE_PREDICTIONS_FILE' via test_util, and from text files in the test directory.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that process untrusted input directly; test results are internal and do not transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads target and prediction texts from files, processes them with rouge_scorer, adds scores to aggregator, and computes aggregated scores.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs standard testing procedures using known files and library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, third-party modules, and internal modules related to rouge scoring. It uses fixed file paths and a fixed random seed for reproducibility, indicating controlled testing environment. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input is observed. The code performs standard file I/O, scoring, and assertions. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. Overall, it is a typical test suite with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test suite for validating rouge scoring functionalities. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or security risks. It operates solely within a controlled testing environment with static data. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
