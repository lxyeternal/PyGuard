  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'tokenizers' module in the 'rouge_score' package, specifically testing default tokenization with and without stemming.",
  "sources": "Imports 'absl.testing' and 'rouge_score.tokenizers'; reads test input strings within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; test code does not process external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Input strings are tokenized via the 'tokenize' method, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; code consists of standard unit test structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing using the absltest framework. It initializes tokenizers with and without stemming and verifies token outputs. No external data, network activity, or malicious code present. The code appears well-structured and straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for a tokenization library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
