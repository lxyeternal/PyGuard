  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tokenizers module in rouge_score, validating default tokenization behavior with and without stemming.",
  "sources": "Imports absl.testing and rouge_score.tokenizers; reads test input strings in test methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output operations that could leak data.",
  "flows": "Test input strings flow through tokenizer.tokenize() method, but this is standard behavior and not risky.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing of tokenizer functionality, utilizing standard testing frameworks and the tokenizers library. There are no suspicious code constructs, no dynamic execution, and no handling of untrusted input or sensitive data. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard unit test code for validating tokenizer behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
