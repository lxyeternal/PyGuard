  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'tokenizers' module within the 'rouge_score' package, verifying tokenization with and without stemming.",
  "sources": "Static string inputs in test methods; no external data or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Initialization of tokenizers -> tokenization of static strings -> assertion checks; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code with clear logic and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static unit test suite for tokenizer functionality, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It performs basic assertions on static strings, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. All reports concur on its safety, and the high confidence scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
