{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tokenizers module in the rouge_score library to verify tokenizer behavior with and without stemming.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings in the test methods, specifically in tokenizer.tokenize() calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no untrusted data is passed to potentially dangerous functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input strings are tokenized, and the results are compared; no data flows to external or sensitive components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward test suite using absltest to verify the behavior of tokenizers with different configurations. It imports necessary modules, creates instances of tokenizers, performs tokenization on static strings, and asserts expected token outputs. There are no external data inputs, no use of eval or exec, no network calls, no credential handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The overall structure is typical for a unit test file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard test suite with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply tests the expected functionality of a tokenizer component.",
