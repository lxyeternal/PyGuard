{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tokenizers module in the rouge_score package, specifically testing default tokenizer behavior with and without stemming.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses hardcoded strings within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output sinks; tests are self-contained and do not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; tests validate tokenizer output on static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code is straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing framework and the tokenizers module. It creates a test class with two test methods, each initializing a tokenizer instance with different parameters. The tests run tokenization on static strings and verify the output. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for a test suite, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for tokenizer functionality, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code detected. It appears safe and serves a testing purpose only.",
