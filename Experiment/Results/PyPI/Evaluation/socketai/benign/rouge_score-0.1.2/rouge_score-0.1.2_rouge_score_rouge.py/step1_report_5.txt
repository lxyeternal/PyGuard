  "purpose": "Calculate ROUGE scores between target and prediction text files for evaluation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input file patterns specified by command-line flags; imports modules from rouge_score package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network transmissions; outputs results to a CSV file as specified.",
  "flows": "Input file patterns -> rouge_scorer and io modules process files -> compute_scores_and_write_to_csv writes output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or unusual variables.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard evaluation tool for calculating ROUGE scores. It uses command-line flags for input/output paths, loads scoring modules, and performs straightforward file processing and output generation. No signs of malicious behavior, external network connections, or data exfiltration activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate evaluation utility for ROUGE metrics with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as intended, with proper handling of input/output and no suspicious behaviors.",
