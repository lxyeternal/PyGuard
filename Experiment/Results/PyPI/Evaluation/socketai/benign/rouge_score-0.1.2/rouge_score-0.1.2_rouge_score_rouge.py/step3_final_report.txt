  "purpose": "A CLI utility for computing ROUGE scores between text files, designed to replicate the scoring of the Perl implementation.",
  "sources": "Input file patterns for target and prediction texts, read from specified files.",
  "sinks": "Output CSV file containing the computed ROUGE scores.",
  "flows": "Reads text data from input files, processes with rouge_scorer, and writes results to CSV.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation utilizing standard open-source libraries (absl, rouge_score). It defines command-line flags, initializes scoring objects, and processes files without any dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The minimal security risk scores assigned in some reports are justified as conservative estimates, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for calculating ROUGE scores. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low security risk scores are appropriate and reflect the benign nature of the script.",
