{
  "purpose": "The script calculates ROUGE scores for text files, primarily for evaluating text summarization models, by reading target and prediction files and outputting results in CSV format.",
  "sources": "User-specified file patterns for target and prediction text files, command-line flags for configurations.",
  "targets": "The flags for file patterns and output filename are set via command-line input; no other external sources are read.",
  "flows": "Input file patterns are read from command-line flags, processed by io.compute_scores_and_write_to_csv, which likely reads the files and writes CSV output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard for this purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a command-line interface for scoring text files using the rouge_score library. It imports necessary modules, defines flags for user inputs, and invokes scoring functions accordingly. No untrusted data sources are directly handled beyond user-provided file patterns, and the code does not execute external commands or manipulate data insecurely. The use of flags for user input is typical, and there are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears standard, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation for computing ROUGE scores with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on user-specified files and outputs the results without executing external commands or handling sensitive data internally. No malware or security threats are detected.",
