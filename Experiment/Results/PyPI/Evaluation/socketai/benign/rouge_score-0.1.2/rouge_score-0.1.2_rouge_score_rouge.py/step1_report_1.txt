{
  "purpose": "The script calculates ROUGE scores for text files, comparing predicted texts against target texts, and outputs the results in CSV format.",
  "sources": "Input file patterns specified by command-line flags ('target_filepattern' and 'prediction_filepattern'), environment variables (via absl.flags), and the script's internal modules.",
  "sinks": "Output file specified by 'output_filename'; no other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "File pattern inputs -> io.compute_scores_and_write_to_csv -> CSV output; internal use of scorer and aggregator modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs are observed. The code relies on well-known libraries and standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward implementation for scoring text similarity using the ROUGE metric, with no dynamic code execution or external network communication. It utilizes standard third-party libraries and the absl framework, with command-line flags for configuration. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for evaluating text summaries with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations without suspicious behavior.",
