{
  "purpose": "Calculate ROUGE scores across text files to evaluate summarization quality, replicating Perl implementation results.",
  "sources": "Reads input file patterns for targets and predictions, and writes output CSV score file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to specified CSV file; no untrusted data used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "File pattern inputs → score computation via rouge_scorer and io modules → results written to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses standard libraries and legitimate scoring functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines flags for input/output files and options. It initializes a ROUGE scorer with options like stemming and split summaries, then computes scores and writes results to CSV. The overall structure is straightforward, with no indications of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or code injection. The modules imported are open-source and focused on scoring text. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected. It uses standard, well-documented libraries for legitimate scoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate ROUGE scoring for text evaluation. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected. It follows expected practices for such a utility.",
