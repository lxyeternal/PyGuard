{
  "purpose": "Calculate ROUGE scores for text files to evaluate summarization or translation quality, replicating the Perl ROUGE implementation.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line flags, including file patterns and options for processing.",
  "sinks": "Data written to specified output CSV file; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input file patterns are read by io.compute_scores_and_write_to_csv, processed by rouge_scorer and scoring, results are written to CSV.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. Uses standard libraries and well-known modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard future features, sets up command-line flags for input parameters, and initializes a scorer object from the rouge_score library with user-specified options. It then calls a function to process input files, compute ROUGE scores, and output results to a CSV file. The code structure follows typical pattern for CLI tools and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. No code injections, network operations, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for calculating ROUGE scores without any malicious intent. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indicators. The code is straightforward and uses open-source modules responsibly.",
