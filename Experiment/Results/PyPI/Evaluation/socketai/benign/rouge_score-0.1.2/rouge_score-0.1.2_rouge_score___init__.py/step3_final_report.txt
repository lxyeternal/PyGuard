  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing comments and legal notices, serving as a licensing header for the 'rouge_score' project.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources, input, or data reading operations; only static comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as there is no executable code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present; the snippet is purely licensing boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of licensing comments with no executable logic, data input/output, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the lack of malicious or risky content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign licensing header with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the content, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
