  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'rouge_score' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static code in the setup script.",
  "sinks": "Potentially none, as no untrusted data or external inputs are used in sinks.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content (source) to assign to 'long_description'; static dependencies installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious code patterns or malicious activities detected. The dependencies are common and do not include any suspicious packages. Overall, the code appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
