  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'rouge_score' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading a local README file.",
  "sources": "Reading the local 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Static data from file read into package setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static 'setup.py' script that imports setuptools, reads a local file, and calls setuptools.setup() with predefined metadata and dependencies. No dynamic input, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and contains no obfuscation or secrets. All signals indicate a benign, well-formed package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
