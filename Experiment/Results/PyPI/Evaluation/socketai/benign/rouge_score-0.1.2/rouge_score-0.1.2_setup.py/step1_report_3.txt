{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'rouge_score' Python package, used to install the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; no other input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script primarily reads static files and invokes setuptools to manage installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions and does not include obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file for description content and uses setuptools to configure package installation. The dependencies listed are common Python packages ('absl-py', 'nltk', 'numpy', 'six') with no dynamic or untrusted input handling. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no network operations, no credential handling, or other risky behaviors. The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
