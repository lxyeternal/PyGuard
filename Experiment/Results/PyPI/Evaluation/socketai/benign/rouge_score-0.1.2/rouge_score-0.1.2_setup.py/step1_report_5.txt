{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'rouge_score' Python package, used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads package dependencies from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written or transmitted outside the script.",
  "flows": "Reads external files for description and dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py packaging pattern with no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading a markdown file for long description and defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no signs of code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious activities. The dependencies listed are common Python packages and do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for an open-source Python package with no signs of malicious behavior. It follows standard packaging procedures with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
