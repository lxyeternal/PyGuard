  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'rouge_score' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; hardcoded package metadata and dependencies in setup()",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs",
  "flows": "Reading local file -> defining setup() parameters with static data -> executing setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local 'README.md' file to obtain long description content, then defines package setup parameters including name, version, author info, description, URL, packages, classifiers, dependencies, and Python version requirements. The code relies solely on static, predefined data and standard library modules. No external inputs, user data, or untrusted data sources are processed. The dependencies are standard open-source packages without suspicious versions or origins. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely configures package metadata and dependencies safely.",
