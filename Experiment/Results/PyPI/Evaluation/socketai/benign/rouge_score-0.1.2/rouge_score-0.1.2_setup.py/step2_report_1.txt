  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence for malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard `setup.py` script for the `rouge_score` package.\n- The code reads a local `README.md` file and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are reported or observed.\n- The dependencies are common open-source packages (`absl-py`, `nltk`, `numpy`, `six`) with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with no errors or anomalies.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n- **Security risks:** No vulnerabilities, untrusted data handling, or risky behaviors.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions.\n- The code is a typical `setup.py` script with no signs of security issues.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk detected.\n\n**Overall assessment:** The package setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical, safe `setup.py` script.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.",
