  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'rouge_score' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static data in setup() call for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no network or sensitive data access observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration with no dynamic or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that reads a README file and configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers using setuptools. There are no signs of code injection, malicious payloads, or obfuscated logic. No external data or untrusted input is processed at runtime. The dependencies are well-known and commonly used open-source packages. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
