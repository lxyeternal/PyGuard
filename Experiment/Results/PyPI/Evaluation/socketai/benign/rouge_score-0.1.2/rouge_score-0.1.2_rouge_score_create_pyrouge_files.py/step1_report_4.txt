  "purpose": "To generate text files from target and prediction datasets for evaluation with pyrouge, supporting comparison of scoring metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads data from files 'target_large.txt' and 'prediction_large.txt' in the specified test data directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed text data into multiple files in the specified output directory, with filenames based on prefixes and indices.",
  "flows": "Reads data from input files -> processes data (reads into memory) -> writes data into multiple output files with controlled naming conventions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code structure is straightforward, primarily file I/O operations. The presence of an inner function 'write_files2' with a comment '# Delete this block' suggests leftover or debugging code, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines flags for input/output paths, and processes two specific input files to produce multiple output files in a specified directory. No data is sent over networks, no code injection or obfuscation, and no sensitive data is handled insecurely. The 'write_files2' function appears redundant and is marked with a comment indicating it should be removed, which might be an artifact of development but not malicious. No signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file processing script intended for preparing datasets for evaluation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, no evidence of obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only notable aspect is a commented-out or obsolete code block, likely for debugging or development, which does not impact security.",
