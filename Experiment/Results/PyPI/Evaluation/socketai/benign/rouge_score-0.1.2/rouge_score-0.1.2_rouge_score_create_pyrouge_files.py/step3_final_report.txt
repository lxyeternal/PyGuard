  "purpose": "Utility script for reading target and prediction text files and generating individual and batch output files for evaluation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'target_large.txt' and 'prediction_large.txt' in the specified test data directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes output files to the specified output directory; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads lines from input files; writes each line to individual files; additionally writes grouped files with four lines each.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment '# Delete this block' indicating auxiliary or leftover code; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O operations for data preparation. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The auxiliary function marked with a comment does not introduce security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script. The only minor concern is the residual comment, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The auxiliary code is likely leftover or for debugging purposes. Overall, the code is safe, and the reported scores are appropriate.",
