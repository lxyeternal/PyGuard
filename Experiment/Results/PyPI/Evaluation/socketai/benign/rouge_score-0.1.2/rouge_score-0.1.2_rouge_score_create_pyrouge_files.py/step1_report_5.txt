{
  "purpose": "The script generates text files from target and prediction data for use with the pyrouge evaluation tool, primarily for scoring and comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from files 'target_large.txt' and 'prediction_large.txt' located in a specified directory provided via command-line flags.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output files to a specified output directory, creating individual text files for each line or block of lines.",
  "flows": "Input files are read line-by-line; data flows from these input files through in-memory variables, then into multiple output files generated by write_files and write_files2 functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward file I/O operations with no network activity or system modification commands. The write_files2 function writes four lines per file but is an ordinary pattern without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines command-line flags for input and output directories. It reads two specific input files and writes their content into multiple output files with a defined naming pattern. The write_files function creates one file per line, while write_files2 creates multiple lines per file (4 lines per file) for the 'multi' variants. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. No network activity, encryption, or suspicious function calls are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex logic indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for preparing text data files for evaluation, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs standard file I/O operations as intended, with no evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
