  "purpose": "The script generates text files from target and prediction data for evaluation with the pyrouge tool, organizing outputs in a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files 'target_large.txt' and 'prediction_large.txt' in a specified directory (FLAGS.testdata_dir).",
  "sinks": "Writes output files in the directory specified by FLAGS.output, including individual text files and batch files with multiple lines.",
  "flows": "Reads data from input files -> Processes and writes individual text files -> Processes and writes batch text files with multiple lines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code structure and comments are straightforward; no obfuscated or unusual logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python file operations to read input data and write output files, following predictable patterns. It defines two functions for file writing: one writes one line per file, and another writes four lines per file, but both are used intentionally for organizing data. There are no network operations, no use of environment variables for sensitive data, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a typical utility script with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for preparing evaluation files for the pyrouge tool. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. Overall, the script is safe and straightforward.",
