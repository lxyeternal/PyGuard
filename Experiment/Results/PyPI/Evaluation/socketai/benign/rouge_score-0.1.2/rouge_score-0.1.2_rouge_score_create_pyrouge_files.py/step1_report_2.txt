{
  "purpose": "The script creates text files from specified target and prediction datasets for use with the pyrouge evaluation tool.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files 'target_large.txt' and 'prediction_large.txt' in a user-specified directory via command-line flags.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed data into multiple output text files in a specified output directory, based on a naming pattern.",
  "flows": "Reads data from input files -> processes data -> writes individual text files; also creates multiple files from the input data in blocks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code performs straightforward file I/O operations without hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code reads target and prediction data from user-specified directory paths, then writes each line to individual files with structured naming conventions. The function 'write_files' creates one file per line, while 'write_files2' groups four lines per file. No data is transmitted externally, no use of environment variables beyond standard flags, and no dynamic code execution occurs. The code is simple, intended for data preparation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for preparing evaluation files, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It strictly performs file reading and writing operations for a known purpose.",
