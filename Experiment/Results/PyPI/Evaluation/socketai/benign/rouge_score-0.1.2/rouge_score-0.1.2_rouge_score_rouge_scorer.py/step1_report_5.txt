{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Rouge scoring mechanism for evaluating text summarization quality, supporting various Rouge metrics such as ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, with optional stemming and sentence-level processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input text data through function parameters (target, prediction), and tokenizes text using a tokenizer object. No external untrusted input sources are directly read from the environment or files within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that transmit untrusted data over the network or to external systems are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input texts are tokenized and processed locally; scoring functions perform calculations based on tokenized data. There are no external data flow paths or untrusted data leaks identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Rouge scoring with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No use of obfuscated language features or unusual code patterns. The import statements and logic are straightforward, serving a common purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Rouge scorer class with methods for calculating various Rouge metrics, utilizing tokenization, n-gram creation, and Longest Common Subsequence calculations. All operations are contained within computational functions that process provided text data. No external data sources or sinks, or potentially malicious operations, are present. The logic is consistent with standard Rouge evaluation algorithms and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of Rouge evaluation metrics for text summarization assessment, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It operates purely as a scoring tool without external dependencies beyond standard libraries and performs no suspicious actions.",
