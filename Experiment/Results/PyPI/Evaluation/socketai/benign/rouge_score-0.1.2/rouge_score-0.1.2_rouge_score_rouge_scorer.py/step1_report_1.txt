{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Rouge score calculator for evaluating text summarization quality, supporting multiple Rouge types and tokenization options.",
  "sources": "Reads input text data from function parameters (target, prediction, targets), uses nltk for sentence tokenization, and tokenizers for text tokenization.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that handle untrusted or external data in a malicious way. No network, file, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Text input flows from function parameters to tokenization, then to scoring functions for similarity calculation. No external data flows or system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily performs text processing and scoring with standard libraries and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for calculating ROUGE metrics using tokenization, LCS, n-gram overlap, and sentence-level scoring. It employs standard libraries such as nltk, numpy, and six, with typical programming constructs. No malicious or suspicious operations are evident, such as network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of text evaluation metrics. Usage of nltk for sentence tokenization and collection libraries is standard. There are no indications of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of ROUGE scoring metrics for text summarization evaluation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and focused solely on text processing and scoring.",
