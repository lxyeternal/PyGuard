  "purpose": "Compute ROUGE scores between two text blobs for NLP evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input texts (target and prediction), tokenization process, n-gram creation, LCS computation.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data leaks, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input texts -> tokenization -> n-gram or LCS calculation -> scoring outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Minor bug in '_backtrack_norec' where variable 't' is used without being passed as an argument; this is a coding mistake, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ROUGE scoring functions using common NLP libraries. No network or system interactions are present. The only anomaly is a minor bug in a helper function, which does not impact security. The code's structure and dependencies are typical for NLP evaluation tools. No suspicious or malicious code detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Given the absence of malicious payloads, external threats, or obfuscation, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of ROUGE metrics with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor bug is a coding error, not malicious. The security risk is effectively zero. The scores should be updated to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 for consistency and accuracy.",
