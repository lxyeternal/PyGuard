{
  "purpose": "A library for tokenizing text, converting to lowercase, removing non-alphanumeric characters, and optionally stemming tokens.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' (text blob to tokenize), and 'stemmer' (optional stemmer object).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no output or data leaks are directly present. No network, file, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through lowercasing, regex substitution, splitting, optional stemming, and filtering for valid tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of regex and stemmer appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs text normalization by lowercasing and regex-based replacement of non-alphanumeric characters. It splits the text into tokens and applies optional stemming for tokens longer than 3 characters. Final filtering ensures only valid tokens (matching '^[a-z0-9]+$') are retained. All operations are standard string processing; no code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code relies on 'six' for compatibility and optionally uses a stemmer, but no insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward text tokenization library with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility function for natural language processing.",
