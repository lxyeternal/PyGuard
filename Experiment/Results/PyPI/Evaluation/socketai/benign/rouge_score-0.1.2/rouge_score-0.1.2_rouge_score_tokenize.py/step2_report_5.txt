  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward tokenization utility.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are mentioned.\n- The code uses standard regex and string processing techniques.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or sensitive data handling are present.\n- The use of 'six' ensures compatibility across Python versions.\n- The optional stemmer is a typical pattern in NLP preprocessing.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The logic is consistent, and the operations are standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Scores:**\n- The malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the reports.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The report's assessments are accurate.\n- The code is a standard, safe tokenization utility with no security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nAll scores are reasonable and justified based on the provided analysis. The code is benign and performs as intended without security concerns.",
