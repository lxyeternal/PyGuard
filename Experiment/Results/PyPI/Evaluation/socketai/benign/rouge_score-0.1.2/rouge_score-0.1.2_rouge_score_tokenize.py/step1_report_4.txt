{
  "purpose": "A library for tokenizing text, including lowercasing, cleaning, and optional stemming.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' for the text to tokenize; optional 'stemmer' object for stemming.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written to external sources or network; no untrusted data is exposed externally.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is processed through regex substitutions and splitting; optional stemming occurs on tokens > 3 characters; tokens are filtered to valid patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no hidden functions, and no unsafe operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard text preprocessing: lowercasing, regex-based cleaning, token splitting, optional stemming, and token validation. It uses safe operations and well-established Python libraries. No external data, network connections, or sensitive data handling observed. No signs of malicious intent or code injection. The code appears clean, straightforward, and intended solely for text tokenization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard text tokenization utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical processing steps safely and effectively, with no suspicious anomalies.",
