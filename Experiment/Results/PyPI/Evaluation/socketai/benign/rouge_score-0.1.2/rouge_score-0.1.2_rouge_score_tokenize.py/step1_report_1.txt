{
  "purpose": "A library for tokenizing text, including normalization, splitting, and optional stemming.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' for the text to tokenize, 'stemmer' parameter for optional stemming.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or network calls.",
  "flows": "Text is processed through normalization, splitting, optional stemming, and filtering, all within local memory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code performs standard tokenization operations without unusual patterns or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward tokenization utility: it lowers case, replaces non-alphanumeric characters with spaces, splits on whitespace, optionally stems tokens longer than 3 characters, and filters valid tokens. No external data or network operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The regular expressions and processing steps are typical for text processing tasks. The code appears benign and consistent with its described purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard tokenization library with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified.",
