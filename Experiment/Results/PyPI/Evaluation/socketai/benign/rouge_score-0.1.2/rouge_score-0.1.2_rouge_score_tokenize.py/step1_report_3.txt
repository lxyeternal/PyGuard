{
  "purpose": "A library for tokenizing text, primarily to prepare text data for natural language processing tasks such as ROUGE score calculation.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' provided to the 'tokenize' function; the 'stemmer' parameter (optional) used for stemming tokens.",
  "sinks": "The function processes 'text' but does not output or transmit data externally; no network, file, or system command interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is converted to lowercase, non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with spaces, and then tokens are split by whitespace; optionally, tokens are stemmed; finally, invalid tokens are filtered out.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code employs standard regex operations and string manipulations typical of tokenization routines. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns and compiles them for efficiency. It processes input text by normalizing case, replacing non-alphanumeric characters with spaces, splitting into tokens, optionally stemming longer tokens, and filtering valid tokens. The use of 'six.ensure_str' ensures compatibility across Python 2 and 3. There are no network calls, file I/O, or system commands. The logic appears straightforward and standard for text tokenization. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard tokenization library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical text preprocessing steps and utilizes external stemmer if provided, with no malicious or anomalous patterns detected.",
