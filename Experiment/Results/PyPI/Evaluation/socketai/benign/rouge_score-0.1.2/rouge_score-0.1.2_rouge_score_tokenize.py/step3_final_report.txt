  "purpose": "A library for tokenizing text by lowercasing, replacing non-alphanumeric characters, splitting, optionally stemming, and filtering tokens.",
  "sources": "Input text to be tokenized, stemmer object if provided",
  "sinks": "Filtered list of tokens; no external data sinks or network interactions",
  "flows": "Input text -> normalization (lowercase, regex replacements) -> splitting -> optional stemming -> filtering -> output tokens",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard text normalization and tokenization with optional stemming. It uses regex for replacements, splits on whitespace, and filters tokens matching '^[a-z0-9]+$'. No external calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The stemmer is optional and assumed safe. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are identified. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common NLP preprocessing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard tokenization utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis and scores are consistent; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. No modifications are necessary.",
