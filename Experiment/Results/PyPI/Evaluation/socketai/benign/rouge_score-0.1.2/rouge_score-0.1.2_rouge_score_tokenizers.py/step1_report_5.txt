  "purpose": "Define a framework for tokenizers used in RougeScorer, allowing customization with stemming.",
  "sources": "Importing nltk.stem.porter and rouge_score.tokenize; usage of self._stemmer in tokenize method.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenize.tokenize() with optional stemmer -> tokenized output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract Tokenizer class and a DefaultTokenizer implementation that optionally uses a Porter stemmer. It imports standard libraries and a known third-party package (nltk). The tokenize method simply delegates to rouge_score.tokenize with the optional stemmer. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that process external data insecurely, and no flow paths that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The use of well-known libraries and straightforward logic indicates no malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard tokenizer framework with no signs of tampering or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a tokenizer framework with optional stemming. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for text tokenization purposes.",
