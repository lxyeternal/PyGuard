  "purpose": "Provides tokenizer classes for NLP processing, with optional stemming, delegating tokenization to an external library.",
  "sources": "Input text parameter in tokenize() method",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenize() -> rouge_score.tokenize.tokenize with optional stemmer",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract Tokenizer class and a DefaultTokenizer that optionally uses nltk's PorterStemmer. It delegates tokenization to an external function, which is standard practice. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. External libraries are reputable, and the code structure is clear. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are detected. The use of optional stemming does not introduce security risks. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a tokenizer interface for NLP tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a tokenizer with optional stemming, relying on reputable external libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
