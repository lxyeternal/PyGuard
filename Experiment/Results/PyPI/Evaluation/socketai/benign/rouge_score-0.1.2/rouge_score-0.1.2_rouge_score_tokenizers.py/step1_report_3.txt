{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract tokenizer class and a default implementation for tokenizing text, with optional stemming.",
  "sources": "Import statements for nltk.stem.porter and rouge_score.tokenize; usage of class constructors and methods.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input, as the code primarily defines classes and methods without executing external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for tokenization and a concrete implementation that uses whitespace tokenization and optional stemming. The use of standard libraries (nltk and rouge_score) is typical for text processing tasks. No data is read from external sources or written to external locations within this code segment. No malicious behavior such as network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration is present. The code appears safe and intended for normal NLP preprocessing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of text tokenization with optional stemming, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
