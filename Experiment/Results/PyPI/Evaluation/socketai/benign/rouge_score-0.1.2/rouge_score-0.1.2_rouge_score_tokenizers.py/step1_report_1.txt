{
  "purpose": "Provide tokenizer classes for text processing in the rouge_score library, including optional stemming functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from nltk.stem and rouge_score.tokenize modules, and class initializations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval-like functions.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of DefaultTokenizer with use_stemmer argument; call to tokenize() method on text data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard use of abstract base class, optional stemmer usage, and delegation to third-party tokenizer.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract Tokenizer class and a concrete DefaultTokenizer class that optionally uses a Porter stemmer from nltk. The tokenize method delegates to rouge_score.tokenize.tokenize, passing text and optional stemmer. No user input is directly read; no data leaks or malicious code are present. Usage of external libraries is standard, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of tokenizer classes for NLP tasks. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on well-known open-source libraries without any suspicious modifications.",
