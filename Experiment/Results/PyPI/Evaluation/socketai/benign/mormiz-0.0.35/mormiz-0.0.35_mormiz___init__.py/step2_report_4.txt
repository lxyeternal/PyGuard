  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .core import Mormiz\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a simple import statement, importing `Mormiz` from a local module `.core`.  \n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- No data flows, sinks, or external interactions are present.  \n- The code is minimal and typical for modular Python projects.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Review the logic, reasoning, and summary in each report**\n\n- All reports agree that this is a straightforward import statement with no malicious activity or security concerns.  \n- They correctly identify the absence of data flows, sinks, anomalies, or obfuscation.  \n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no risk. Given the code's simplicity, a score of 0.1 might be slightly generous but acceptable considering potential context, though unlikely necessary.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any higher risk scores**\n\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, higher scores are unwarranted.  \n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign because it's a simple import.  \n- Without additional context (e.g., what `Mormiz` does), we cannot infer malicious intent.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is benign.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- All reports are consistent in their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports and appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the code.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.1; given the simplicity and lack of context, I would set it at **0** for a more conservative estimate.\n\n### Overall Recommendation\n\n- The code snippet is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk indicators.  \n- The current scores are reasonable, though I would suggest a risk score of **0** to reflect the absence of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best practices for assessing such minimal import statements.",
