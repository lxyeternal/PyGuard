{
  "purpose": "Assessment of a simple relative import statement in a Python package to determine malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .core import Mormiz' as the source of data or code execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include execution of imported code or data handling, but none are present here.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths; the import is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with no dynamic execution, external communication, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated code. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the minimal threat. The assessments are consistent and based solely on the code snippet, with no unwarranted assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
