  "purpose": "Import the Mormiz class or function from the core module within the same package",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module .core",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication detected",
  "flows": "No data flows; only an import statement is present",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which imports 'Mormiz' from a local module named 'core'. There are no additional operations, data handling, or external communications. As such, it neither introduces security risks nor contains malicious behavior. The simplicity indicates it's a typical import statement in a package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard Python code used to include components from a local module.",
