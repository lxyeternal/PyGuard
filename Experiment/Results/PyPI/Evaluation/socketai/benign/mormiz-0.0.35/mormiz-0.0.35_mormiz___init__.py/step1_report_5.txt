  "purpose": "Import the Mormiz class or function from a local core module, likely for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.core)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or output operations present",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code or objects from .core module into current namespace",
  "anomalies": "Single line, simple import statement; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol named Mormiz from a local module named core within the same package. It does not include any user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import itself is straightforward and typical in modular Python code. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The minimal code suggests it's part of a larger, non-malicious codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a routine component of a larger codebase, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
