  "purpose": "Import the Mormiz class or function from the local core module, likely for use within the current package or script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.core' and imports 'Mormiz'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is a simple import statement with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard relative import of 'Mormiz' from a module named 'core' within the same package. It contains no external input handling, no data processing, no network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior. The simplicity indicates it is likely part of a larger, legitimate codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious patterns and poses no security risk by itself.",
