  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .core import Mormiz\n```\n\n**Overall assessment of the code snippet:**\n- It's a straightforward relative import of `Mormiz` from a local module `core`.\n- There are no data flows, external communications, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The code is minimal and typical for modular Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies the import as standard, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable given the simplicity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the assessment is sound.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward import, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Correctly notes the minimal nature; no malicious indicators.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous; standard import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — correct.\n- **Conclusion:** No concern.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Same as others; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscated at 0. The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal nature of the code.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?**  \n  No. The scores align with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n- **Any assumptions that should be challenged?**  \n  Since the code snippet is just an import statement, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The reports correctly avoid assumptions beyond the visible code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, just reflecting that it's part of a larger codebase; no immediate security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. No changes are necessary. The scores appropriately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's simplicity.",
