  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from .core import Mormiz`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior in this snippet.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only performs a straightforward import with no data flow, external communication, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious or risky behavior that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The minimal nature of the code supports low risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on factual observations; no unwarranted assumptions are present.\n   - The reports avoid speculative statements about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, just a standard import statement)\n\n### Summary:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the current understanding that this code snippet is a standard, non-malicious import statement with no security concerns.",
