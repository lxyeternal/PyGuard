{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a wrapper around a tokenizer model, providing encode and decode functions for text processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads a file named \"tokenizer\" during initialization via mormiz.load_from_file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or resources.",
  "flows": "The input text flows from method parameters into the encode/decode functions; the tokenizer object is loaded from a file at startup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The 'load_from_file' method uses a hardcoded filename \"tokenizer,\" which could be a concern if it contains sensitive data, but on its own, this is common for loading models.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'mormiz' and creates a class 'Mormiz' that loads a tokenizer object from a file named \"tokenizer\". The class provides methods to encode and decode text using this tokenizer. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The filename is hardcoded but not inherently malicious. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for a tokenizer wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple tokenizer wrapper with no suspicious activity. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The use of a hardcoded filename for loading the tokenizer is common and not indicative of malicious behavior.",
