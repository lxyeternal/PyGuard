{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class that loads a tokenizer model from an external source and provides encoding and decoding methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'tokenizer' data file during initialization via mormiz.load_from_file().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; methods return processed data but do not send data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves loading 'tokenizer' from a file, then encoding or decoding text inputs using the loaded model.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. The external dependency 'mormiz' is imported, but usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'mormiz' and loads a tokenizer model from a file named 'tokenizer'. It defines methods for encoding and decoding text using this model. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and intended for normal tokenization tasks. However, reliance on external 'mormiz' library and the file 'tokenizer' may pose security considerations if those sources are compromised, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a tokenizer wrapper with no evident malicious intent. It could pose security risks if the 'mormiz' library or 'tokenizer' file are malicious or compromised, but the code itself is benign.",
