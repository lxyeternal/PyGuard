{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around the 'mormiz' library for loading a tokenizer and encoding/decoding text.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a file named 'tokenizer' during the initialization of the Mormiz class.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is sent or where user input directly influences external actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'tokenizer' file into the 'load_from_file' method, then through encode and decode methods on the 'bpe' object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of 'load_from_file' appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'mormiz' and creates a class that loads a tokenizer from a file named 'tokenizer'. It then provides encode and decode methods that utilize this tokenizer object. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity. The use of a local file 'tokenizer' is typical for such applications and does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is simple and standard, with no unusual constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard wrapper around a tokenizer library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It reads a tokenizer configuration from a file and provides encoding/decoding functions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
