{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for encoding and decoding text using a tokenizer loaded from a file.",
  "sources": "The code reads a file named 'tokenizer' during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly process untrusted input or output data; the encode and decode functions process data passed to them, but no external untrusted data sources are shown.",
  "flows": "The tokenizer is loaded from a file, then its encode and decode methods are called on input data.",
  "anomalies": "The 'load_from_file' method is called with a static filename 'tokenizer'. No evidence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'mormiz' and uses it to load a tokenizer object from a file named 'tokenizer'. It then provides methods to encode and decode text using this tokenizer. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The filename is static and appears to be a simple resource load. The structure is straightforward, and no suspicious logic or anomalies are present. As this relies on an external library 'mormiz', which is not evaluated here, there is an assumption that 'mormiz.load_from_file' is a legitimate method.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a simple wrapper around a tokenizer loaded from a file. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet.",
