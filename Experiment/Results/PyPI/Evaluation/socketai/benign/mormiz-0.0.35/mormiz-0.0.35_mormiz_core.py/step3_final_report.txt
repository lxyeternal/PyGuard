{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class that loads a tokenizer from a static file 'tokenizer' using the 'mormiz' module, providing encode and decode methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'tokenizer' file via 'mormiz.load_from_file' during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or output; potential concern is the external 'tokenizer' file and 'mormiz' module loading.",
  "flows": "External 'tokenizer' file is loaded during __init__, then encode/decode methods delegate to the loaded object; no untrusted data flows into or out of these methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; reliance on external data without validation is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around a tokenizer loaded from a file, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the external 'tokenizer' file and 'mormiz' module, which could be compromised, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to unverified external data loading. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a simple wrapper around an external tokenizer. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external 'tokenizer' file and 'mormiz' module, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior.",
