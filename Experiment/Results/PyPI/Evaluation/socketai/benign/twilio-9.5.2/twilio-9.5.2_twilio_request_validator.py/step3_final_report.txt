  "purpose": "Implements request validation for Twilio webhooks, including signature verification, URI normalization, and optional body hash validation to ensure request authenticity.",
  "sources": "URI string, request parameters (params), and request body (body).",
  "sinks": "Signature comparison functions, hash computation, and validation logic that determine request legitimacy.",
  "flows": "URI and params are used to compute signatures; the computed signatures are compared to the provided signature to validate authenticity; body hash is computed and compared if applicable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The compare function mitigates timing attacks, and cryptographic practices are standard, though SHA1 is used for signature hashing, which is weaker but aligned with Twilio's current practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard, correct request validation for Twilio webhooks, utilizing HMAC with SHA1, URI normalization, and body hash validation. It supports multiple parameter types and mitigates timing attacks with a constant-time compare. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure practices are evident. The cryptographic methods are appropriate for the context, and the logic aligns with Twilio's documentation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign and secure nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-implemented request validation utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The cryptographic practices are standard, and the logic is sound. The assigned scores are justified, and the overall security posture is low. No modifications are necessary.",
