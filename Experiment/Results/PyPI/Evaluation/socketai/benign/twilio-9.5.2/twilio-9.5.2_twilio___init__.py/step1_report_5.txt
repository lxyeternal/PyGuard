  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package by concatenating version number components.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version tuple __version_info__.",
  "sinks": "Join operation to create __version__ string.",
  "flows": "From __version_info__ to __version__ via join operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version string creation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a tuple __version_info__ with version parts and then joins these parts into a version string __version__. There are no inputs from external sources, no processing of untrusted data, no code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard way of defining version info.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a normal and benign way to define version information in a Python package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
