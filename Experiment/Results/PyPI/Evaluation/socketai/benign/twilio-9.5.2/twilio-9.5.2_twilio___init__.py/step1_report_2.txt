{
  "purpose": "Define the version information of the module as a tuple and a string",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains variable assignments and string operations",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward assignment and string join",
  "analysis": "The code sets a tuple __version_info__ with version parts and then joins these parts into a string __version__. There are no inputs, no external data processing, no security-sensitive operations, and no suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard way of defining version information in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version string definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
