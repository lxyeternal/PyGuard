  "purpose": "Define the package version information by combining version components into a string.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version components ('__version_info__') and the string join operation to create '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or security effects; simple string manipulation.",
  "flows": "Assignment from tuple to variable, then joining tuple elements into a string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple '__version_info__' with version parts '9', '5', '2', then joins these parts with periods to create the '__version__' string. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data sources involved. The code performs a straightforward operation common in version management. No malicious or suspicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard method for defining package version information. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
