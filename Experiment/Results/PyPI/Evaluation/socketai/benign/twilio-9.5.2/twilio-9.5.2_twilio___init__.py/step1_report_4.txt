  "purpose": "Define package version information by constructing a version string from a tuple.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version_info__, tuple containing version parts.",
  "sinks": "Joining the tuple elements into a string assigned to __version__.",
  "flows": "Reading __version_info__ (source) and joining its elements to create __version__ (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; straightforward version string construction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tuple __version_info__ with version components, then joins these components into a string assigned to __version__. The process is a simple data assignment and string concatenation, with no user input, network communication, or data leakage observed. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version string definition with no malicious or security concerns.",
