  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using a tuple and string join.",
  "sources": "Tuple assignment of version components (__version_info__); String join operation to create __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or output data externally.",
  "flows": "Tuple assignment -> String join to form version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard version string construction with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple of version components and joins them into a string. It involves no external input, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. High confidence (1) is justified due to the code's clarity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for defining version strings in Python packages. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
