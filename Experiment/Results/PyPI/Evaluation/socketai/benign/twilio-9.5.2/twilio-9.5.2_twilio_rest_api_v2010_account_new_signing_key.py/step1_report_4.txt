{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper for managing Twilio Signing Keys via the Twilio API, allowing creation and listing of signing keys.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters like 'friendly_name' for resource creation, and constructs API request headers and payloads. It also accesses the 'version' and 'account_sid' variables for API interactions.",
  "sinks": "The code sends HTTP POST requests to the Twilio API endpoint to create new signing keys. It uses headers for content type and accept headers, and includes data payloads with user-provided 'friendly_name'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('friendly_name') flow into data payloads; these are then sent via HTTP POST requests with appropriate headers to Twilio API endpoints, resulting in creation of signing keys.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or secrets; it uses external variables and standard API request patterns. No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. No code injection or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated API wrapper for Twilio's Signing Keys management. It constructs API requests with provided parameters and sends them over HTTP. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors are detected. The secret field is only returned upon creation, which is standard. No anomalous data handling, obfuscated code, or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation for Twilio's Signing Keys functionality. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe and intended for legitimate API interactions.",
