{
  "purpose": "This code manages Twilio signing keys via API interactions, allowing creation and representation of signing key resources.",
  "sources": "Data is read from API responses (payloads) during object initialization and from user input when creating new keys.",
  "sinks": "API requests send data (friendly name) via HTTP POST; sensitive data like 'secret' is only returned upon creation, not stored or transmitted insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data (friendly name) flows into API request payloads; responses (including 'secret') flow back into object attributes; no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The 'secret' attribute is only returned upon creation, which is standard behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated, follows standard API client patterns, and handles sensitive data appropriately. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The data flow is typical for such API wrappers, with no signs of sabotage. The 'secret' is only exposed during creation, aligning with API design. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the handling of sensitive data but not indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated API client for Twilio signing key management. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, primarily due to the exposure of secrets during creation, which is standard. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
