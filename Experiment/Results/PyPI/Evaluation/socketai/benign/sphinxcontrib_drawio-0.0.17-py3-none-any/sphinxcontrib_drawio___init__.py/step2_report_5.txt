  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard subprocess usage, environment variables handled appropriately.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, justified by the external process invocation, but no evident malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard subprocess calls, environment management, and no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by external process execution.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the external subprocess execution, environment handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified, given the external command execution.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-reasoned; the code is a legitimate extension.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Highlights subprocess execution, environment variable management, and no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent with external process calls.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern — external subprocess calls, environment variables, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Low (0.1–0.2), justified by external process execution but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the code's functionality, external process invocation, and the lack of obfuscation or malicious behavior, I would concur with the provided scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher than the highest in the reports (say, 0.2), due to external process execution, but still low.\n\n**Additional note:** The code's main potential security concern is trusting the external draw.io binary. If compromised, it could execute malicious code, but this is a standard external dependency risk rather than a code issue.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports' evaluations are accurate and reasonable. No further adjustments are necessary.",
