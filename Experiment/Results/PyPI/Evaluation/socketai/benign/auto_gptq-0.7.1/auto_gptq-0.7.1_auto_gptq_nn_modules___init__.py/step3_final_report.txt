  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data input points, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, system commands, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, network calls, or dynamic execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, unusual variable names.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify benign code with no malicious activity. Reports 1 and 2 show high confidence and low risk, aligning with their conclusions. Report 3 notes obfuscation and dynamic features with moderate confidence; given no evidence of malicious payloads, malware score remains at 0, but a slight suspicion is acknowledged. Reports 4 and 5 lack code and appropriately reflect minimal risk and confidence. The scores across reports are generally consistent with their descriptions. Slightly increasing malware score in Report 3 to 0.2 could better reflect the obfuscation concern, but current scores are acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The overall security assessment indicates minimal risk with no confirmed malicious activity. Obfuscation and dynamic features are noted but do not substantiate malicious intent. Slight adjustments to malware score in Report 3 to 0.2 are recommended to better reflect potential red flags, while keeping other scores appropriate.",
