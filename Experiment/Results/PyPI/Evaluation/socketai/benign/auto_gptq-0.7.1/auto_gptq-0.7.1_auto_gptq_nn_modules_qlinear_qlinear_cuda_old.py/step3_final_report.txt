  "purpose": "Implementation of a quantized linear layer supporting 2, 3, 4, and 8 bits with optional CUDA acceleration for efficient neural network inference.",
  "sources": "Model weights, biases, CUDA extension modules, input tensors.",
  "sinks": "Tensor computations within the forward pass; no external data leaks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Input tensor flows into quantization and matrix multiplication routines, with weight packing and bitwise operations acting as intermediate steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; complex bitwise operations are standard for quantization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard quantization weight packing, uses conditional CUDA acceleration, and executes matrix multiplication with support for multiple bit-widths. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The complex bitwise manipulations are typical for quantization schemes, and the optional CUDA modules are performance optimizations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a quantized neural network layer with CUDA support. It contains no malicious, backdoor, or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score (around 0.15) and malware score of 0 are justified based on the analysis.",
