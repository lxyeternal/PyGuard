  "purpose": "This script configures the environment, checks dependencies, and compiles CUDA/ROCm extensions for a Python package, primarily for building and setup purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'PYPI_RELEASE', 'CUDA_VERSION', 'ROCM_VERSION'), subprocess commands for system info and kernel generation, import statements for dependencies like torch and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() calls upon environment mismatches, subprocess outputs influencing build steps, environment variables controlling build logic.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence conditional logic; subprocess outputs (e.g., CPU cores, kernel generation) guide build configuration; dependency imports and environment checks determine build path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls for static commands; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; subprocess commands are standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build and setup script for a Python package with CUDA/ROCm support. It performs environment detection, dependency checks, and extension compilation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are used for system info and code generation, which are standard in such scripts. The environment variables control build options, and the script terminates upon detecting incompatible configurations, which is normal. The use of 'shell=True' in subprocess is a minor security concern but acceptable here due to static commands. Overall, the code is straightforward and aligns with common build practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build setup for a Python package involving CUDA/ROCm extensions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
