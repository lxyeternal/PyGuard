  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for fused attention and MLP modules with injection methods for model integration.",
  "sources": "Class method parameters such as 'model', 'use_triton', 'group_size', 'use_cuda_fp16', 'desc_act', 'trainable', and other keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points in subclasses where untrusted data could influence model behavior, though none are explicitly present in this abstract code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class method inputs to subclass implementations; no runtime data processing occurs in this abstract code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard interface definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of abstract classes for fused modules, mainly defining interfaces with abstract methods. There are no executable or malicious elements. The reports are empty, providing no analysis or findings. Given the benign structure, no vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are evident. The scores should be minimal, reflecting the lack of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of abstract classes for model module injection. The reports are placeholders with no analysis, indicating no detected security issues. Therefore, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
