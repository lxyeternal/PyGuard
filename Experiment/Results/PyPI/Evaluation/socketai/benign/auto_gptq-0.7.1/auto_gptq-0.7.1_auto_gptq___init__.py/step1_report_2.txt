{
  "purpose": "Import statements for modules related to modeling, utility functions, and configuration, likely part of a larger machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .modeling, .utils.exllama_utils, .utils.peft_utils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points or sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements and a version string; no anomalies, suspicious functions, or code execution patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, which is standard in Python projects. The presence of utility functions and model configurations suggests typical library setup. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or credential handling is present. The version string is a static assignment. Overall, the code appears to be a standard part of a library or package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project.",
