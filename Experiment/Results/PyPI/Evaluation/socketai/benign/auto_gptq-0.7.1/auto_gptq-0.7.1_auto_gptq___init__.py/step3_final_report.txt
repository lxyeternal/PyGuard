  "purpose": "Module initialization and dependency import for model quantization utilities",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.modeling, .utils.exllama_utils, .utils.peft_utils), version string declaration",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements and version string",
  "flows": "Import statements and version string are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements and a version string, typical for package setup modules. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are indicated or implied. The code's static nature and absence of external interactions confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
