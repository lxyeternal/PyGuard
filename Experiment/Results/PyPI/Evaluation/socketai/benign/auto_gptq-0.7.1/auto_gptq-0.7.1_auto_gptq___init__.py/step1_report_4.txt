{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and setting version information, likely part of a larger machine learning or AI model package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.modeling, .utils.exllama_utils, .utils.peft_utils). No external input data handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable; this fragment only imports modules and sets version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious function calls or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of import statements and a version string. It does not execute any logic, handle inputs, or perform operations that could be malicious. The imported modules are from relative local paths, indicating internal package structure. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, consisting only of import statements and version declaration. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
