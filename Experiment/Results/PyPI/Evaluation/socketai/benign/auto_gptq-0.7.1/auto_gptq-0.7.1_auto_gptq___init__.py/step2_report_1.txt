  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as consisting solely of import statements from local modules and a version string declaration.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, suspicious functions, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be a standard module initialization or setup script, typical in Python packages related to machine learning model quantization and utilities.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code snippet contains only import statements and a version string. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs here.\n- **Malware and Security Risks:** Given the lack of any suspicious or malicious code, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward and un-obfuscated, so the obfuscated score is correct at 0.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities based on this code snippet; it is standard module import code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. The security risk score is also correctly 0.\n\n- **Any discrepancies or overestimations?**  \n  No. The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n- **Is there any overlooked malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (since no security risks are evident)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code provided.",
