{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific modules and functions related to machine learning model quantization and utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules: .modeling, .utils.exllama_utils, and .utils.peft_utils.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system modification present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve importing modules and functions, with no apparent data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "This code only contains import statements and a version string declaration. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or system modifications. The imported modules relate to model quantization and utility functions, which are common in machine learning workflows. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and version declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
