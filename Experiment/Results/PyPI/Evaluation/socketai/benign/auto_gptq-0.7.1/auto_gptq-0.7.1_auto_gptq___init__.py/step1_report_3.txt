  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to AI model quantization and utilities, likely used for configuring and setting up language models.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .modeling, .utils.exllama_utils, .utils.peft_utils",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or outputs; code only imports functions and sets a version variable.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical of package initialization files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from local modules, likely part of a larger package, and defines a version string. There is no execution of untrusted data, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The structure is standard for package __init__.py files, focusing on module setup and organization.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a simple module initialization with no suspicious elements.",
