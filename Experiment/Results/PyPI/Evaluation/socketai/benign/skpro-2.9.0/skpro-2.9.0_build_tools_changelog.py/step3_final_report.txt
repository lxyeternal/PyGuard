  "purpose": "Fetches pull requests, releases, compares tags, and generates a changelog and contributor list from GitHub data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for tokens, GitHub API endpoints for PRs, releases, and comparisons.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for changelog and contributor lists, exception raising for inconsistencies.",
  "flows": "API responses from GitHub are parsed and used to generate formatted output; no data exfiltration or system modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests to GitHub, uses environment variables securely for optional token authentication, and processes data for output. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward, with read-only API calls and data formatting. No suspicious URL patterns or hidden behaviors are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.1) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation for generating changelogs from GitHub data. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores and assessments across the reports are justified and accurate.",
