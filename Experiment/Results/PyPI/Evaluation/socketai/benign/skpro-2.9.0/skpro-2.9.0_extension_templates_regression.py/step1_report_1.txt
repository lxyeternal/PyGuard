{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for implementing custom probabilistic regression estimators within the skpro framework, guiding users on how to structure and document their estimators.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads are present in the code; all content is static template comments and class/method definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no code sections that write to external systems, send data over the network, or access environment variables. No data leaks or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code provides placeholders for data flow from input (X, y) to fitted model attributes, and from input features (X) to predictions, but contains no actual executable data flow or logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely a structured template with no executable logic, data handling, or dynamic code. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detectable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, commented template designed to guide users in creating new estimators following skpro standards. It includes placeholder methods (_fit, _predict, etc.) with no implementation or executable logic. All code is static, consisting solely of comments, class structure, and method signatures. There are no data reads, external calls, or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. The content strictly adheres to a template pattern, with no embedded code that could be malicious or maliciously crafted.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, purely structural template for estimator implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions that could pose security threats.",
