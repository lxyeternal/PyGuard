  "purpose": "Template for implementing new probabilistic regressors following skpro standards, including instructions, parameters, and method outlines.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of input or data reading are present; this is a template with placeholder comments for user implementation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no code writes or network communication, just placeholders for user-defined logic.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow exists; user-inserted logic will define source-to-sink data flow. Currently, no flows are implemented.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only placeholder and template code with no actual implementation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or code that could hide malicious intent is present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a structured template with extensive comments guiding the implementation of a new probabilistic regressor. It includes no actual executable logic, no data handling, and no network or system calls. The placeholder methods and comments do not contain any suspicious or malicious code; all suspicious signals are absent. The code appears to be a legitimate, instructional template intended for development purposes. Since no actual data processing or external communication occurs in the provided code, the risk of malicious activity is extremely low. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities in the template itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a template with no actual implementation, data handling, or external interactions. It presents no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to guide developers in creating new estimators within the skpro framework. Overall, the code is safe with negligible security concern.",
