  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static, purely structural template with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Assessment:** This is accurate. The code is a scaffold with comments and method signatures, no runtime logic, data flow, or external calls.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — correct, no malicious code present.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 — correct, code is transparent and unobfuscated.  \n  - Risk: 0.0 — correct, no security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a template with placeholders, no actual logic, no malicious code, and only generic imports. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a developer scaffold with no runtime logic or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, a template with no actual implementation, no data processing, no external communication, and no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.0 — correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a non-functional template with no actual logic, data flow, or external interactions. No suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, a placeholder scaffold with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.0 — correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the provided code is a static, non-executable template with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature. The obfuscation scores are zero, as expected, given the transparent, comment-based structure. The risk scores are all zero, reflecting the absence of any security concerns.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (code is clear and unobfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is a benign, purely structural template intended for development guidance, with no malicious or security-related issues.",
