{
  "purpose": "Template for developing new probabilistic regressors following skpro conventions; provides structure and guidelines for implementing estimators.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; structure expects data input during _fit and _predict methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; placeholder methods do not process untrusted data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly implemented; template provides structure for future data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code is a standard template with placeholders and no logic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-functional template designed for user implementation. It contains commented instructions, placeholder methods, and import statements meant to be filled with user-defined logic. There are no data input/output, network communications, or code execution beyond standard class and method definitions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The imports are standard and are commented to be used within methods, not at top level, which is good practice. Overall, the code is purely scaffolding without executable logic or external interactions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign template for estimator development, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It solely provides structure for user implementation. The code contains no harmful patterns or suspicious activity.",
