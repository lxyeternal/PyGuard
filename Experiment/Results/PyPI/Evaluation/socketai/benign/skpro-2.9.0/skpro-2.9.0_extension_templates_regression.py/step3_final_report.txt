{
  "purpose": "This code is a static, heavily commented template for creating custom estimators within skpro. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external calls, serving solely as a development scaffold.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or data; it only contains comments, method signatures, and placeholder instructions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as no data processing or external interactions are implemented.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is purely structural with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code does not perform any unusual or suspicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable template intended for developers to implement estimators. It includes placeholder methods, comments, and import statements, but no actual data processing, external calls, or logic. It does not read or write external data, does not perform network operations, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious code segments. Given its static and instructional nature, there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, purely structural template with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as a development scaffold for estimator implementation and is safe for use.",
