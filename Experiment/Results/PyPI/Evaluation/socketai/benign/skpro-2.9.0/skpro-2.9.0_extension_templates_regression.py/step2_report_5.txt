  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, structure, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a static, detailed template with no executable logic. It contains only comments, method signatures, and placeholder instructions.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Risk assessment:** Since there's no dynamic code, external calls, or data handling, the security risk is negligible.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. These are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** The template includes user-defined parameters, placeholders for core logic, and a generic import of `SomeDistribution`. No actual implementation or data processing.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** No signs of malicious code; import is generic and not suspicious.\n- **Risk assessment:** No external system calls, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. These are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, a purely structural template with no actual logic, data flow, or system interaction.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Risk assessment:** No malicious activity or external communication.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a scaffold with comments and placeholders, no executable code.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Risk assessment:** No external interactions or data handling.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** A standard, non-functional template with no logic, data flow, or external calls.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Risk assessment:** No security risks.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, static template with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code's clear, commented, and straightforward structure.\n- **Risk score:** All are correctly set to 0, given the absence of executable logic, external calls, or data handling that could pose security concerns.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, instructional template with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, with no executable or malicious content.",
