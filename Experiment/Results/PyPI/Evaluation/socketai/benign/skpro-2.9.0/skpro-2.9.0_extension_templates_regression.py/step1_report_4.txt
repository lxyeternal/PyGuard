  "purpose": "Template for implementing new probabilistic regressors following skpro standards; provides structure and guidelines for development.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; all data comes from function parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no code writes or network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; primarily template code with placeholders for model fitting and prediction logic.",
  "anomalies": "Contains placeholder comments, no actual data processing or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured template for estimator development, not an executable model. It contains only comments, method signatures, and import statements with placeholders. There are no actual data manipulations, network calls, or dynamic code executions. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors are present. All components are consistent with a development template and do not perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-functional template for estimator implementation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, placeholder-based template with no active logic that could be exploited. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
