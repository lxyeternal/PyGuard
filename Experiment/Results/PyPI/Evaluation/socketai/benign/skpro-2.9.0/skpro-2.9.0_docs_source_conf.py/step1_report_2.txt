  "purpose": "Configure the Sphinx documentation for the skpro project, including paths, extensions, theme, and integrations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS, READTHEDOCS_VERSION), system modules (sys, os, inspect), skpro module, and static assets.",
  "sinks": "URL constructions for source code links, version switcher JSON URL, Binder links, and GitHub/Notebook URLs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence URL generation and versioning; source code inspection for link resolution; static links for documentation navigation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is standard for a documentation configuration script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with environment-dependent URL generation, path management, and extension setup. It contains no code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior. URL constructions depend on environment variables, but all are benign and typical for documentation hosting. The inspect-based source code link resolution is standard practice. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration script for documentation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It relies on environment variables for versioning and path setup, which is common in such contexts. Overall, the script is safe and purposeful.",
