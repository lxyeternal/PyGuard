{
  "purpose": "Configuration script for setting up and customizing Sphinx documentation for the skpro project.",
  "sources": "Imports (datetime, inspect, os, sys, skpro), environment variables (READTHEDOCS, READTHEDOCS_VERSION), and file system paths for documentation generation.",
  "sinks": "URL construction in linkcode_resolve function, dynamic path modifications, environment variable usage, and external link generation.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS, READTHEDOCS_VERSION) influence path and version logic; inspect and getsourcefile functions retrieve source file info; URL construction in linkcode_resolve creates links to GitHub; static assets and external URLs are referenced for documentation rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. Use of environment variables and URL generation is standard for documentation setups.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration with extensions, environment-dependent path adjustments, and URL link functions. The linkcode_resolve function constructs source code URLs for documentation links, which is a common practice. Environment variables control versioning and paths. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage are present. The script does not perform any network activity beyond URL construction for documentation links, and all external references are related to documentation hosting.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard documentation configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It mainly manages paths, extensions, and URL generation for documentation purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
