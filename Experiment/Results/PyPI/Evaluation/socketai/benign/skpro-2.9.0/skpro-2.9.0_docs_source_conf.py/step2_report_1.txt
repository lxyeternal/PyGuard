  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and logical flaws.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard Sphinx configuration, environment variables, and source code inspection.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. URL generation is based on environment variables and source code inspection, which is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware, obfuscation, or security risks identified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies this as standard, safe configuration code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard documentation setup.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code or suspicious patterns. URL construction and environment variable usage are typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard Sphinx configuration, source code inspection, environment variables.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of `inspect` for source linking is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Full confidence (1.0), no malware or security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, with environment variables, paths, and URL generation.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. URL creation via source inspection is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1.0), no malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—configuration with environment variables, paths, and URL generation.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. All behaviors are typical for documentation setup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but still very high, no malware or risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, mostly 0.1, reflecting minimal concern, primarily due to environment variable usage and URL generation.\n\n### Final System Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, standard configuration.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, typical for configuration scripts, mostly due to environment-dependent URL generation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis code is a legitimate, standard Sphinx configuration script for the `skpro` project. It employs common practices such as environment variable checks, source code inspection for linking, and extension setup. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
