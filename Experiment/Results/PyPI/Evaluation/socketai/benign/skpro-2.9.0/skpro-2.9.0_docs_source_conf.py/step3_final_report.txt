  "purpose": "Configure skpro Sphinx documentation with environment-aware path setup, source code linking, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (READTHEDOCS, READTHEDOCS_VERSION), sys.modules, inspect module, skpro module, file paths for source linking.",
  "sinks": "URL construction for source code links on GitHub, environment-dependent version selection, sys.path modification.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence path and version decisions; inspect retrieves source files and line numbers for URL generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Usage of inspect for source linking is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Sphinx configuration tasks: setting paths based on environment, linking source code via inspect, and managing version info. No malicious activity, network activity, or obfuscation present. URL generation and environment checks follow common practices. The confidence score (0.9) is justified given the straightforward, well-understood pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate, standard configuration for Sphinx documentation in the skpro project. It employs common practices without any malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) reflects typical environment-dependent logic, which is acceptable in this context. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood.",
