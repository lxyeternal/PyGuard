  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security concerns, malware, obfuscation, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard configuration for Sphinx, using environment variables, sys.modules, and inspect.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. URL generation via inspect is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies this as benign configuration code. The URL construction is based on source inspection, which is standard. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, environment variables, modules, and static assets.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95), safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, standard Sphinx configuration. No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The URL generation and environment variable usage are typical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with environment variables, inspect, and source code linking.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity. Use of inspect for source linking is common.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Full confidence (1.0), safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a straightforward, benign documentation setup script. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuration with environment variables, sys.path modifications, inspect for source links.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0), safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nStandard practice for Sphinx source linking. No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, environment variables, URL generation, and static paths.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but still safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, typical documentation configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports have a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is purely configuration, with no network activity or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly around 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to environment variable dependencies and URL generation, which are standard)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code in all reports is a legitimate, standard Sphinx configuration script. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious backdoors. The environment-dependent URL and path manipulations are typical for documentation projects hosted on platforms like ReadTheDocs.\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
