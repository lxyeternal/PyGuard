  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\nThe provided code snippet is minimal:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"skpro.\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"2.9.0\"\n\n__all__ = [\"show_versions\"]\n\nfrom skpro.utils._maint._show_versions import show_versions\n```\n\nIt defines package metadata (`__version__`, `__all__`) and imports a function `show_versions` from an internal module. There are no user inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no apparent malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports uniformly interpret the code as benign, with consistent reasoning. No logical errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identified as package metadata and import.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, consistent and accurate.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- Same as above, straightforward and benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- Same conclusion; no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.  \n- Correctly notes no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All indicate no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk, which matches the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Are the malware scores justified?**  \n  Yes. The code contains no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Is the obfuscated score justified?**  \n  Yes. The code is clear, not obfuscated.\n\n- **Are the security risk scores justified?**  \n  Yes. No security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the code and reports, the current scoring and conclusions are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just for package setup, but effectively negligible)\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is standard package boilerplate with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minimal import and version declaration do not introduce any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain current scores and conclusions. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
