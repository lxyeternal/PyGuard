  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code and the claims.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\n\"\"\"skpro.\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"2.9.0\"\n\n__all__ = [\"show_versions\"]\n\nfrom skpro.utils._maint._show_versions import show_versions\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is minimal, defining package metadata (`__version__`, `__all__`) and importing a function (`show_versions`) from a submodule.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network activity, or other malicious patterns.\n- The import path suggests internal structure, which is typical for package setup code.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources; the code does not process user input or external data.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; straightforward package metadata and import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Same reasoning as Report 1; identical conclusion.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same as above; standard package setup code.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same analysis; no suspicious activity detected.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent with the code.  \n- The report notes the import from an internal module, which is typical, and finds no malicious patterns.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Verification of Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0, appropriate given the code content.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential for Malicious Behavior:** The code itself does not execute any untrusted data or perform suspicious actions.\n- **Package Structure:** The import path is internal but not suspicious; typical for package code.\n- **Malware or Obfuscation Claims:** None are justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be 0, as there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior present.                           |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                |\n| Security Risk    | 0                   | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior detected.                  |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with the code, and the initial assessments are accurate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be 0.**",
