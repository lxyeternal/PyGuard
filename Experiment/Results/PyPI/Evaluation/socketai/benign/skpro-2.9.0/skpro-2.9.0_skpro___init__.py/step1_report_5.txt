  "purpose": "Define the module version and export the show_versions function from the skpro.utils._maint._show_versions module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the show_versions function from an internal module 'skpro.utils._maint._show_versions'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code only sets version info and imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The import is from a seemingly internal, but not inherently malicious, module.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string, exports a function name, and imports a function from a local internal module. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. It appears to be standard module setup code without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign module initialization code that defines version info and imports a utility function. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
