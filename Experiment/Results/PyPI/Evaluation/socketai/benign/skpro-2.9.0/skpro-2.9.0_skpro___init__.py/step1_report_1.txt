{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define metadata for a Python package named 'skpro' and imports a function to show version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports a specific function from a submodule.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks; the import statement is a static import, not dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines package metadata variables and imports a function. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The import is a static module import, and no runtime data handling occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign module that sets version information and imports a function for displaying version info. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
