{
  "purpose": "To set up and expose a function show_versions from the skpro library for displaying version information.",
  "sources": "Import statement from skpro.utils._maint._show_versions",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or code execution",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines metadata",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs; only standard package metadata and import",
  "analysis": "The code defines version information and a list of exported functions. It imports a function from a submodule of skpro. There are no input handling, no execution of dynamic code, no network operations, and no suspicious patterns. The structure appears typical for a Python package module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module setup with a version string and an import statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
