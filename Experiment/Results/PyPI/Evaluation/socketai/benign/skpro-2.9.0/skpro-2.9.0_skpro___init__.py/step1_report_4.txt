  "purpose": "Export the show_versions function from the skpro.utils._maint._show_versions module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from skpro.utils._maint._show_versions import show_versions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The imported function could potentially be called elsewhere, but within this code, no flow of untrusted data is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets the package version, defines an exported function, and imports a function from a submodule. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks within this snippet. The import appears standard, and the versioning is typical for Python packages. No data handling or external communication occurs here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package module definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to define package versioning and export a function, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
