{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports a utility function show_versions from an internal module.",
  "sources": "Static import from skpro.utils._maint._show_versions; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets variables and performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup code with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining version info and exposing a function. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package module with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
