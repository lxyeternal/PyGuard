  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code snippet is minimal, defining a version string, an export list, and importing a function from an internal module.\n- There are no dynamic data flows, no user input handling, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no hardcoded credentials.\n- The import path appears to be an internal module within the package, which is common for package setup code.\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond defining metadata and importing a function, which is typical for a package's __init__.py or similar module.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1 to 5: Security and Malware Scores\n\n**Scores assigned:** All are 0, with the last one at 0.9 confidence.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — No evident vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The high confidence (1 or 0.9) is justified given the simplicity and transparency.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning issues:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- They consistently note the absence of untrusted data flows, dynamic code execution, or external communication.\n\n**Any mistakes?**  \nNo. The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential concerns or assumptions:\n\n- Some reports mention \"internal module\" or \"package setup,\" which is accurate.  \n- No report claims or hints at vulnerabilities or malicious behavior based on assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or close to zero), since the code is benign.\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern is if the internal import path is malicious or compromised, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign package module defining version info and importing a utility function. The scores assigned (all zero, with high confidence) are appropriate. No malicious or security issues are evident, and the reasoning in the reports is sound.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are; no changes necessary. The code poses no security threat based on the provided snippet.",
