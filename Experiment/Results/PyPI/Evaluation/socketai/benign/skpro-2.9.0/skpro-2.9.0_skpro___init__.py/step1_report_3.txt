  "purpose": "Expose the version of the skpro package and allow access to show_versions functionality.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__, import statement for show_versions",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; code primarily initializes variables and imports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, specifies exported symbols, and imports a function from a submodule. There is no user input handling, network activity, or sensitive data management. The import appears standard for a package setup. No malicious patterns or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, initializing package metadata and importing a utility function without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
