  "purpose": "Utility function for flattening numpy arrays, specifically handling 2D column vectors.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (`y`), which are inputs provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modification; it only processes input data locally.",
  "flows": "Input `y` is checked for shape; if it is a 2D column vector, it is flattened and returned. Otherwise, it is returned unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function to handle numpy array reshaping, specifically flattening 2D column vectors to 1D. The function checks the shape of the input array and flattens it if necessary. There are no network operations, data leaks, or obfuscated code present. Usage of numpy's flatten method is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility function for array manipulation with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
