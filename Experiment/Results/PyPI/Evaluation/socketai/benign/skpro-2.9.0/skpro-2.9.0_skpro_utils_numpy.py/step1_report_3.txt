{
  "purpose": "Utility function to flatten a numpy array to 1D if it is a 2D column vector.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'y', which is a numpy array.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a numpy array, either flattened or unchanged; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'y' is checked for its shape; if it's a 2D column vector, it's flattened; otherwise, it's returned as is.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward array shape handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function that conditionally flattens a numpy array. It only manipulates the input data to reshape it, without any external calls, network access, or suspicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The logic is standard and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic numpy array reshaping as intended, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
