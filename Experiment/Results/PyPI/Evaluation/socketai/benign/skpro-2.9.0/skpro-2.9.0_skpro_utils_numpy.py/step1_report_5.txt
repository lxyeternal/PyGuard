  "purpose": "Utility function to flatten numpy arrays to 1D, specifically handling 2D column vectors.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameter 'y', which is a numpy array.",
  "sinks": "Returns the processed numpy array 'y_flat'. No external sinks or outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'y' is checked for shape; if it is a 2D column vector, it is flattened; otherwise, it is returned unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a simple shape check on a numpy array to determine if it is a 2D column vector and flattens it accordingly. It uses standard numpy operations without external data sources or sinks. No suspicious patterns, data leakage, or malicious behavior are detected. The code appears to be a benign utility function for data preprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a benign purpose in data handling.",
