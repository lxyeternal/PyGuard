{
  "purpose": "Utility function for numpy array manipulation, specifically to flatten 2D column vectors to 1D.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or send data externally.",
  "flows": "None; the function simply processes the input array and returns a modified or unchanged version.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No unusual or potentially malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The function checks the shape of the numpy array and flattens it if it's a 2D column vector. The logic is simple and intended for data preprocessing. There are no data leaks, code injections, or malicious operations. It operates only on the input array and returns a processed version without external interactions or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a simple data shape check and flattening operation as expected in data processing workflows.",
