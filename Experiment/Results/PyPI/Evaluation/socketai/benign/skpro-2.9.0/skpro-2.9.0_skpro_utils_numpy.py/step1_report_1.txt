{
  "purpose": "Utility function for flattening numpy arrays, specifically handling 2D column vectors.",
  "sources": "The function reads input from the parameter 'y', which is a numpy array provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The function processes 'y' internally and returns a potentially modified numpy array; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'y' -> Check shape -> If 2D column vector, flatten -> Return flattened or original array.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward utility function that checks if a numpy array is a 2D column vector and flattens it to 1D if so. The function uses standard numpy operations without executing any untrusted code, external data, or network operations. There are no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility function for numpy array manipulation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
