{
  "purpose": "Template for implementing a custom survival predictor within the skpro framework, providing structure and guidance for developers to create new estimators.",
  "sources": "User-provided code comments, class constructor parameters, method arguments, and imported modules inside methods (e.g., skpro.distributions, pandas).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if predictions or internal states are improperly handled; code execution based on untrusted data is unlikely since the code primarily sets up class structure and placeholders.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data (X, y, C) into the _fit method; model parameters are set within _fit; predictions flow from _predict, _predict_proba, _predict_interval, _predict_quantiles; distribution predictions are generated in _predict_proba; prediction methods produce output based on fitted model attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code consists mainly of template comments and placeholder methods. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious imports outside standard packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured template intended for extension, with placeholder methods and detailed instructions. It contains no actual implementation logic, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. All imports are standard and only used within methods. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present. The comments and structure clearly indicate it is a non-functional scaffold, aimed at guiding development rather than executing malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign template code with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed to be extended for legitimate model development within the skpro framework. The lack of executable logic or network activity supports a conclusion of no malware or security threats.",
