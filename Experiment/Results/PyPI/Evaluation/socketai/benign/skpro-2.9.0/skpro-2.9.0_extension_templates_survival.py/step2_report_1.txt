  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a template for developing a custom survival predictor within the skpro framework.\n- It contains only method signatures, detailed comments, and placeholders for user implementation.\n- There are no actual data processing, external data handling, or system interactions.\n- The imports are minimal and standard, with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated segments, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is clearly educational/scaffolding, not functional or operational code.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation:**\n\n- All reports explicitly state that the code is a scaffold with no executable logic, data handling, or external communication.\n- No obfuscated code, no hidden behaviors, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- The import statements are standard and only used within methods, not at the module level.\n- The placeholder variables (`None`, `\"placeholder\"`, `values = None`) are typical for templates, not malicious.\n\n**Security Risk:**\n\n- The code does not perform any data leaks, network communication, or external interactions.\n- No external data sources are read, and no data is written to untrusted systems.\n- The comments and structure indicate that this is a safe, instructional scaffold.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear, structured, and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no operational logic, no data handling, no external interactions, and it is a template.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is an intentionally benign, well-documented scaffold for user extension. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.0**\n\nThis aligns with all the reports' assessments and the nature of the code.",
