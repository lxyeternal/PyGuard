{
  "purpose": "Template for developing a custom probabilistic survival regressor, intended as a guide for implementation following skpro framework standards.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; primarily reads class attributes, method parameters, and internal variables during fitting and prediction.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include placeholder methods where user-implemented logic may process data; no current code reads or writes untrusted external data or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input features (X) through fit and predict methods, but current code does not contain actual data processing logic or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual implementation; all core methods are placeholders with 'None' or 'placeholder' values, which is typical for a template. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a skeletal template guiding the development of a survival prediction estimator within the skpro framework. It includes structured method signatures, documentation, and comments for implementation, but no actual data processing, logic, or external communications are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscated code. The code is designed for safe extension by users and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a benign, intentionally blank template intended for user extension. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. Its structure is designed for guiding proper implementation of a survival predictor within a standardized framework.",
