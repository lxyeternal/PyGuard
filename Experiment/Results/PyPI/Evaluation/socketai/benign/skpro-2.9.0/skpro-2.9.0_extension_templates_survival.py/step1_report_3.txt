{
  "purpose": "Template for implementing a custom probabilistic survival regressor, guiding developers on method implementation, parameter setup, and testing.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; placeholder code for data input occurs in _fit, _predict, and prediction methods; no actual data reading code present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no code writes untrusted data to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "No actual data flows or logic implemented; placeholders for data processing and prediction steps only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual logic; placeholder variables (e.g., 'values = None') suggest incomplete implementation, but no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual constructs, or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structural template with extensive comments guiding implementation. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or third-party calls, aside from commented placeholders. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code's purpose is clearly educational and scaffolding for future development, with no active data flow or external system interaction. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident. The structure and content indicate a safe, well-documented template rather than functional code with malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable, instructional template with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for guiding the development of a survival analysis estimator, with placeholders and comments. It presents a very low malware likelihood and no security threats.",
