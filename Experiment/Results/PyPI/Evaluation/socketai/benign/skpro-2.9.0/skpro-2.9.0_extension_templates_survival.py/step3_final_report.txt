{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a scaffold template for developing custom survival predictors within the skpro framework. It provides method signatures, detailed comments, and placeholders for user implementation, without containing actual data processing or logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only through method parameters (X, y, C) during fit and predict methods; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is written or external communication occurs; the code does not perform any data leaks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, y, C) into the fit method, and from the fitted model to predictions via the predict and probabilistic methods; all are placeholders with no actual data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code contains only method signatures, comments, and placeholders with no executable or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-operational template intended for user extension, with no data handling, external interactions, or malicious patterns. It contains only standard imports, method signatures, and instructive comments. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The structure and comments suggest a benign scaffold designed for safe development within the skpro framework.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured scaffold with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as a safe template for developers to implement custom survival predictors, with no operational logic or external interactions that could pose security concerns.",
