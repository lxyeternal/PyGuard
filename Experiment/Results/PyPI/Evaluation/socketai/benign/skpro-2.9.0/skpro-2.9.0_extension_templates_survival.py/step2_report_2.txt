  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the purpose, data flow, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n**Summary of the Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a structural, instructional template for developing a custom survival predictor within the skpro framework.\n- They consistently note the absence of actual data processing, external data sources, or active logic.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified: no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- The code's purpose is purely scaffolding and guidance, with placeholders and detailed comments for user implementation.\n- The reports assign a very high confidence (1.0) that the code is benign, with zero malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code contains no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- It is a template meant for extension, not a functional or executable component.\n- No external or untrusted data is read or written; no network activity.\n- The structure and comments are standard and benign.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is that the code contains placeholders (`None`, `'placeholder'`, `values = None`) indicating incomplete implementation, but this is entirely expected for a template and not suspicious.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — given the above, no security risk is present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent in identifying this as a benign, instructional template with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — no security risk, as it is a scaffold for user implementation.\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature as a non-operational template.",
