  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Content:** Clear that this is a template for developing a survival predictor within skpro. No actual data processing, only placeholders and instructions.\n- **Data Flow & Sinks:** No real data flow, no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Malicious Indicators:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The code is purely scaffolding.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, benign, designed for user extension. No malware, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (or lower). The report's conclusion aligns with this.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that it's a standard, non-malicious template with no external interactions or suspicious code.\n- No active data flows, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a structural template with placeholders, no actual implementation logic.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: scaffold code, only method signatures, comments, and placeholders.\n- No suspicious or malicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports: a scaffold for estimator development, no active logic, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Justification:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports describe a benign, intentionally skeletal template with no actual data processing, no external data handling, and no suspicious code patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected. The code contains no obfuscated segments, no hidden code, and no malicious logic.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of these files as templates, the risk is essentially zero. The scores should reflect that.\n\n### **Recommended Scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score  | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Clear, commented, and straightforward template code.        |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No external communication, no data leaks, no harmful logic. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the content being a benign, instructional template.\n- The code's purpose is solely scaffolding for user implementation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
