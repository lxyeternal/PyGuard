{
  "purpose": "Template for implementing custom survival predictors within the skpro framework, providing structure and guidance for fitting, predicting, and testing estimators.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are explicitly used; the code includes placeholders for data input handling in methods such as _fit and prediction functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or operations that process untrusted data inputs; the code primarily defines method templates and placeholders without executing data transformations or external calls.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows or logic pathways; the code consists mainly of method signatures, comments, and placeholders for user implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard template with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. There are no hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or hidden backdoors. The import statements are minimal and standard. No dynamic code execution or external network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured template for developing survival estimators within skpro, with clearly defined method signatures and comprehensive instructions for implementation. All content consists of comments guiding user implementation, with no actual data processing or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware, are present. The lack of operational code and external calls indicates it's a benign scaffold designed for user extension.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, non-malicious template intended for user development of survival prediction models. It contains no suspicious or malicious elements, nor does it perform any data handling or network communication. It is safe and free from malware or security risks.",
