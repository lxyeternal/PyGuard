{
  "purpose": "This code is a scaffold/template for implementing probability distributions within the skpro framework. It contains placeholder methods with instructions for developers to fill in actual logic, serving as a coding pattern rather than functional code.",
  "sources": "No active data sources; parameters are passed during initialization; placeholder strings used in methods instead of real data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or external communication; placeholder functions do not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No actual data flows; methods contain placeholder strings ('do_sth_with(...)') with no real logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "All methods contain placeholder strings instead of real implementation; no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-functional template intended for developers to implement distribution logic. It contains no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The placeholder strings indicate incomplete implementation, not malicious intent. The structure is straightforward and transparent, with no external data handling or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scaffold with no active or malicious features. It poses no security threat in its current form and is intended solely as a development template.",
