{
  "purpose": "Template for implementing custom probability distributions within skpro, primarily for educational or development purposes, not a concrete class for direct use.",
  "sources": "Constants, parameters, and placeholder strings within class methods; no external or user input sources evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; placeholder functions contain strings like 'do_sth_with', indicating unimplemented internal logic, but no data flows or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow; methods are placeholders with string stubs instead of executable logic. Parameter broadcasts are retrieved but not used to process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "All core methods contain only placeholder strings such as 'do_sth_with', with no actual logic; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a template with placeholder implementations meant for developers to fill in. There are no external input sources, no data handling, and no data sinks that process untrusted input. The methods merely contain strings indicating where logic should be inserted, and no operations could lead to malicious behavior. The class is designed for extensibility, not execution, and contains no active code that could be malicious. The overall structure and content do not exhibit any signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable template intended for developers to implement custom distributions. It contains no actual logic, data handling, or external interactions that could be malicious. It appears safe and intentionally minimal, serving solely as a scaffolding for further development.",
