  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code is a template for distribution classes, with parameters passed during init and placeholders in distribution methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual data flows or sinks; placeholder strings are used.\n- **Anomalies:** All methods contain placeholder strings ('do_sth_with(...)'), indicating incomplete implementation, not malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a scaffold, not active logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The placeholders are meant to be replaced by developers.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to incomplete code, but not a security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static, with no external data or network activity.\n- Contains placeholders and incomplete methods.\n- No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- Purpose is for development, not production.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Reiterates that the code is a template with placeholder logic.\n- No external data handling, no network activity.\n- Contains only placeholder strings ('do_sth_with(...)') and no actual code logic.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the placeholder nature.\n- No actual executable logic, no external communication, no secrets.\n- Designed solely as a scaffold.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also confirms that the code contains only placeholder strings, no real logic.\n- No external data sources, no data sinks, no malicious patterns.\n- Serves as a developer scaffold.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports agree that the code is a development template with placeholder methods.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward and intentionally incomplete.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; the code is non-functional and meant for development.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to incomplete placeholder code, not security risk)\n\nThis code is a benign scaffold intended for developers to implement distribution classes within the skpro framework. It poses no security threat in its current form.",
