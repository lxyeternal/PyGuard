  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, placeholders, and intent, to assess the presence of malicious activity, the appropriateness of scores, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a template with placeholder strings (\"do_sth_with(...)\") instead of real logic. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The structure is consistent with a scaffold meant for developers to implement actual logic later.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no active threats, just a template.\n- **Justification:** The placeholders are intended for developers, not malicious code. The structure is transparent, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code contains placeholder strings and incomplete methods. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data leaks.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, possibly due to the template nature.\n- **Justification:** The minimal risk score accounts for the fact that it's a scaffold, not active code.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** The malware score is appropriate at 0; the security risk is low but could be marginally increased to 0.2 for caution, but 0.1 is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, placeholders with no actual logic. No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external communication.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — consistent with a template.\n- **Justification:** No active malicious code, only unimplemented methods.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern — placeholder strings, no real logic, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — safe template.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely scaffolding, with no malicious features.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a scaffold with placeholder strings and no actual logic. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no active threats.\n- **Justification:** All methods are placeholders, intended for developers to implement.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All are correctly set at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, given the transparent, placeholder nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), which is reasonable for a template, but could be increased marginally if desired. However, given the absence of any active malicious behavior, 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Security:** The code is a straightforward, well-structured template with placeholders, not active or malicious code.\n- **Potential Risks:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate as-is.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear placeholder code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to being a template, but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's nature. No further action needed.",
