{
  "purpose": "Template for implementing new probability distribution estimators within the skpro framework, providing structure and guidance for developers.",
  "sources": "Code is static; no external data sources or inputs are read during execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines structure and placeholders without actual data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Contains placeholder strings and incomplete method implementations (e.g., 'do_sth_with(...)', pass statements), indicating it is a template rather than functional code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a structured template for defining custom probability distributions in the skpro framework. It includes method signatures, parameter placeholders, and detailed instructions for implementation. No actual logic, data handling, or external communication exists. The placeholder strings ('do_sth_with(...)') are intended to be replaced by real logic during development. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code’s purpose is to facilitate safe, structured development of distribution estimators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-functional template intended for distribution implementation; it shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. Its design avoids external dependencies and unsafe practices. The only notable aspect is its incomplete state, which is appropriate for a template. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
