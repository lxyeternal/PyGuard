  "purpose": "Template for implementing new probability distribution estimators within skpro, providing guidance and structure for defining distribution parameters and methods.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters during initialization, reads class attributes (e.g., _bc_params), and input arguments for distribution functions such as x, p, and x in sample methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be in parameters or input data, but no explicit sinks are present; methods for data output are placeholders.",
  "flows": "Parameters are broadcast and used internally for calculations; distribution methods (pdf, cdf, etc.) process input data, but actual logic is not implemented, only placeholder strings.",
  "anomalies": "All method implementations are placeholders with string concatenations indicating where logic should be; no actual code logic present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code features or malicious loops. The template contains extensive comments but no executable malicious code. No evidence of data exfiltration, network connections, or reverse shells. No suspicious imports or external communications. Overall, code is strictly a template with no active malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive template for defining probability distributions, including method stubs and detailed instructions for implementation. It contains no actual executable logic beyond string placeholders. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The comments and structure indicate a focus on guidance rather than functionality. There are no signs of obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious data handling. The code is intended for development purposes and does not perform any operations outside of potential placeholder string concatenations. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent can be inferred from the static template code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable template for defining custom probability distributions within skpro. It contains no active logic, network activity, or malicious features. It is safe and intended solely for structural guidance during implementation. No security risks or malware behaviors are present.",
