  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, correctness, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs dynamic module importation, reflection, and filtering based on module name prefixes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on standard Python libraries (`importlib`, `pkgutil`, `inspect`) and typical reflection techniques.\n- The main potential concern is the dynamic import of modules, which could be malicious if module names are supplied from untrusted sources. However, the code itself does not perform malicious actions or data exfiltration.\n- No malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; utility functions for retrieving functions/classes, excluding modules starting with \"all\" or \"test\".\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities detected.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — correct, no malware.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 — minimal, considering dynamic importation, but no actual risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; similar utility functions.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities; standard reflection utility.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — still low, considering dynamic import, but no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; safe reflection utility.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** Slight note that dynamic imports can be risky if module sources are untrusted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly notes that importing arbitrary modules can be risky but clarifies that the code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate, no malware detected.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — considering potential risks of dynamic import, this is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The same as above; standard reflection utility with minimal risk.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily a safe reflection utility.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The only potential concern is the dynamic importation of modules, which could be risky if module names are untrusted. However, since the code does not execute or process untrusted data, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, using standard libraries.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, considering the potential risks of dynamic importation, but no actual exploitation or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, standard reflection utility, with negligible security risk. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
