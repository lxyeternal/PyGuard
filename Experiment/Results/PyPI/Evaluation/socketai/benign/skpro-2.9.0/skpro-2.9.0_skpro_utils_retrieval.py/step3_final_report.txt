  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving functions and classes from modules, excluding modules starting with 'all', 'test', or 'contrib'.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, pkgutil.walk_packages, inspect.getmembers, module.__path__, module.__name__, obj.__module__",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute code beyond introspection.",
  "flows": "importlib.import_module -> walk through package modules -> getmembers with condition -> filter by module origin -> collect objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; standard reflection code. Slightly risky if module names are untrusted, but no malicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic import and introspection to list functions and classes in a package and its submodules, excluding certain modules by name prefix. It does not execute untrusted code or contain hardcoded secrets. The main security concern is the potential for importing malicious modules if module names are untrusted, but the code itself remains benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be slightly increased from 0.2 to 0.3 to reflect the import risk in untrusted contexts, but given the code's nature, 0.2 remains acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for module introspection. No malware or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is the use of dynamic imports, which could be risky if module names are untrusted. Overall, the existing scores are appropriate, with a slight acknowledgment of import-related risk.",
