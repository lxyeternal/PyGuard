  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving functions and classes from specified modules and their submodules.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, pkgutil.walk_packages, inspect.getmembers",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems",
  "flows": "importlib.import_module retrieves modules; inspect.getmembers retrieves objects; filters exclude certain modules; collected objects are returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or malicious code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules within a package, inspects modules for functions or classes based on conditions, and filters out modules starting with 'all', 'test', or 'contrib'. The use of importlib, pkgutil, and inspect is standard for plugin or module discovery. No external communication, data exfiltration, or code execution occurs. The code respects module boundaries and filters imported objects based on their module origin. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for module introspection, with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and benign, focusing on collecting functions and classes from modules.",
