  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for module introspection. No malware or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is the use of dynamic imports, which could be risky if module names are untrusted. Overall, the existing scores are appropriate, with a slight acknowledgment of import-related risk."
