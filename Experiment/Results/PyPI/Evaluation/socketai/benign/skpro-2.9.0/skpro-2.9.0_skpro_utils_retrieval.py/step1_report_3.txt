  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving functions and classes from Python modules and submodules, with filtering based on module name prefixes.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, inspect.getmembers, pkgutil.walk_packages, module attributes (__path__, __name__, __module__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported via importlib.import_module; getmembers retrieves objects; objects are filtered by module origin and type.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution, network access, or file manipulation. Filtering based on module name prefixes is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to dynamically import modules and retrieve functions and classes based on certain conditions. It carefully skips modules starting with specified prefixes ('all', 'test', 'contrib') to avoid certain modules. Use of importlib and inspect modules is standard for reflection purposes. No suspicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The functions only inspect and filter module objects. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code structure is typical for reflection utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for module introspection and filtering, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
