  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs dynamic module importing, introspection, and filtering based on module name prefixes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution beyond standard reflection.\n- The code could pose a security risk if used with untrusted modules, but this is acknowledged and not necessarily malicious.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Clear, the code inspects modules, excludes certain prefixes, and retrieves functions/classes.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is reasonable; the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar utility, standard reflection, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score due to the potential of importing arbitrary modules, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, with emphasis on filtering by prefixes.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Notes that dynamic imports could be risky if modules are untrusted, but no malicious code is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The slightly higher risk score accounts for the potential danger of importing untrusted modules, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar reflection utility, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The risk score reflects the potential if used with untrusted modules, but the code itself remains safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential risk of dynamic imports if used improperly. These are reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern is the use of dynamic imports, which could be risky if modules are untrusted, but this is acknowledged and not an actual flaw in the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (accounts for the potential risk of dynamic module loading in untrusted contexts)\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports and reflects a cautious but accurate evaluation of the code's security posture.",
