  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving functions and classes from Python modules and submodules, excluding certain modules based on name prefixes.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module(), pkgutil.walk_packages(), inspect.getmembers()",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code retrieves metadata from modules but does not process or execute untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "importlib.import_module() loads modules; pkgutil.walk_packages() discovers submodules; inspect.getmembers() retrieves objects; filtering by condition and module origin.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules and their submodules, then inspects and filters functions and classes based on provided conditions. It excludes modules starting with 'all', 'test', or 'contrib'. The process is standard for reflection-based module inspection. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, network communication, or data leakage. No obfuscated code or suspicious control flow is present. The overall functionality appears to be safe and intended for module metadata extraction.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs safe, standard reflection and module traversal tasks without evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or malicious behaviors and has no security vulnerabilities based on the visible logic.",
