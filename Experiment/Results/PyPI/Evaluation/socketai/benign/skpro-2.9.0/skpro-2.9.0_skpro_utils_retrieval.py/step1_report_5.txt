  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving functions and classes from modules and submodules, with filtering based on module name prefixes.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, inspect.getmembers, pkgutil.walk_packages, package.__path__",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into system effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "importlib.import_module -> inspect.getmembers -> process module objects",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic importing and introspection without any explicit safeguards; however, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The filtering based on module name prefixes is benign and for organizational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules and their submodules, then inspects and retrieves functions and classes satisfying specific conditions. It skips modules starting with 'all' or 'test'. The dynamic import process could potentially load malicious modules if untrusted module names are supplied externally, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. No insecure code execution, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The logic is purely for introspection and filtering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for module introspection, with no signs of malicious intent. It only dynamically imports and inspects modules, which is common in plugin or plugin-like systems. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
