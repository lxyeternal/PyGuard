  "purpose": "Utility functions for dynamically retrieving functions and classes from Python modules, including submodules, with filtering based on module name prefixes.",
  "sources": "Import statements (importlib, inspect, pkgutil, functools), module loading via importlib.import_module, pkgutil.walk_packages, inspect.getmembers",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of dynamically imported modules and objects retrieved via inspect.getmembers, which could execute malicious code if modules are malicious or tampered with, but no explicit data sinks for untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> Walk through submodules -> Conditional filtering based on module name -> Gathering objects with inspect.getmembers -> Filtering based on module origin",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior. Use of dynamic imports is typical for plugin systems but can be risky if the module source is malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads modules dynamically and inspects them for functions and classes, skipping modules starting with 'all' or 'test'. It uses standard Python introspection libraries and follows conventional practices. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden code. The use of importlib and inspect does not inherently pose a security threat; however, dynamically importing arbitrary modules can be risky if untrusted sources are involved. The code does not evaluate the trustworthiness of modules before importing. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads. Overall, the functions are typical for plugin or reflection-based systems with minimal security risks, assuming the modules being imported are from trusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe module introspection and filtering without explicit malicious intent. It could pose a security risk if used with untrusted modules, but as presented, it is a standard utility pattern without malicious behavior.",
