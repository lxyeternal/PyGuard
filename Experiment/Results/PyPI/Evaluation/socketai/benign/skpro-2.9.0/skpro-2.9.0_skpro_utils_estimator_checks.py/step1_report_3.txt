  "purpose": "Utility function to run compatibility and interface tests on estimator objects, primarily for development and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from skbase.utils.dependencies, get_test_classes_for_obj from skpro.tests.test_class_register, and the estimator parameter passed into check_estimator.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential misuse could arise if test classes or the test execution functions perform unsafe operations, but these are external to this code.",
  "flows": "The function checks dependencies, retrieves relevant test classes, runs tests on the estimator, collects results, and optionally prints a summary. No untrusted data flows are evident within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code relies on external test classes and a dependency checker, but no malicious or unusual behavior is detectable.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency checking for pytest, retrieves appropriate test classes for the provided estimator object, executes test suites, collects results, and optionally outputs a summary. It imports functions from external modules and dynamically invokes test methods. There are no indications of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious actions. The logic is straightforward, serving as a test harness for estimator validation, with no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard testing utility intended for development and validation of estimator objects. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the static analysis of this fragment. It relies on external test frameworks and modules, but within this code, there are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
