  "purpose": "Utility function for running tests on a given estimator to check compatibility and correctness.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'estimator', 'tests_to_run', 'fixtures_to_run', 'tests_to_exclude', 'fixtures_to_exclude'. External dependencies include 'get_test_classes_for_obj' from 'skpro.tests.test_class_register'.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write or transmit untrusted data outside its scope. No evident data leakage or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'estimator' and test parameters flow into 'get_test_classes_for_obj', then into each test class's 'run_tests' method, and results are aggregated and optionally printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard test execution and dependency checks.",
  "analysis": "The code first checks for optional 'pytest' dependency, then retrieves test classes associated with the estimator object. It iterates through these classes, executing their 'run_tests' method with provided parameters, collecting results. The function then identifies any failed tests and prints a summary if verbose. The overall logic is straightforward, relying on external testing frameworks and standard Python practices. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The primary function is to facilitate testing of estimators in a controlled manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a testing utility for estimator validation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard dependency checks and test execution without engaging in harmful activities.",
