  "purpose": "Utility function to run compatibility and correctness tests on estimator objects, ensuring they meet interface standards and behave as expected.",
  "sources": "Reads input estimator object, dependencies on external test classes, and pytest dependency check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; results are collected internally and printed; no data exfiltration or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Dependency check -> retrieval of test classes -> execution of tests via run_tests() -> collection of results -> reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward dependency check and dynamic class invocation are standard in testing utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency verification for pytest, dynamically loads test classes for the estimator, runs tests, and reports results. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or modify files. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The reliance on external test classes is typical for such utilities, and no signs of sabotage or malware are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the static code analysis and the code's benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign testing utility for estimator validation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
