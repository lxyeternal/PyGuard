{
  "purpose": "Utility function to run a suite of tests on a specified estimator object for validation and compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from skbase.utils.dependencies and skpro.tests.test_class_register; function parameters and local variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform network/file operations.",
  "flows": "The function calls get_test_classes_for_obj with the estimator, then iterates over returned test classes to run tests, collecting results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code primarily manages test execution flow.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dependencies, verifies the presence of pytest, retrieves test classes for the estimator, runs tests via run_tests method, and compiles results. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated sections. The main activity is orchestrating testing procedures, which is typical for validation utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a testing utility designed for development and validation of estimator objects, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It merely manages the process of running tests and reporting results.",
