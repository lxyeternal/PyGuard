  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data loading utilities with a significant but controlled security concern stemming from the use of load_python_exec for executing code. No active malware or sabotage is present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment. Proper validation, sanitization, or sandboxing of inputs to load_python_exec is recommended to mitigate potential code injection risks."
