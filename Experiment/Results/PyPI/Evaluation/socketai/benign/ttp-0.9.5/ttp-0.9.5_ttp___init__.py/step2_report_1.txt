  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is a simple setup snippet that defines package metadata and performs a Python version check to conditionally import modules.\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, external data handling, or malicious code.\n   - The imports are standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions and do not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Structure:**\n   - The code's logic is straightforward: determine Python version and import modules accordingly.\n   - The reports consistently recognize this as standard practice with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No obfuscation, unusual control flow, or hidden operations are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Also 0, which aligns with the code's clarity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0, since the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern could be if the imported modules are malicious. However, the code only imports from the 'ttp' package, which appears to be a legitimate dependency, and no malicious behavior is indicated.\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about maliciousness or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and are reasonable.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical compatibility snippet with no security concerns.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate in their analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign and standard for cross-version support. No further action is necessary.",
