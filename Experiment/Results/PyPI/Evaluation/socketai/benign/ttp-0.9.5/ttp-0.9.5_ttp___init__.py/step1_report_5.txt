  "sinks": "Import statements that load 'ttp' modules based on Python version.",
  "flows": "Version check -> conditional imports of 'ttp' modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Imports are conditional based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata and performs a Python version check to import modules accordingly. The import paths are standard for compatibility and do not indicate malicious intent. No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations detected. The code appears to be straightforward setup code for a package with version compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module initialization code with version-based conditional imports. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
