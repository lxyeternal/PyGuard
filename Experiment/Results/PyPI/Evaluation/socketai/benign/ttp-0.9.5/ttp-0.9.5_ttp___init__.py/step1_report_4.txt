  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and intended for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata, checks Python version, and imports modules accordingly. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present. It performs environment detection and conditional imports, which are standard practices for compatibility. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns are observed. The code does not perform any data manipulation, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version-checking and conditional import snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
