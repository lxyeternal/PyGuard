  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import modules based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'version_info' from sys to determine Python version.",

  "flows": "Source: 'version_info' -> Conditional import statements -> Imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The imports are conditional based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata such as 'name', 'author', and 'version'. It then determines the Python major version using 'sys.version_info'. Depending on whether the version is Python 2 or 3, it imports specific modules. The imports seem to adapt to different Python versions for compatibility. No external data inputs, data leakage, or malicious logic are present. The structure is typical for cross-version compatibility code, with no anomalies or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility setup for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
