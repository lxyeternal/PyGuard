{
  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import specific components based on Python version",
  "sources": "Version info from sys module, conditional imports from ttp package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; import statements may load code, but this is standard for dependencies",
  "flows": "None explicitly, just conditional imports based on environment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; conditional import logic is standard",
  "analysis": "The code sets module metadata such as __all__, __author__, and __version__. It imports sys.version_info to detect the Python version and conditionally imports modules from the 'ttp' package accordingly. No user input handling, no network operations, and no unusual code behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for Python modules that support multiple Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be standard setup code for a Python package supporting both Python 2 and 3. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code. It simply manages imports based on environment conditions.",
