  "purpose": "Define package metadata and perform Python version detection to conditionally import modules for compatibility.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info to determine Python version",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "version_info → conditional import statements",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check and imports",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata and uses sys.version_info to detect Python major version. Based on the version, it imports modules from 'ttp' or 'ttp.ttp' and 'ttp.utils.quick_parse' for Python 3, or from 'ttp' and 'utils.quick_parse' for Python 2. The logic is standard for cross-version compatibility. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is simple, well-structured, and aligns with common practices for supporting multiple Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as standard, straightforward, and safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
