{
  "purpose": "This code sets up module metadata and imports functions/classes from the 'ttp' package based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors; conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level variables such as purpose, author, version, and exports. It dynamically imports components from the 'ttp' package depending on whether the environment runs Python 2 or 3. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, network calls, or suspicious logic. The structure appears to be typical for cross-version compatibility in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for module metadata and conditional imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
