  "purpose": "Parse attribute strings to extract attribute names, args, and kwargs, using regex and eval() for options processing.",
  "sources": "Input string 'line' containing attribute attributes; the 'options' substring within each attribute.",
  "sinks": "The eval() function evaluating the options string, which can execute arbitrary code if input is malicious.",
  "flows": "Regex extracts attribute name and options; options string is evaluated with eval() in get_attributes().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on untrusted input without sanitization; reliance on custom _UndefSubst class does not mitigate security risk.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is straightforward attribute parsing. The critical security flaw is the use of eval() on data derived from external input, which can lead to remote code execution. The _UndefSubst class modifies evaluation behavior but does not prevent malicious code execution. No malicious payloads or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.8, risk ~0.9) are consistent with the vulnerability. The code is not obfuscated, and the overall security risk is high due to unsafe eval usage. The code should be refactored to replace eval() with a safer alternative, such as ast.literal_eval() or a custom parser, to mitigate the security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the unsafe use of eval() on untrusted input, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The code is otherwise benign and straightforward. The high security risk score is justified; malware score should be zero as no malicious payload is present. Refactoring is recommended to eliminate eval() and improve security.",
