  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the unsafe use of eval() on untrusted input, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The code is otherwise benign and straightforward. The high security risk score is justified; malware score should be zero as no malicious payload is present. Refactoring is recommended to eliminate eval() and improve security."
