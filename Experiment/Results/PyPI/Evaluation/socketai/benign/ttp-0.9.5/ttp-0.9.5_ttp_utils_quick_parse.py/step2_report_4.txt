  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a simple wrapper around the 'ttp' library, designed to parse text data with user-defined templates.\n- No network activity, file I/O, or code execution is present.\n- The 'ttp' library is an open-source text parsing library, not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The functions are parameterized and flexible, with no apparent malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Clear, straightforward utility for parsing with TTP.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code or behavior. Uses external library benignly.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, safe utility wrapper.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Note:** The securityRisk is set to 0.1, implying minimal risk. Given the code's benign nature, this seems appropriate. Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, safe utility.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, benign utility.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Note:** The securityRisk is zero here, which is consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as previous, safe utility.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n\n**Note:** The securityRisk is slightly above zero but still very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### General assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign utility wrapper.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are low, mostly 0.1 or 0, which is reasonable given the context.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (e.g., 0.1) is acceptable, but if aiming for conservative assessment, it could be zero across all reports, given the benign nature.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.05 to be very conservative)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a safe, straightforward utility function for parsing text data.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are aligned with the code's benign nature.",
