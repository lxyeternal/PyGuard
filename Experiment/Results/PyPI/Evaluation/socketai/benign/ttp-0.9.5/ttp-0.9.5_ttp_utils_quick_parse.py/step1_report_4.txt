{
  "purpose": "A utility function to parse network configuration data using the 'ttp' library and user-defined templates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'data' (string) and 'template' (string).",
  "sinks": "The function calls 'ttp' constructor and 'parser.result', which process the input data.",
  "flows": "Input data and template flow into the 'ttp' parser object, which then processes and returns results via 'parser.result()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of third-party library 'ttp' is benign. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around the 'ttp' library to facilitate data parsing with customizable parameters. It includes parameter handling, parser instantiation, and result retrieval. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The only external dependency is the 'ttp' library, which is open-source and designed for data parsing. No malicious or harmful code behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function intended for parsing text data with templates. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
