{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data collection and network communication, potentially for malicious data exfiltration or unauthorized system access.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user inputs, or configuration files; obtaining system information; capturing clipboard or keyboard input.",
  "sinks": "Sending data over network sockets, HTTP requests to external domains, writing to system files or registry, executing subprocesses.",
  "flows": "Data from sources such as environment variables or user input are captured and then transmitted over network sinks, possibly after obfuscation or encoding.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64 encoding, unusual network endpoints, dynamic code execution, obfuscated variable names, or hidden functions. Hardcoded URLs or credentials may be present.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined thoroughly for suspicious patterns, including network communication to unknown domains, dynamic code evaluation, and data collection routines. Particular attention is paid to any obfuscated segments or hidden behaviors. The code's structure and imports are checked to identify potential backdoors or malicious activities. Any hardcoded secrets or excessive obfuscation are flagged as anomalies. The overall behavior suggests possible malicious intent due to data exfiltration mechanisms, obscure functions, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple signs of potentially malicious behavior, including data collection and transmission to external servers. There are indicators of obfuscation and hidden operations that could serve malicious purposes. Due to these findings, the package should be considered suspicious and potentially dangerous without further context or verification.",
