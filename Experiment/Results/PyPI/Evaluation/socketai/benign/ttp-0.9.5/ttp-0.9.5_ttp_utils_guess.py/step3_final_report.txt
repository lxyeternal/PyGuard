  "purpose": "A utility function wrapping difflib.get_close_matches for string similarity matching.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'word', 'possibilities', 'count', 'cutoff'. No external data sources or inputs beyond parameters.",
  "sinks": "Return value of difflib.get_close_matches; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into get_close_matches, which processes string similarity; results are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Python's standard library function for string matching. It accepts input parameters, processes them with a safe, well-understood library function, and returns the result. No external network, file I/O, or malicious behavior is present. The code is simple, clear, and free of obfuscation or vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for string similarity matching, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores provided are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
