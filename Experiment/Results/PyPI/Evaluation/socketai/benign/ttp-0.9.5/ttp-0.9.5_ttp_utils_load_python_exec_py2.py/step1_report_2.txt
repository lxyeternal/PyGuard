  "purpose": "The function aims to load and execute Python code from a string, providing compatibility for Python 2.6 and handling different syntax variations.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text_data' which contains the code to be executed or evaluated.",
  "sinks": "exec and eval functions which execute code from the string; these are critical points where untrusted input can lead to malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "text_data is passed to compile and executed via exec, then possibly evaluated with eval if data remains empty.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of exec with compile and inline exception handling; updating globals with data; fallback to eval. The code executes arbitrary input dynamically, which is inherently risky.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a dynamic execution environment by compiling and executing code from a string input, which can be exploited if 'text_data' contains malicious code. The use of 'exec compile' allows for execution of arbitrary code with the provided globals, potentially enabling code injection attacks. The fallback to eval adds additional risk, as eval also executes arbitrary code. The function modifies global variables and executes code that could manipulate system state or access sensitive data if malicious input is provided. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or backdoors but relies on the caller to ensure safety.",
  "conclusion": "The function is designed for flexible code loading and execution but inherently risky due to the use of 'exec' and 'eval' with untrusted input. It poses a high security risk if used with untrusted data, as it could execute malicious code.",
