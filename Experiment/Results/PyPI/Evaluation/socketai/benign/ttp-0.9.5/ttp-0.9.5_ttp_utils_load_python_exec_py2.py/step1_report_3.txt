  "purpose": "This function provides compatibility for Python 2.6 to load and execute text-formatted Python code, supporting different syntax versions and evaluating the code to return data structures.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text_data', which contains the Python code or data to be loaded and executed.",
  "sinks": "exec and eval functions, which execute untrusted code or data, potentially leading to code execution or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input 'text_data' flows into 'compile' and 'exec'/'eval' functions, which may execute arbitrary code with the provided 'globals_dict' context.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' with 'compile' and 'eval' on untrusted input, which can execute arbitrary code. The code manipulates 'globals_dict' and updates it with execution results, possibly enabling malicious code to affect global state.",
  "analysis": "The function is designed to load Python code or data from a string, supporting compatibility with Python 2.6. It compiles and executes 'text_data' within a specific global context, which includes potential custom built-ins. The 'exec' call uses the 'compile' function, which could be exploited if 'text_data' contains malicious code. The 'eval' fallback evaluates 'text_data' directly, which can also execute malicious code if 'text_data' is untrusted. The inclusion of 'globals_dict' with potentially custom or manipulated built-ins and the execution of arbitrary code represent significant security risks. There are no safeguards to prevent malicious input from executing arbitrary code, making this a high-risk function if used with untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes arbitrary code via 'exec' and 'eval' on input data without any sanitization or validation, representing a high security risk. It can execute malicious code if 'text_data' is untrusted. There are no indications of malicious intent in the code itself, but the design is inherently dangerous if misused.",
