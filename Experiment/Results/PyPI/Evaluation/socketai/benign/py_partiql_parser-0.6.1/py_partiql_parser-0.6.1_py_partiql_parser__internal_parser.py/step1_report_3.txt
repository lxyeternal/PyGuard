{
  "purpose": "The code implements parsers for processing SQL-like queries for DynamoDB and S3 data sources, converting them into operations on provided data structures.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include source_data dictionary for DynamoDB and source_data string for S3 JSON documents; query strings provided to parse methods.",
  "sinks": "Data is read from the source_data structures; results are produced and returned. No direct untrusted data output or external system interaction identified.",
  "flows": "Query string is split into clauses; parsed into respective components (SELECT, FROM, WHERE); source data is filtered and transformed based on parsed clauses; results are generated accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data are present. No obfuscated code or unusual code constructs are observed. The code performs typical parsing operations without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing of SQL-like statements for DynamoDB and S3 data, converting query strings into filtering, selection, updating, deletion, and insertion operations on in-memory data structures. No code injections, external network interactions, or malicious payloads are detected. Usage of regex for splitting clauses is straightforward; no dynamic code execution or unsafe eval functions are used. Data handling appears to be in-memory and limited to the provided data structures. No suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system harm is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of query parsing for in-memory datasets, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for data manipulation based on provided query strings. Overall, the code appears benign and safe.",
