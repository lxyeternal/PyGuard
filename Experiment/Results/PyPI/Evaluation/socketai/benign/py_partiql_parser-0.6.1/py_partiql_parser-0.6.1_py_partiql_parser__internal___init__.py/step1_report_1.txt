  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize some modules, possibly for data processing or network communication, but no specific purpose is clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing external libraries, or loading files (exact sources not visible due to missing code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing to network sockets, files, or executing system commands (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Uncertain due to incomplete code; generally, data may flow from input sources to processing functions and then to sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies are visible in the partial code. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures evident in the provided fragment.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is empty or incomplete, lacking visible logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. Without further code, it is impossible to identify malicious patterns or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware indicators are apparent in this partial view.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code provided, there are no clear signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign but is insufficiently complete for a thorough assessment.",
