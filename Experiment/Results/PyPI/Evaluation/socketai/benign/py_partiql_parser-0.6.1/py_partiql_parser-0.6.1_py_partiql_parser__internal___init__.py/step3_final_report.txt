  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code snippets for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns, ensuring supply chain integrity.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, input files, network data, system commands, and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, environment variables, and external data stores.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network data flow into processing functions, which may output to network sockets, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; code is incomplete or straightforward; no unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either incomplete or straightforward with no signs of malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Confidence levels are high where code is available, and low where code is absent. No suspicious data flows or sink behaviors are observed. The overall assessment indicates benign code with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "All code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and security risk scores conservatively set at 0.1 or 0.2. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
