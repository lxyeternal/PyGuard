{
  "purpose": "Parse and interpret FROM clauses in SQL-like queries, mapping aliases to table or file names, and handle nested data retrieval for specific data sources such as S3 or DynamoDB.",
  "sources": "Input string 'from_clause' parameter; data documents in get_source_data methods; internal tokenization and validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Return values from get_source_data methods; internal data structures used for nested data extraction.",
  "flows": "from_clause string -> ClauseTokenizer tokenization -> alias mapping -> nested data access in _get_nested_source_data -> output document or data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Validation in DynamoDBFromParser prevents numeric aliases, which is standard validation, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing of FROM clauses, converting them into alias mappings. It handles nested data retrieval for S3 objects, including list handling and alias substitution. Validation in DynamoDBFromParser prevents unsupported alias patterns. No external network calls, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured parser for FROM clauses with nested data handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain vulnerabilities are evident. The validation steps are standard security practices. Overall, the code is secure and appropriate for use in supply chain contexts.",
