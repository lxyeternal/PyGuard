  "purpose": "Convert CSV data to JSON format and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings for CSV data, input list of dictionaries for JSON conversion.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data leaks or untrusted data handling beyond standard parsing and string joining.",
  "flows": "CSV input -> parsing and JSON serialization; JSON input -> CSV string assembly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for data format conversion. 'csv_to_json' processes CSV input by splitting lines and creating JSON objects; 'json_to_csv' converts a list of dicts into a CSV string using delimiters. There are no external data sources, environment variable usage, or network activities. No code injection, malicious data handling, or obfuscated code present. The functions use standard Python features without dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard data format conversions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe based on the provided content.",
