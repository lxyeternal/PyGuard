{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting CSV data to JSON format and vice versa, facilitating data transformation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input strings for CSV data in 'csv_to_json'; list of dictionaries in 'json_to_csv'.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not contain external data sinks; they process data in-memory without external output or network transmission.",
  "flows": "CSV input is split into lines and fields, then converted into JSON objects; JSON data is serialized back into CSV strings via joining values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic data format conversions without external data access, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns. It handles headers appropriately and serializes data correctly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions operate purely on in-memory data, with no network or system calls. The logic is simple and standard, with no anomalies or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard data transformation tasks without malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
