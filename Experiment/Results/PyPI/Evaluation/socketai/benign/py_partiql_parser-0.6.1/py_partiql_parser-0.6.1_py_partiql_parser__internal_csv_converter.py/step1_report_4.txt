  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert CSV data to JSON format and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'input' strings for csv_to_json and 'input' list for json_to_csv.",
  "sinks": "Output strings, potential for data manipulation or injection if inputs are untrusted, but no external data sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "csv_to_json reads the CSV input string, processes headers, converts lines into JSON strings. json_to_csv takes JSON list and concatenates values into CSV format.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity. The code performs straightforward data transformations without obfuscation or hidden behaviors. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No external data fetching or environment variable usage that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard data conversion tasks. csv_to_json splits input string into lines, processes headers if included, then converts each line into a JSON object string. json_to_csv joins JSON object values into CSV format with specified delimiters. There are no apparent security risks such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with clear logic and no suspicious operations or external calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for data format conversion with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and suitable for use in applications that handle CSV/JSON transformations.",
