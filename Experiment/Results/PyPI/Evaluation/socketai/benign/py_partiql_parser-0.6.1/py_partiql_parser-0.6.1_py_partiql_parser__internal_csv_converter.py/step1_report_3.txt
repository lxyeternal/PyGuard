{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert CSV data to JSON format and vice versa, facilitating data transformation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters: 'input' strings for csv_to_json and a list of dictionaries for json_to_csv.",
  "sinks": "The code generates output strings; no external sinks are present, nor does it perform network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to output strings, with internal processing converting formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious code patterns detected. No use of unsafe functions or environment variables. The code performs straightforward data transformations without external effects.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple data format conversions. It processes input strings or data structures, splits lines or fields, assigns headers if necessary, and reconstructs data in the target format. No external data sources, sinks, or side effects are present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious operations are detected. The functions do not execute any system commands, network operations, or sensitive data handling beyond basic string processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign data transformation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic CSV-JSON conversions without external interactions or suspicious patterns.",
