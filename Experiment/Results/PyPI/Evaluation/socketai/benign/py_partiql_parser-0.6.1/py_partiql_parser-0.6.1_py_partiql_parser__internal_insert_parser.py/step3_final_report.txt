  "purpose": "Parse SQL INSERT statements to extract table name and attributes, utilizing a tokenizer and JSON parser.",
  "sources": "Input query string processed by ClauseTokenizer, JSON data parsed via JsonParser.parse() on remaining input.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential issues if parsed JSON is used insecurely downstream, but not evident in current code.",
  "flows": "Tokenizer reads characters; upon reaching 'SECTION_VALUE', JSON parser processes remaining data; data assigned to 'attr'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for validation, which can be disabled, potentially bypassing syntax checks; no input sanitization or validation beyond assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SQL INSERT parser that relies on assertions for syntax validation. It processes input via ClauseTokenizer, extracting table name and attributes, parsing JSON data for attribute values. No malicious code, network, or system operations are present. The primary security concern is the reliance on assertions, which can be disabled, possibly allowing malformed or malicious input to bypass validation. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious activity is observed. External modules are assumed secure; the code itself is simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious SQL parser with moderate security risk due to validation reliance on assertions. No malware or malicious behavior detected. Replacing assertions with explicit validation and sanitization would improve robustness. Overall, the code poses low security risk but should be improved for production use.",
