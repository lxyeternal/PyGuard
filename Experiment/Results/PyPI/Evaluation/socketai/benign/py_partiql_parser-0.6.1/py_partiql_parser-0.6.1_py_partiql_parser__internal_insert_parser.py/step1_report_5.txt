  "purpose": "Parse SQL INSERT queries to extract table name and attributes for further processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input query string from ClauseTokenizer.next() and ClauseTokenizer.give_remaining().",
  "sinks": "Potentially serializes attribute values and returns them; no direct data sinks with untrusted input are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input query → Tokenizer → Parsing logic → Extracted table name and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for validation; reliance on external tokenizer and parser without input validation or sanitization; no evident malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code tokenizes and parses an SQL INSERT statement, validating certain keywords and extracting the table name and attributes. The use of assertions may raise errors if input deviates from expected structure but do not execute malicious code. External dependencies are used for tokenization and JSON parsing but are not inherently suspicious. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observable within this fragment. The process appears straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a parser for INSERT statements without evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The assertions serve as validation checks but are not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe within the context provided.",
