  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is for parsing SELECT clauses and data retrieval from JSON-like structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data is accessed via 'select' methods, results stored in lists/dicts. No network or file I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The mention of 'find_nested_data_in_object' is noted, but without its implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low security risk, malware, and obfuscated scores.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is a standard data parser with no malicious intent. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or dangerous operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code anomalies. The code operates on data passed as parameters.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low risk scores.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No malicious activity detected; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code handles parsing and selection on JSON documents.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data manipulation within internal structures; no leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Standard data processing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low security risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct description of the code's data parsing and selection functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal data handling, no external I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code structures or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, no malware.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data extraction from user-provided JSON-like data; no unsafe operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malware. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** The security risk scores are low (~0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, typical for data parsing utilities)\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern could be if the 'find_nested_data_in_object' function performs unsafe operations, but since its implementation isn't provided, no assumptions about malicious behavior can be made.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate data parsing module with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
