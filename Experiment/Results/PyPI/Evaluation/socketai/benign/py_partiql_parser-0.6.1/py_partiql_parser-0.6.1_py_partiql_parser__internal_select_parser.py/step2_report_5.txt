  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code as a query parser for structured data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies data access via 'select' and clause parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscated or malicious code, just some incomplete conditions that could cause logical errors but not malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code appears legitimate, with no malware traits.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as parsing SELECT clauses for data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious sinks; data manipulation is internal.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes clause parsing and data selection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data leakage or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly identifies the code as standard data processing, no malicious traits.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code's role in parsing and selecting data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is a typical data utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No unsafe data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states the code is standard for data extraction, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's analysis—no malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low at 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, standard code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly above zero, acknowledging that the code handles data and could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risk score accounts for the potential misuse of data handling, but overall, it’s a low-security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2             |\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure input validation and consider edge cases in real deployment, but based on the provided code and reports, there is no indication of malicious or obfuscated code.",
