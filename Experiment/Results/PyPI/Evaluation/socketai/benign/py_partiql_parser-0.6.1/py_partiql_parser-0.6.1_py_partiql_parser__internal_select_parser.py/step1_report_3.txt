{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for parsing and executing SQL-like select clauses on JSON-like documents, including support for functions and nested data extraction.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters: select_clause, document, documents, aliases, and other variables used within methods.",
  "sinks": "Data returned or appended to results lists and dictionaries, which could potentially leak data if manipulated maliciously, but no direct data leakage channels such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters through clause parsing and selection methods, resulting in filtered data stored in results or returned structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard data parsing and selection. No unusual or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of clause parsing and data selection for JSON documents, with support for functions and nested data access. No evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system manipulation, is present. The functions perform expected data filtering operations. The code structure and variable usage are typical for this kind of data processing. No signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a SQL-like clause parser for JSON documents with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a data processing library, with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
