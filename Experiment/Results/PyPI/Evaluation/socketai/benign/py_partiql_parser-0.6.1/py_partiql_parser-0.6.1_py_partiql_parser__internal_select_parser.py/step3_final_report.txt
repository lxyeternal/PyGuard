{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to parse and evaluate SELECT clauses on JSON-like data structures, supporting operations like nested data retrieval and function execution (e.g., COUNT).",
  "sources": "Input data from parameters such as 'document', 'documents', and clause strings; data is read via method calls like 'select()' and 'parse_clauses()'.",
  "sinks": "Data is accessed and manipulated within Python objects; no external network, file, or system commands are used; results are stored in dictionaries and lists.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'document' or 'documents' into 'select()' methods, then into clause objects, which process and update result collections; no external sinks or side effects are present.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code uses standard string operations and data access patterns. The 'find_nested_data_in_object' function is referenced but not provided; assuming standard behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a clause parser and data selector for structured data. It handles clause tokenization, nested data access, and function execution without any network or system calls. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data parsing utility with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary; the code appears safe for supply chain use.",
