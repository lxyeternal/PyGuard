  "purpose": "Define version and import internal modules related to parsing and data conversion utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_internal) for parsers and utilities.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports suggest data parsing and conversion functions, but no data flow from untrusted sources is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. All imports are from internal modules, which is typical for package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports specific internal modules related to parsing (DynamoDB, S3, JSON, CSV) and utility classes. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, and no evidence of data leakage, credential handling, or obfuscated code. The import statements are standard for a package that handles data processing. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. Given the limited scope, it appears to be straightforward package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a version declaration and module importer for internal utilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe based on the provided fragment.",
