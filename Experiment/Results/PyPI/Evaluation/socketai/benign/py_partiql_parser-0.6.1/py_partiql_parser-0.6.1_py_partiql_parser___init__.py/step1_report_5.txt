{
  "purpose": "Define module version and import internal parsing and utility functions for data processing tasks involving DynamoDB, S3, JSON, and CSV formats.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: '_internal.parser', '_internal.json_parser', '_internal.csv_converter', '_internal.utils'. No external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network, file system, or system commands; only internal imports and function definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code solely imports internal functions and defines a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of external input handling, environment variable usage, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports several internal modules related to data parsing and conversion. All imports are from internal package modules, indicating this is part of a larger package. No input sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization segment for a data processing library. No malicious behavior, no suspicious code or supply chain security risks identified.",
