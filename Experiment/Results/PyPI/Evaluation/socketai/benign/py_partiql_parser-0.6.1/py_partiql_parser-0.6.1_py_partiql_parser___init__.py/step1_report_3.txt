  "purpose": "Define version and import internal modules for parsing and data conversion utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules and functions",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports internal modules related to parsing (DynamoDB, S3Select, JSON, CSV) and utility classes. All imports are from internal submodules, and no external data, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The code appears to be part of a package setup or initialization, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The absence of code execution, external communication, or hidden logic suggests a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import and version declaration with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It appears safe and primarily serves to organize internal dependencies.",
