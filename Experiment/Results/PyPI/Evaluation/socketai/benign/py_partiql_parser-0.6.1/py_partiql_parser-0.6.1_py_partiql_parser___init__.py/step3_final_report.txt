{
  "purpose": "This code defines a version string and imports internal modules related to data parsing and conversion, serving as part of a package's initialization.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and import statements from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "The code does not process data flows; it only sets a version and imports modules without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with a version declaration and internal imports. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. The imports are from internal modules, typical for package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
