{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define version information and import internal modules and functions related to data parsing and conversion for a larger library or package.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing internal modules and functions such as parser, json_parser, csv_converter, and utils.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in the code; no data sinks or external outputs are visible.",
  "flows": "The code imports internal functions and classes, which may be used elsewhere in the package; no direct data flow is observable here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. All imports are from internal modules, standard practice in package design.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports several internal modules related to data parsing and conversion. These imports do not execute any code or perform any actions on their own. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The code structure is typical for a package's initialization or module setup. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward module import and version declaration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate package structure.",
