  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for parsing errors with named attributes.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class named ParserException, inheriting from Exception. It initializes with a name and message attribute, passing the message to the superclass constructor. There are no external data inputs, network interactions, or suspicious code patterns. The implementation is typical for custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns.",
