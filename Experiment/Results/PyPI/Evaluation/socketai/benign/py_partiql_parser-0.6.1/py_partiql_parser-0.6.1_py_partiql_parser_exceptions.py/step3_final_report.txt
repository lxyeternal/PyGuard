{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom exception class 'ParserException' with attributes 'name' and 'message', initializing them and calling the superclass constructor with 'message'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the constructor parameters 'name' and 'message'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external data beyond initialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters 'name' and 'message' to class attributes and the superclass constructor call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured custom exception class with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No issues or vulnerabilities are present or inferred. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
