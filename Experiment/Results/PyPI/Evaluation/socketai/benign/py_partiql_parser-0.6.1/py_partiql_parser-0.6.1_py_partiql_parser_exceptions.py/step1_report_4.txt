  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for parser errors with specific attributes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python class that subclasses Exception to create a custom error type. It initializes with a name and message, storing them as attributes, and calls the superclass constructor with the message. There are no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The structure and content appear normal for a custom exception definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
