  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for parsing errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external locations or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. The class is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'ParserException' inheriting from Exception. It initializes with a 'name' and a 'message', storing these attributes, and calls the superclass constructor with 'message'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The class appears to serve as a structured way to handle parsing errors within larger codebases.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply enhances exception handling for parsing errors.",
