{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for parsing errors with named attributes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or handling of untrusted data points present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; the class is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception inheriting from Python's Exception class. It initializes with 'name' and 'message' attributes and passes 'message' to the superclass. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network calls, or file operations. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign class definition for custom exception handling without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
