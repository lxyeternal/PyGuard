  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for parsing errors with additional attributes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The class appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an initializer that sets two attributes and calls the superclass constructor with a message. There are no indications of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The structure and syntax are standard for Python exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign custom exception definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is straightforward and standard in design.",
