  "purpose": "Utilities for managing sensitive data in Open edX filters, specifically to extract and remove sensitive form data such as passwords.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from QueryDict objects via the items() method.",
  "sinks": "Removes sensitive keys from the original form_data; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Extracts sensitive data from the input QueryDict and modifies the original object by removing sensitive entries.",
  "anomalies": "The method modifies the input form_data in-place by popping sensitive keys, which might be unintended side effect but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing sensitive data, with a method to extract and remove sensitive fields from a QueryDict object. It copies the data to iterate over, then removes sensitive keys from the original object, collecting them into a separate dictionary. No external data transmission, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The approach is straightforward and safe, focusing on data handling within the server side.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard pattern for extracting sensitive information from form data, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network operations or system modifications. The only notable point is in-place modification of input data, which is typical for such utility functions but could be problematic if unintended.",
