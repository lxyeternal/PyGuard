  "purpose": "Utilities for managing sensitive data within Open edX filter arguments, specifically for extracting sensitive fields from form data.",
  "sources": "Input data received through the 'form_data' parameter in the 'extract_sensitive_data' method, which is a QueryDict object representing form submissions.",
  "sinks": "The method manipulates the 'form_data' object by removing keys that are identified as sensitive; the extracted sensitive data is stored in a separate dictionary. No external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "The method copies 'form_data', iterates over its items, and removes sensitive keys from the copy while collecting them in a separate dictionary. No data is sent externally or stored persistently.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward data filtering. The only notable behavior is modification of the input QueryDict, but it is documented and consistent with its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for handling sensitive form data by extracting specified fields and removing them from the original data. It uses standard Django QueryDict operations and does not include any obfuscated code or malicious constructs. No external network activity, backdoors, or harmful behaviors are detected. The logic is transparent, aimed at security and privacy preservation within form handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for sensitive data management without any malicious intent or security risks. It simply extracts specified sensitive fields and removes them from the input data. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
