  "purpose": "Utility class for extracting sensitive data fields from a Django QueryDict, removing specified sensitive keys from the input, and returning them separately.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'form_data' QueryDict parameter; accesses 'sensitive_form_data' class variable to determine sensitive keys.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the input 'form_data' in-place by removing sensitive keys via 'pop', which could affect subsequent code relying on the original data.",
  "flows": "Copies 'form_data' to 'base_form_data', iterates over items, removes sensitive keys from 'form_data', and accumulates them in 'sensitive_data' to return.",
  "anomalies": "In-place mutation of the input 'form_data' via 'pop' could lead to side effects; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly extracts sensitive data by copying the input and removing specified keys. The mutation of the input data is a side effect that may cause issues if the caller expects the original data to remain unchanged. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity is present. The logic is clear and standard for such utility functions. The main concern is the in-place modification, which is acknowledged but not malicious. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is simple and transparent. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the side effect but not a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting sensitive data from form inputs. The only notable issue is the in-place mutation of the input QueryDict, which could cause side effects but does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
