  "purpose": "Utilities for managing sensitive data within Open edX filters, specifically to extract sensitive form data.",
  "sources": "Input data received through the extract_sensitive_data method, which takes a QueryDict object.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to the input form_data object (pop operation) and extraction of sensitive data into a separate dictionary.",
  "flows": "The method copies form_data, then iterates over its items, removing sensitive keys from the original and returning a dictionary of sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "The method modifies the input QueryDict object in-place by removing keys, which could lead to unintended side effects. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to extract sensitive fields from form data. It copies the input QueryDict, then removes and stores sensitive keys based on a class attribute. No external data transmission, code injection, or malicious activity is present. The in-place modification of the input data could be considered a side effect but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for handling sensitive data in forms. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The only noteworthy point is in-place modification of input, which is typical for such utility functions and not suspicious.",
