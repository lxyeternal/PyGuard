  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of comments or docstrings describing the package's purpose.\n   - There are no functions, variables, data reads/writes, or executable logic present in any of the snippets.\n   - Since the code is purely descriptive and contains no operational code, the likelihood of any security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior is effectively zero.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of executable code, data flows, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `malware`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only a comment, a risk score above 0.0 would be unjustified.\n   - All reports correctly assign a zero risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or observed.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as non-executable and benign.\n   - No challenges needed here.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nGiven that the code is purely a descriptive comment with no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns, there is no basis for malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The assessments provided are accurate and align with best practices for such benign code snippets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is harmless, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
