  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for use in filter-related error handling within a pipeline system.",
  "sources": "Input data is not directly read; the class takes parameters during instantiation, especially via **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; the class only stores and displays messages.",
  "flows": "The class captures and stores exception information; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The class design is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It allows flexible instantiation with optional message, redirect URL, status code, and additional attributes via **kwargs. The __str__ method returns the message for display purposes. There are no external data reads, network activity, or sensitive operations. The class appears to be used solely for structured error reporting within a filtering pipeline. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a benign, standard custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for error handling within a system, with no evidence of malicious intent or security flaws.",
