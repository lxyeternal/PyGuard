  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for filter-related errors in a pipeline, allowing flexible error information.",
  "sources": "User code instantiating OpenEdxFilterException, possibly passing kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling mechanisms that catch and process OpenEdxFilterException instances.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of OpenEdxFilterException with message, redirect URL, status code, and extra kwargs; then possibly caught by exception handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The constructor allows flexible setting of attributes via kwargs. The __str__ method returns the message attribute. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic. The class is purely for error handling within a system and does not perform any malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign custom exception class for handling filter errors. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
