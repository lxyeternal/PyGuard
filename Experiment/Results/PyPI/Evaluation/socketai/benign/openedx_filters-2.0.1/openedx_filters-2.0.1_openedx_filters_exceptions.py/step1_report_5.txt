{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for filter-related errors in a pipeline system.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (__init__ method arguments and kwargs).",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or output external data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored as object attributes; no external data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The class is straightforward and typical for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class, inheriting from Python's Exception. It initializes with optional message, redirect URL, status code, and additional kwargs, which are stored as attributes. The __str__ method returns the message. There are no external data sources, network calls, or obfuscated parts. The class appears to be a standard exception implementation without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a data structure for exception information, with no external data handling or suspicious code features.",
