{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for filtering errors, allowing flexible error information storage and reporting.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "None; the class simply stores attributes and provides a string representation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard custom exception class with optional parameters for message, redirect URL, status code, and additional attributes via kwargs. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The class is used solely for structured error handling within a pipeline. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and accurate.",
