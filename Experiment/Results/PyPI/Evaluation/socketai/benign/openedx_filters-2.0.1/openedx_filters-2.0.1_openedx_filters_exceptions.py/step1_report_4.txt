  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for filter-related errors in a pipeline system.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters during exception instantiation and the class definition itself.",
  "fires": "Exception instantiation and string representation method (__str__).",
  "flows": "Instantiation of OpenEdxFilterException with parameters, storing attributes, and converting to string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, external calls, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with customizable attributes via kwargs. The class includes an init method that sets attributes dynamically and a __str__ method that returns a message string. No untrusted input sources, network activity, or data leaks are present. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured exception class without any malicious or suspicious elements. It does not introduce security risks or malicious behavior.",
