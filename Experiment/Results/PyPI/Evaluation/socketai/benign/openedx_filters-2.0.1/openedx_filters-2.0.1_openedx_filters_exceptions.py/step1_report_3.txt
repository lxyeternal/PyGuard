  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for filter-related errors in a pipeline, allowing for flexible messaging and redirect information.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; the class captures exception details via its parameters and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the class only stores and displays exception information.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the class serves as a container for exception details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a flexible initializer accepting message, redirect URL, status code, and additional kwargs. It sets instance attributes accordingly and provides a string representation method returning the message. No external data inputs, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears purely for error handling within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class for a pipeline filter. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions solely as an error container, with no indications of malicious intent or security concerns.",
