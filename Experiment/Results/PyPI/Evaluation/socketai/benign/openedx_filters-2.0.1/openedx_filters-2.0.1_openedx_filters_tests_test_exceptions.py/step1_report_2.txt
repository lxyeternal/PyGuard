{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the custom exception class OpenEdxFilterException, ensuring it correctly handles extra arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads the exception class from the openedx_filters.exceptions module and creates an instance with dynamic arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data (arguments to the exception) flow into the exception constructor and are accessed as attributes; no untrusted external data sources or external effects are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The test constructs an exception with a custom argument, which is standard behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom exception class and tests its ability to accept and store extra arguments dynamically. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The test code is straightforward and focuses solely on the behavior of the exception class without involving external data sources, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple unit test for a custom exception class and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard testing code with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
