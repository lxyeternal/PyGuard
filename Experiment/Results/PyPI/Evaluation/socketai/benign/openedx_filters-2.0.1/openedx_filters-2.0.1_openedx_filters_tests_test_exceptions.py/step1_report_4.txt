  "purpose": "Unit testing for the custom exception class OpenEdxFilterException in the django application.",
  "sources": "Import of django.test and custom exception class from openedx_filters.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test creates an exception instance with custom arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django testing framework and a custom exception. It defines a test class that tests whether the custom exception correctly accepts and stores dynamic arguments. The test method instantiates the exception with a custom argument and verifies its presence as an attribute, which is standard behavior for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The code appears to be straightforward unit test code for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test for a custom exception class. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose in testing exception parameter passing.",
