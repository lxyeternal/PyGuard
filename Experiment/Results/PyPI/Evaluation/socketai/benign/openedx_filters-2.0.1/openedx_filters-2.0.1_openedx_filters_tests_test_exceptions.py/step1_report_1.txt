  "purpose": "Unit testing for custom filter hook exceptions in Django, specifically testing the OpenEdxFilterException class.",
  "sources": "Importing TestCase from django.test, and OpenEdxFilterException from openedx_filters.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not perform any data output or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test creates an exception instance with custom arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test class that verifies the behavior of a custom exception class. It imports necessary modules, defines a test case to instantiate the exception with a custom argument, and checks if that argument is accessible as an attribute. No external inputs, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and typical for testing exception behavior. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal unit test for a custom exception in Django, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply verifies that custom arguments can be stored and retrieved from an exception instance.",
