  "purpose": "Test class verifying that OpenEdxFilterException correctly stores custom arguments as attributes.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of OpenEdxFilterException with custom_arg parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Creation of exception object with custom arguments, followed by attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for unit testing exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Django test case that creates an instance of a custom exception with a custom argument and verifies attribute access. It involves no external inputs, network calls, or data leaks. The exception class supports dynamic arguments, which is typical. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is clear, standard, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for a custom exception class, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
