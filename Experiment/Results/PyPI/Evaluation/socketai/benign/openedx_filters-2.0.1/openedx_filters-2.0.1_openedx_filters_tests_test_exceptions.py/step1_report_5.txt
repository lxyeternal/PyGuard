  "purpose": "Unit tests for custom filter hook exceptions in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method definitions, exception instantiation, attribute access.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; test merely verifies exception handling and attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test case class using Django's testing framework to verify the behavior of a custom exception class. It creates an exception with an extra argument and checks that this argument is accessible as an instance attribute. No external data input, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward, standard for unit testing, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a custom exception class and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply verifies that extra arguments are stored as instance attributes, which is typical in exception classes.",
