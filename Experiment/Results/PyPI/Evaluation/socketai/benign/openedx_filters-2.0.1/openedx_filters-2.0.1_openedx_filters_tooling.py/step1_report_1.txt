  "purpose": "This code provides tooling to configure, load, and execute Open edX filters dynamically via pipelines defined in settings. It facilitates modular filter steps, error handling, and configuration retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from Django settings (OPEN_EDX_FILTERS_CONFIG), imports filter step functions via import_string, and processes input arguments passed to run_pipeline.",
  "sinks": "Executes dynamically imported filter functions, potentially passing untrusted data into their run_filter methods. Log statements output exception details.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is read from Django settings -> imported dynamically via import_string -> passed as arguments into filter step instances -> results potentially accumulated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no code injection, and no unusual data leaks observed. Error handling is standard, and dynamic imports are confined to configured paths.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages dynamic import and execution of pipeline steps for filtering, with configuration fetched from Django settings. It handles errors gracefully, allowing silent continuation if configured. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The dynamic import pattern is controlled via configuration, not user input, reducing risk. There are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The logging provides exception details but no sensitive information. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, modular pipeline management utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filter pipeline management utility designed for extensibility and error resilience. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code. The dynamic import pattern is controlled and safe. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
