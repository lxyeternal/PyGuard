  "purpose": "The code is intended to define or include filters used in the Open edX platform.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from openedx_filters.filters import *'",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import statements could import various functions or classes, but no data flow is evident",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered a bad practice but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing everything from a module. No input handling, no output, no data processing. The version string is standard. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The use of a wildcard import may pose maintainability issues but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple and standard, with no suspicious activity or anomalies.",
