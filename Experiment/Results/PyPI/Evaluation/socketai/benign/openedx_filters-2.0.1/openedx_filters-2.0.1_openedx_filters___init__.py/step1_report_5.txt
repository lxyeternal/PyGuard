{
  "purpose": "The code defines filters for the Open edX platform by importing all components from the 'openedx_filters.filters' module and setting a version identifier.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from openedx_filters.filters import *'",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; import is static and version assignment is straightforward",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered poor practice but does not inherently indicate malicious intent; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code only imports all contents from a local module and sets a version string. There are no data inputs, external communications, or complex logic. The import statement does not suggest malicious activity; it is standard in Python packages to import modules. The version string is a simple identifier. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization snippet with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It merely imports necessary components and sets a version, with no evident security risks.",
