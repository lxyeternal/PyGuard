{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define filters for the Open edX platform, likely importing filtering functionalities from an external module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from openedx_filters.filters import *'",
  "sinks": "Potentially used in the application where imported filters are applied; no explicit sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of external module; no explicit data flow or untrusted input handling in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal, importing a module and setting a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module docstring, an import statement importing all contents from 'openedx_filters.filters', and a version string assignment. There are no suspicious functions, code execution, or data handling visible. The import statement could potentially load complex or malicious code if the external module is malicious, but based solely on this snippet, there is no direct malicious activity. The code appears standard for a module setup with versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior. Its security risk is minimal, assuming the external 'openedx_filters' module is trustworthy.",
