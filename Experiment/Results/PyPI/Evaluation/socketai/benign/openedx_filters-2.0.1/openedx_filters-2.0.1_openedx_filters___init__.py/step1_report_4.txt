  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports a module and sets version",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'openxedx_filters.filters' and defines a version string. There are no functions, data processing, or network interactions. The import could potentially include malicious code if the module itself is compromised, but from this snippet alone, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The version string is standard and unremarkable.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with a version identifier. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is evident within this snippet.",
