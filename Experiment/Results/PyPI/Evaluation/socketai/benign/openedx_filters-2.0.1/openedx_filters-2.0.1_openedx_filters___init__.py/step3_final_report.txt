  "purpose": "Import filters from the external 'openedx_filters' module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from openedx_filters.filters import *' reads all contents from the external module; the version string '__version__' is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "The import source flows into the namespace, but there are no further data flows or operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('import *') is generally discouraged as it can lead to namespace pollution, but it does not constitute malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a docstring, a wildcard import from an external module, and a version string. There are no runtime operations, data handling, or network activity. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'openedx_filters' module, which cannot be assessed here. The wildcard import could be risky if the module is malicious, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The code itself is straightforward and benign. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing a standard import and version assignment. There is no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main risk lies in trusting the external module, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The current scores are justified; no adjustments are necessary.",
