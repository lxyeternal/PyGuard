  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'openedx_filters' package, handling version extraction, requirements loading, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py', requirements from specified files, and package metadata from README and CHANGELOG files.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system() to execute 'git' commands for tagging and pushing tags when run with the 'tag' argument.",
  "flows": "Version info and requirements are processed from files; os.system() executes commands based on command-line arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() for executing git commands, which could be risky if inputs are manipulated, but in this code, commands are static and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup utility with regex parsing for version and requirements, and standard package configuration. The only potential risk is executing shell commands via os.system(), which is controlled here. No malicious, obfuscated, or backdoor code is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2) are consistent with the controlled use of system calls and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent. The main concern is the use of system calls, which is common in such scripts but should be used cautiously. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present.",
