  "purpose": "Unit test to verify the sanity of callable metadata in NotificationCenter module",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport' and 'NotificationCenter'",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data output, network communication, or external data handling",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; test method performs a self-contained assertion",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the test appears straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support module and a NotificationCenter module, then defines a test case that calls a function to verify callable metadata. No external input, data leakage, or network activity is present. The test is self-contained and uses standard testing practices. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and normal within its scope.",
