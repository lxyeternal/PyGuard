  "purpose": "Unit test to verify the sanity of callable metadata in NotificationCenter module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules and the class definition calling test methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and invokes a test method; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The test appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and NotificationCenter modules, then defines a test class with a single test method. The test method calls 'assertCallableMetadataIsSane' on NotificationCenter. This seems to verify internal callable metadata for correctness. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage is evident. The code is straightforward and typical for a test suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply verifies callable metadata integrity within the NotificationCenter module. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
