  "purpose": "Unit test for NotificationCenter module's callable metadata sanity check",
  "sources": "Import statements for PyObjCTools.TestSupport and NotificationCenter",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs a test invocation",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code calls a test method without input processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; simple test code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support module and a NotificationCenter module, then defines a test case class with a single test method that invokes 'assertCallableMetadataIsSane' on NotificationCenter. This appears to be a straightforward unit test for internal consistency. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or data leaks are present. The code is standard for a test suite and does not include any external data handling or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations or leak information.",
