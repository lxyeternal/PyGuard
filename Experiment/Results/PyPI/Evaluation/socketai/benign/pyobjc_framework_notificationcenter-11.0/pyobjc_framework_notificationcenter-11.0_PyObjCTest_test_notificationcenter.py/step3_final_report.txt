  "purpose": "Verify callable metadata of NotificationCenter module via a unit test.",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and NotificationCenter.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; test invokes internal assertion.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward test with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, self-contained unit test that imports testing utilities and NotificationCenter, then verifies callable metadata using assertCallableMetadataIsSane. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risks (~0.1), which is appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for internal callable metadata validation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
