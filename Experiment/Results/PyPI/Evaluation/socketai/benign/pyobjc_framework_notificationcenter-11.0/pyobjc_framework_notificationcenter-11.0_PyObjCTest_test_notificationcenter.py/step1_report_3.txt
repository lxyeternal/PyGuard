  "purpose": "Unit test for NotificationCenter module, checking callable metadata sanity.",
  "sources": "Import statements for PyObjCTools.TestSupport and NotificationCenter modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is solely calling a test assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; straightforward test case.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and NotificationCenter, then runs a single test method that asserts the integrity of callable metadata within the NotificationCenter module. The code performs a standard unit test with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious operations. It is typical for testing scripts and shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign unit test script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a standard validation of the NotificationCenter module's callable metadata without any suspicious code or data flows.",
