  "purpose": "Unit tests for macOS NotificationCenter widget protocols, constants, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports from objc, NotificationCenter, and PyObjCTools.TestSupport; class definitions and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network communication, or data leaks; primarily API validation and assertions.",
  "flows": "Verification of enum types, constants, class existence, and method signatures without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward API testing code with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for NotificationCenter widget protocols, verifying constants, class existence, and method signatures. It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, well-structured testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign unit testing suite for macOS NotificationCenter widget protocols, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
