{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test module for macOS Notification Center widget protocols and classes, mainly used for testing and validation of API behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports objc, NotificationCenter modules, and defines helper classes/methods that do not process external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; no network or sensitive data processing is observed.",
  "flows": "The code does not process untrusted data; it only sets up method signatures and constants for testing purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code primarily tests API conformance and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system and NotificationCenter modules, defines a helper class with stub methods related to widget updates and margins, and a test class that verifies enum types, constants, class existence, and method signatures. All functions are standard for unit testing Notification Center widget protocols and contain no external data handling, network operations, or malicious logic. The code does not perform any data leakage, system modifications, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a legitimate test suite for API compliance without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test module for Notification Center widget API validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly verifies protocol conformance and method signatures in a controlled testing environment.",
