  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as unit tests for NotificationCenter framework, which matches the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or untrusted input handling; the code is test assertions and method signature validation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate. The confidence level (0.9) is appropriate, and malware/security risk scores are zero.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines a helper class for testing NotificationCenter widget interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing; purely class/method definitions and assertions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is consistent. The security risk score is 0.1, possibly reflecting minimal inherent risk in test code, which is reasonable.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a test suite for NotificationCenter widget protocols.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or malicious activities.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The high confidence (1.0) is justified; malware and security risk scores are zero.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a unit test module for macOS Notification Center.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or untrusted input processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious behaviors; standard API validation code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines a helper class and test cases for Notification Center widget protocols.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or malicious activities.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion is consistent; no malicious or security risks.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** Given that this is test code interacting solely with system frameworks and performing no external data processing, the risk scores of 0 or 0.1 are appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk in test code, but not a security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign unit test suite for macOS NotificationCenter widget protocols, with no malicious or security issues detected.",
