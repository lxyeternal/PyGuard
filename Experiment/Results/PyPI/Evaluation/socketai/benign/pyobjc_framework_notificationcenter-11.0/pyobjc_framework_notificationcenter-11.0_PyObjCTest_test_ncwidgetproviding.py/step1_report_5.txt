{
  "purpose": "The code defines a helper class for a Notification Center widget, including method implementations and test cases for macOS notification center widget protocols.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules, class definitions, and method parameters; no external input sources or data inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network or file I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines methods and test assertions without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code appears to be standard test code for Cocoa/Objective-C bridge classes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Objective-C bridging modules and testing utilities, defines a helper class implementing widget protocol methods, and a test class verifying enum types, constants, and protocol method signatures. The code uses standard patterns for macOS development with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It lacks network communication, data leakage, or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test code for macOS Notification Center widget protocols and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
