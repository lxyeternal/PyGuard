{
  "purpose": "The code defines a helper class for testing the NotificationCenter widget interface on macOS, implementing protocol methods and constants for widget behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports objc, NotificationCenter, and TestSupport modules; reads data from imported modules and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any network, file, or system modification actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines classes and tests protocol methods without external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code appears to be standard unit testing setup for macOS NotificationCenter widgets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for Objective-C bridging and NotificationCenter testing. It defines a helper class implementing specific widget protocol methods, mainly returning default or fixed values. Test cases verify enum types, constants, class existence, and method signatures. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or malicious code execution. The code's structure is typical for unit testing macOS NotificationCenter widget protocols. No suspicious or malicious actions, network activities, or credential handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing suite for NotificationCenter widget protocols on macOS with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It purely defines test helpers and performs protocol conformance checks without any suspicious activities.",
