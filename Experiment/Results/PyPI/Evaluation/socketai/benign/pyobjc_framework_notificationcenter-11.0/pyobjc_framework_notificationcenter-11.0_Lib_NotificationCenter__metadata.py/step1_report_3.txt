{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata and method signatures for Objective-C classes and selectors, likely for use in inter-language bridging or runtime introspection within an Objective-C environment, possibly related to widget management.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.maxsize, objc.arch, and the methods registered via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include the registration of method metadata which could be manipulated for malicious method hooking or runtime behavior alteration.",
  "flows": "Input data such as sys.maxsize and objc.arch influence which functions are used; registration calls set up method metadata based on these conditions, which could be exploited if tampered with.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic method registration and conditional functions based on system architecture; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures; the code is primarily metadata setup with no apparent malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script defines environment-dependent functions to select between values based on system architecture and pointer size, then registers multiple method signatures for Objective-C classes, likely for runtime method hooking or metadata management. All method registrations appear to be standard and related to widget management, with no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or backdoors. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or untrusted input handling that could indicate malicious intent. It seems to be a legitimate setup for Objective-C runtime interfacing, with careful conditional logic for different architectures, and does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for Objective-C method metadata registration, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs environment-based configuration and registers widget-related methods without any suspicious activity.",
