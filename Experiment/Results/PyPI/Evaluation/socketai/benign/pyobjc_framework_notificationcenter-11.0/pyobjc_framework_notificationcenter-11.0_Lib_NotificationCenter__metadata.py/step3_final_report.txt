{
  "purpose": "The code registers Objective-C method metadata for widget controllers and related classes, setting up method signatures and behaviors based on system architecture and environment.",
  "sources": "Reads system architecture info (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), static registration calls for Objective-C selectors and classes.",
  "sinks": "objc.registerMetaDataForSelector function, which registers method metadata; no untrusted data or external input flows into critical functions.",
  "flows": "System architecture checks determine function definitions; registration functions are called with static data; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors. The code is straightforward configuration for Objective-C runtime.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-dependent definitions and registers method metadata for widget-related classes using standard Objective-C runtime functions. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident. The code is static, controlled, and aligns with typical system setup routines. No external data sources or network activity are involved. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting its benign configuration nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Objective-C runtime setup script for widget classes, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
