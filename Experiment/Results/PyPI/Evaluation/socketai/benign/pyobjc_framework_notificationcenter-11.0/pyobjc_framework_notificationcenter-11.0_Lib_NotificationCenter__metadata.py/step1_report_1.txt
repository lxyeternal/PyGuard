{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and register metadata for Objective-C classes and selectors, likely for use in interfacing with macOS/iOS frameworks, particularly related to widget controllers.",
  "sources": "Imports 'objc' and 'sys', reads system architecture info (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), accesses module attributes, and reads embedded metadata strings.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'objc.registerMetaDataForSelector' to register metadata for various Objective-C selectors; no data is directly sent or received in a network or filesystem context.",
  "flows": "System info (sys.maxsize, objc.arch) influences function definitions; metadata registration calls provide data to the Objective-C runtime, configuring method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code is straightforward and appears to be configuration/setup code. No suspicious function calls or data handling observed. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script checks system architecture to define selector functions, then registers numerous Objective-C method metadata related to widget controllers. The metadata registration is extensive but appears standard for interfacing with macOS/iOS frameworks. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is primarily setup/configuration for Objective-C runtime interactions, with no user input handling, network operations, or file manipulations. Overall, the code is benign and appears to be part of a framework or library initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Objective-C metadata registration, with no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage. It mainly facilitates interaction with system frameworks and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
