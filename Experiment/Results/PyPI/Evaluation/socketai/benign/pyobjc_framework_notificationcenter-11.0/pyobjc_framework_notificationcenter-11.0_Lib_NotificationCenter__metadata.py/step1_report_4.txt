{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and register metadata for Objective-C classes and selectors, likely for use in a macOS or iOS environment, related to widget controllers and view controllers.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), importing modules (objc, sys), and registration functions (objc.registerMetaDataForSelector).",
  "sinks": "Registration calls to objc.registerMetaDataForSelector potentially influence runtime behavior, but no direct data sinks or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "System info (sys.maxsize, objc.arch) → Conditional function definitions → Metadata registration calls (objc.registerMetaDataForSelector).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; code primarily performs configuration and registration. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines simple selector functions based on system architecture and Python runtime info. It updates a 'misc' dictionary with type definitions. The core activity involves calling objc.registerMetaDataForSelector to register method metadata for Objective-C classes, such as NCWidgetController and NSObject. The registration data specifies method argument types, return types, and some flags. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are present. The code appears to be a legitimate setup for Objective-C method metadata registration in a macOS/iOS context.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign configuration script that registers Objective-C method metadata. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs expected setup tasks without suspicious or malicious intent.",
