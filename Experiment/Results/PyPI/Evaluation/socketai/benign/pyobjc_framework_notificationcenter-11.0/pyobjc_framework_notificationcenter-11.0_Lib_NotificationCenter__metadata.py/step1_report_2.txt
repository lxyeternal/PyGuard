{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata registration for Objective-C classes and selectors related to widgets, likely for a macOS or iOS environment, for UI or widget management purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (`sys.maxsize`, `objc.arch`) and defines functions based on this. It also reads various constants and enums for Objective-C method registration. It obtains data via `sys` and `objc` modules, especially during `registerMetaDataForSelector` calls.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the `objc.registerMetaDataForSelector` function, which registers method metadata; potential vulnerabilities depend on the nature of the data fed into these registration calls. No explicit external untrusted input appears to influence this data directly.",
  "flows": "Source: System info (`sys.maxsize`, `objc.arch`) -> Conditional function definitions. Also, the flow from reading constants/enums -> registering method metadata via `registerMetaDataForSelector`. These flows are straightforward and controlled, with no untrusted data flow visible.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code uses platform-specific checks and Objective-C metadata registration, which is typical for such environment setup. No backdoors, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up Objective-C method metadata for certain classes and selectors, which is standard in environment initialization or framework extensions. It conditionally defines functions based on system architecture. The registration of method metadata appears explicit and controlled, with no dynamic or untrusted data injection. The constants and enums are static. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors, are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for such system integrations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for Objective-C class and method metadata registration related to widget management, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not involve untrusted data or external network activity, and its structure aligns with normal environment configuration routines.",
