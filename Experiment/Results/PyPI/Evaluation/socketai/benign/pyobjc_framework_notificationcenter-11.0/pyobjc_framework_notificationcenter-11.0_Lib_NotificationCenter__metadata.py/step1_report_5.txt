{
  "purpose": "The code is used to register Objective-C method metadata for various widget-related classes and selectors, likely for interfacing with macOS or iOS system APIs.",
  "sources": "Reading system architecture information via 'sys.maxsize' and 'objc.arch', importing 'objc' and 'sys' modules, and data within 'constants', 'enums', and 'misc' variables.",
  "sinks": "Method registration calls via 'objc.registerMetaDataForSelector' which define method signatures and metadata, potentially used to invoke system APIs or manipulate Objective-C classes.",
  "flows": "Source: system info ('sys', 'objc') → 'objc.registerMetaDataForSelector' calls → metadata registration (including method signatures).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows detected. The code performs standard system API interfacing and metadata registration without unusual or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code checks system architecture and register metadata for Objective-C selectors related to widget management, editing, and search functionalities. It uses conditional definitions based on system architecture, then registers various method signatures with the Objective-C runtime. The 'try-finally' block ensures that metadata updates are correctly wrapped. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data manipulation, or malicious payloads. The purpose appears to be standard Objective-C API interfacing, typical in macOS/iOS development. No suspicious activities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Objective-C metadata registration script used for widget interface management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its functions are consistent with normal API interfacing tasks.",
