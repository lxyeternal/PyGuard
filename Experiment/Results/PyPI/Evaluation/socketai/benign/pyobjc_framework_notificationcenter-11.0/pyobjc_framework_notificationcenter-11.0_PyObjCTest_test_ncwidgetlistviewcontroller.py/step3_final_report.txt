{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for NotificationCenter's NCWidgetListViewController and its delegate protocol, verifying class types, method signatures, and protocol conformance.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from class definitions, method signatures, and protocol declarations within the testing framework.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code performs internal assertions only.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to internal method calls and assertions verifying class types and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. Delegate methods are simple stubs returning static values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for Objective-C classes and protocols exposed via PyObjC. It performs validation of class types, method signatures, and protocol existence without external data handling or system modifications. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The delegate helper methods are straightforward, serving as mocks for testing purposes. Overall, the code is benign and intended for framework validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
