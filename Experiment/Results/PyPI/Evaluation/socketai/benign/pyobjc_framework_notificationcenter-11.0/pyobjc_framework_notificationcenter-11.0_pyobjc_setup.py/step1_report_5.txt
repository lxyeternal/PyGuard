  "purpose": "The code provides setup and build configurations for the PyObjC framework wrappers, including custom build commands, test runners, and SDK detection utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS, PATH), subprocess outputs (e.g., sw_vers, clang, xcrun), file system contents (e.g., SDKSettings.plist, header files), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of subprocess outputs (e.g., executing sw_vers, clang, xcrun) without validation; file read/write operations; manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules; subprocess calls for compiler verification.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → subprocess commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun) → file operations (reading SDK info, writing build info) → sys.path modifications; user-supplied options influencing build parameters; test suite loading from modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to invoke system commands for system info (e.g., sw_vers, clang, xcrun) with minimal validation; dynamic modification of sys.path and sys.modules; inclusion of test files based on filename patterns; no explicit validation of external input beyond environment variables; potential for command injection via environment variables (e.g., PATH).",
  "analysis": "The code performs system-level detection (macOS version, SDK paths) and modifies build configurations based on environment and system info. It dynamically adjusts compiler flags and paths, and loads test modules from filesystem patterns. The subprocess calls execute system commands but do not parse outputs in a way that could execute untrusted code; however, they rely on external system tools. The script manipulates sys.path and modules to include test code, which is standard for test frameworks but could be exploited if malicious test files are present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads are detected. Overall, the code appears intended for development and build processes, with some risk associated with subprocess and environment variable handling, but no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical build and test setup for a Python framework with system info retrieval, build customization, and test discovery. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The use of subprocess commands is standard for system detection but should be considered with normal security precautions. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
