  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a build/test setup script that uses environment variables, subprocess calls, and filesystem reads.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls for system info; file writes for build info; dynamic import of test modules.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses subprocess for system info gathering (sw_vers, clang, xcrun). No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The dynamic test discovery and environment modifications are standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; functions as a typical build script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, due to system info gathering)  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup script, with environment variables, subprocess calls, and filesystem operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** System info via subprocess; dynamic test loading; environment and sys.path modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Heavy reliance on subprocess for system info, but all are standard commands. No suspicious code patterns or secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard build/test script; no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still low; justified given system info calls)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; no change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a setup script for build/test, with environment detection and dynamic test loading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls for system info; file reads for SDK info; dynamic import of tests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses subprocess for system info, which is standard. No malicious code or secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script; no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; no change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build/test setup, with environment detection and SDK info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls, filesystem reads, dynamic module imports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard use of subprocess for system info; no suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign setup script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; no change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—build/test setup, environment detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** System commands, file reads, dynamic imports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses subprocess for system info; no malicious code or secrets. Some risk in subprocess reliance, but standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical build script, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; no change.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected. All subprocess calls are for system info, which is standard.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, justified by the use of subprocess and environment info gathering, which are common in build scripts.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's behavior. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard build script behavior)\n\nThis code is a typical, benign setup and build script for a Python extension package, with no signs of malicious activity.",
