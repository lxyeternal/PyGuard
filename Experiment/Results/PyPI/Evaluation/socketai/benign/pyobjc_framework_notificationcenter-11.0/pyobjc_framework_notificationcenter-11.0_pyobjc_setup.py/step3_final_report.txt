{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup, build, and test framework for the PyObjC Python extension, handling environment detection, SDK info retrieval, and dynamic test discovery.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS), subprocess calls for system info (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), filesystem reads (SDKSettings.plist), dynamic import of test modules, sys.path modifications.",
  "sinks": "System commands executed via subprocess, file writes for build info, dynamic import of test modules, modifications to sys.path and sys.modules, filesystem operations for SDK info.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build flags; subprocess outputs provide system and SDK info; filesystem reads supply SDK details; dynamic imports load test modules based on discovered files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess for system info gathering is standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; no network activity or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical environment detection and build setup tasks using subprocess calls for system info, filesystem reads for SDK details, and dynamic module loading for tests. All subprocess commands are standard system queries (sw_vers, clang, xcrun). No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The code's behavior aligns with expected build/test procedures, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign build and test setup script for PyObjC, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
