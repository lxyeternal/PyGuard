  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the NotificationCenter framework wrapper on macOS using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reads module files from the 'Modules' directory to include dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no network or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Dynamically lists files in 'Modules' to configure dependencies during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses directory listing which could be manipulated if the directory is compromised, but this is standard in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python extension package. It imports necessary modules, sets versioning, and dynamically includes module files from the 'Modules' directory. No user input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The dynamic listing of files could be exploited if the directory is maliciously controlled, but this does not constitute malicious behavior by itself. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward setup script for packaging a macOS framework wrapper. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The slight security risk score (0.1) in one report due to directory listing is justified but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
