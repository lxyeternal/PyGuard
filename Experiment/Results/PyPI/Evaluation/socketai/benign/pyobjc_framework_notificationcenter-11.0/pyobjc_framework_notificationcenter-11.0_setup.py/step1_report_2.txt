{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that provides wrappers for the NotificationCenter framework on macOS, intended for installation and distribution via package managers.",
  "sources": "Reading the script itself; importing modules, reading files from the 'Modules' directory",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed in a harmful manner",
  "flows": "The script reads module files from a directory, constructs an extension, and passes data for package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The script dynamically reads filenames from the 'Modules' directory, which could potentially be manipulated if an attacker controls that directory, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for packaging a macOS framework wrapper. It imports necessary modules, dynamically constructs a list of dependencies based on files in a directory, and calls 'setup' to prepare the package. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The dynamic listing of files is typical for such scripts and does not appear malicious. There are no obfuscated parts, suspicious network calls, or malicious code. Overall, the code performs a legitimate package setup process with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for packaging macOS framework wrappers with no malicious behavior detected. It reads files from a directory to configure the build, which is standard. There is no indication of malware or security risks.",
