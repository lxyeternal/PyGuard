  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing a Python wrapper for the macOS NotificationCenter framework using pyobjc.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine the current directory, os.listdir('Modules') to list module dependencies, and os.path.join for path construction.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is directly used in a way that affects system security or leaks data.",
  "flows": "The code reads its own directory to find module dependencies, then configures a build process with those dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is a straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a build process for a Python extension module using the pyobjc framework. It dynamically lists dependencies from the 'Modules' directory, constructs paths, and prepares the extension build configuration. No user input, environment variables, or network communication is involved. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The code functions as intended for packaging purposes without performing any potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for building a Python extension module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
