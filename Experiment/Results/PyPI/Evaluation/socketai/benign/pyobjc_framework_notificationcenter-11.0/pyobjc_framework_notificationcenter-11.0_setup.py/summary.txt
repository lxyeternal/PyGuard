  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward setup script for packaging a macOS framework wrapper. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The slight security risk score (0.1) in one report due to directory listing is justified but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate."
