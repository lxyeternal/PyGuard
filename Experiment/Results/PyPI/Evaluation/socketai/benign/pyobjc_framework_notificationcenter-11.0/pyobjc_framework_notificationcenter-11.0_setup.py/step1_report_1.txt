{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package for macOS NotificationCenter framework wrappers using PyObjC, primarily for building and installing the package.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), __doc__",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks data",
  "flows": "Reads the directory listing of 'Modules' to determine dependencies, uses os.path and __file__ for paths, and includes setup configurations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; standard setup script for a Python extension",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a PyObjC setup utility. It dynamically constructs dependency paths based on the 'Modules' directory and configures a C extension for macOS NotificationCenter framework. No user input, network activity, or data leaks are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are detected. The code adheres to typical setup script patterns for Python extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package wrapping macOS NotificationCenter. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
