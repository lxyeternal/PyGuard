  "purpose": "Test setup for NotificationCenter delegate protocol conformance and method signature verification.",
  "sources": "The method widgetSearch_searchForTerm_maxResults_ as a stub, and the class definitions that reference NotificationCenter and objc modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a stub method and performs protocol existence assertions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward test code with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class implementing a delegate method as a stub and a test class verifying protocol existence and method argument types. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code is typical for Objective-C protocol conformance testing via Python's PyObjC bridge. All signals indicate benign, testing-only code with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign testing scaffold for Objective-C protocol conformance. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe, testing nature.",
