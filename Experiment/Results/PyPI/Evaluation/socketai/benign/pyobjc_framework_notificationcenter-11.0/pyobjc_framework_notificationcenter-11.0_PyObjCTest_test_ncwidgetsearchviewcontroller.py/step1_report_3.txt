{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for a macOS Notification Center widget delegate, verifying protocol existence and method signatures.",
  "sources": "import statements, class definitions, method definitions, assertions within test methods",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; code mainly performs introspection and assertions",
  "flows": "Input sources are primarily the test framework and method parameters; flow is limited to internal method calls and assertions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; method implementations are placeholders, which is typical for test code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class with a method matching a delegate protocol expected in NotificationCenter widgets, and a test class that verifies the existence of the protocol and correct method signatures. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The code is standard for Objective-C bridge testing in Python using PyObjC, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for verifying Notification Center widget delegate protocols and methods. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
