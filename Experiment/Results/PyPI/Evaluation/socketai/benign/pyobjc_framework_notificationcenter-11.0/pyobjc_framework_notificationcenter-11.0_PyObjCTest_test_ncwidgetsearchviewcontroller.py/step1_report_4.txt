  "purpose": "Define a helper class for testing Notification Center widget search view delegate methods and verify protocol existence and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Import statements for testing framework, objc, and NotificationCenter; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network calls, or data leaks; no external sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines classes and tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and Objective-C bridge modules, defines a helper class implementing a delegate method with no internal logic, and performs protocol and method signature tests. It operates within a testing environment, verifying protocol existence and method argument types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. The code is standard for Objective-C bridging tests in Python for macOS/iOS development.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for Notification Center widget delegate protocols, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
