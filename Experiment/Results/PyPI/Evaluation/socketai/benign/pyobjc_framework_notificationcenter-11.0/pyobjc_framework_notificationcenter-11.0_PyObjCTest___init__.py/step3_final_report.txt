  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment string 'Test suite' with no executable statements, functions, or data handling. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the code's nature. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments are consistent and accurate, with no need for adjustments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign comment with no executable or malicious content. All reports correctly conclude this, and the scoring reflects the absence of security concerns. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
