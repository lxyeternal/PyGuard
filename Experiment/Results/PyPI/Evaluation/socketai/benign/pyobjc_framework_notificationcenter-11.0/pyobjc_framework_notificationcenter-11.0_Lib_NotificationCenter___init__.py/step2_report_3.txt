  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs dynamic framework loading using `objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr`, which is a standard approach for bridging Objective-C frameworks in Python.\n- It modifies the global namespace by setting `__dir__` and `__getattr__` to custom functions, enabling dynamic attribute access.\n- It deletes internal modules from `sys.modules`, likely for cleanup.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is presented.\n- The operations are typical for system framework bindings, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1:\n- **Purpose:** Setup for NotificationCenter framework access.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior. Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) possibly due to dynamic code execution or namespace modifications, but these are standard for such bindings.\n\n### Issue 2:\n- **Purpose:** Similar framework setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning as above; no malicious intent detected.\n\n### Issue 3:\n- **Purpose:** Similar framework binding.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher security risk, perhaps due to the deletion of modules and dynamic attribute setup, but still within benign bounds.\n\n### Issue 4:\n- **Purpose:** Standard framework binding.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n### Issue 5:\n- **Purpose:** Framework setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; typical setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern mainly due to dynamic loading and namespace modifications, which are common in such binding code.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The risk scores could be uniformly set to 0.1 across all reports, as the slight differences are negligible and all operations are standard for system bindings.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1**\n\nThese reflect a benign, standard framework binding code with minimal security implications. The dynamic loading and namespace modifications are typical and do not constitute a security threat in this context.",
