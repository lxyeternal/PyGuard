{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads the NotificationCenter framework from macOS using Objective-C bridging, setting up attribute access functions and cleaning internal modules.",
  "sources": "Framework loading via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, global namespace modifications (__dir__, __getattr__), sys.modules cleanup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network activity, no system modifications beyond framework binding.",
  "flows": "Framework path and attributes loaded from system framework to global namespace; internal modules deleted; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation and namespace modification are typical in bindings but could be misused if untrusted inputs were involved. No actual malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard system framework binding for NotificationCenter on macOS. It employs dynamic attribute setup and cleans internal modules, which are common practices. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned across reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical system binding patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup for macOS framework access with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior. No further action is necessary.",
