{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to instantiate and load OpenAI models using credentials supplied at runtime, avoiding hardcoded secrets.",
  "sources": "Credentials are read from the input dictionary ('openai_api_base' and 'openai_api_key') during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "Credentials are used in the constructor of OpenAI models; no external data exfiltration or network activity within this code.",
  "flows": "Input credentials flow into the constructor method, which creates the model instance; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of external libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for loading OpenAI models with runtime credentials, ensuring no secrets are hardcoded. It uses standard patterns for dependency injection and model instantiation. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern outside this code is the secure management of credentials, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for such interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It securely handles credentials at runtime, with no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to external credential management outside this code. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
