  "purpose": "Define interfaces and datasets for accessing OpenAI models and embeddings using langchain, primarily for runtime credential handling and model instantiation.",
  "sources": "Credentials provided via constructor (`credentials` dict), used in `load()` method to instantiate models.",
  "sinks": "Potential model instantiation and API calls through langchain's OpenAI classes (`ChatOpenAI`, `OpenAIEmbeddings`) with provided credentials.",
  "flows": "Credentials input -> stored in class instance -> used in `load()` to instantiate langchain models -> potential API interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; credentials are passed at runtime. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable usage. No network calls within this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures and methods for loading OpenAI models with runtime credentials. It relies on external langchain classes (`ChatOpenAI`, `OpenAIEmbeddings`) to perform actual API requests. The credentials are passed explicitly during instantiation, avoiding hardcoded secrets. No code indicates malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with standard use of abstract classes, properties, and type hints. No suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a structured interface for loading OpenAI models with credentials provided at runtime, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a data access layer interacting with external APIs, with proper separation of concerns and no suspicious behaviors.",
