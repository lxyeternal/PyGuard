  "purpose": "Define interfaces for accessing OpenAI models and embeddings with runtime credentials.",
  "sources": "Credentials provided via constructor arguments, specifically 'openai_api_base' and 'openai_api_key'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of credentials to instantiate OpenAI API clients, which could be exploited if credentials are mishandled or leaked.",
  "flows": "Credentials flow from the constructor to the `constructor` method, which instantiates `OpenAIEmbeddings` or `ChatOpenAI` objects, potentially allowing API calls with provided credentials.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code constructs. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors observed. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract dataset class for OpenAI models and two specific dataset implementations for embeddings and chat models. It uses runtime credentials passed via a dictionary, which is standard. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious external calls or network activity within this code snippet. The design seems focused on configuration-based API client instantiation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration points. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows typical patterns for API client setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for configuring and instantiating OpenAI models using credentials passed at runtime. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. The credentials are only used to initialize API client objects, with no evidence of malicious data handling or backdoors.",
