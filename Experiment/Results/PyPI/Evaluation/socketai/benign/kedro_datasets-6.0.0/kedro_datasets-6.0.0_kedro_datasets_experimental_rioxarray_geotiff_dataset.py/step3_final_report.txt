  "purpose": "A class for loading and saving GeoTIFF raster data using rioxarray, rasterio, and xarray, with validation and filesystem management.",
  "sources": "File paths provided via fsspec, rasterio open calls, and metadata tags read during load.",
  "sinks": "Writing raster data to files via rasterio, updating metadata, and cache invalidation.",
  "flows": "File path resolution, data validation, reading tags, opening files, writing data, and cache invalidation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for geospatial raster data handling, performing validation of CRS and dimensions, and managing file I/O with external libraries. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. It uses reputable libraries and handles data securely. The validation logic is appropriate, and the filesystem interactions are standard for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured geospatial data handler with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the code adheres to best practices.",
