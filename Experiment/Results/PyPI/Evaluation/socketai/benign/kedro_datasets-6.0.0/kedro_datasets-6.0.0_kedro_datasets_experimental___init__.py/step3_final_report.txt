{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be involved in data processing or utility functions, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, possibly external inputs or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sinks include system commands or network transmission if data is unsanitized.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks, possibly through functions or methods that handle external data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation hints, dynamic code execution patterns, or complex control flows suggest suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential unsafe data handling, but no concrete malicious activity such as network exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or system damage is confirmed. The suspicion is based on pattern recognition rather than direct evidence. Confidence is moderate (0.6), malware likelihood is low (0.2), obfuscation suspicion is moderate (0.2), and overall security risk is low to moderate (0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit definitive malicious behavior but contains some obfuscation and suspicious patterns that warrant cautious monitoring. The malware score is set low due to lack of concrete evidence, and the overall security risk remains low.",
