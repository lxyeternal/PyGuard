  "sources": "Input data could come from user inputs, environment variables, or external files/read operations if present. However, the code snippet is missing, so specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network communications, file writes, or system commands if present. No specific sinks can be identified without the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through function calls, data processing steps, or network transmissions. Cannot determine exact flows without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns can be detected without the actual code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform a step-by-step analysis due to lack of provided code. Typically, analysis involves identifying sources, sinks, data flows, anomalies, and reviewing the structure for malicious patterns. Here, insufficient data prevents detailed analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the presence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code snippet is missing, preventing a thorough review.",
