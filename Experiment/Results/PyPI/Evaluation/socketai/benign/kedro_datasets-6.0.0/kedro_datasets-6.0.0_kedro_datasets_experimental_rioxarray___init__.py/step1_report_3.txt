  "purpose": "Define an abstract class for loading and saving geospatial raster data, utilizing lazy loading for dependencies.",
  "sources": "The import of 'lazy_loader' as 'lazy' and the lazy attachment of 'GeoTIFFDataset'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up lazy loading of a dataset class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy loading is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a lazy loader module and sets up an abstract dataset class with deferred import of 'GeoTIFFDataset'. This is a typical pattern to reduce initial load time or manage optional dependencies. No user input handling, network communication, or file operations are present. No obfuscated code features or malicious patterns are identified. The lazy import approach is not suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for abstract dataset management with lazy loading. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
