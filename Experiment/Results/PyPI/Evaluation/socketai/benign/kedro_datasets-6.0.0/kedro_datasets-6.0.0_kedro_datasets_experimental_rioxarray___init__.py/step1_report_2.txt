  "purpose": "Define a placeholder for a geospatial raster dataset class and dynamically load its implementation using lazy loading.",
  "sources": "import statements, lazy_loader usage",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input handling or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy_loader for dynamic attribute attachment; no explicit security issues or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and a third-party lazy_loader module to delay the import of a potentially large or optional geospatial dataset class. It defines a placeholder 'GeoTIFFDataset' and uses lazy.attach to bind the module's attributes dynamically, likely improving load performance. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No sensitive data handling, network activity, or suspicious obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for lazy loading of a geospatial dataset class, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign and common pattern used for performance optimization.",
