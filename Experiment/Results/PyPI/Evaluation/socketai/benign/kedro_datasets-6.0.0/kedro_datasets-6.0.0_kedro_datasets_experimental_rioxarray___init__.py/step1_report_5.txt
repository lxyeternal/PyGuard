{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract dataset class for geospatial raster files with lazy loading of dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code imports a future feature, typing.Any, and a lazy_loader library; it also assigns an attribute via lazy.attach.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data input, no data leaks, no code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy_loader for dynamic attribute attachment is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for annotations, uses standard typing for type hints, and relies on a third-party 'lazy_loader' to defer importing 'GeoTIFFDataset'. The lazy.attach function dynamically attaches 'GeoTIFFDataset' as an attribute, likely to optimize import times. There are no functions, no untrusted input sources, no suspicious code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard pattern for lazy loading dependencies with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a lazy loader setup for a geospatial dataset class, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is a typical pattern for performance optimization and does not pose security risks.",
