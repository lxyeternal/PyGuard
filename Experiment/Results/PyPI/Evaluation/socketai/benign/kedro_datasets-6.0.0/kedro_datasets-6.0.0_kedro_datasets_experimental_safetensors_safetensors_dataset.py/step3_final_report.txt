  "purpose": "A Kedro dataset class for loading and saving safetensors files supporting multiple backends and filesystems, with dynamic backend module import.",
  "sources": "User-supplied 'backend' parameter, file path, filesystem open calls",
  "sinks": "Filesystem open/write operations, dynamic import of backend modules",
  "flows": "Initialization with backend parameter -> importlib.import_module(f\"safetensors.{self._backend}\") -> load/save methods calling imported backend functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on external input without explicit validation, no input sanitization for 'backend'",
  "analysis": "The code implements a plugin-based data handler for safetensors files, supporting multiple backends and filesystems via fsspec. It dynamically imports backend modules based on the 'backend' parameter, which could be exploited if untrusted input is provided. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. Exception handling is appropriate. The main security concern is the dynamic import, which, if environment is trusted and inputs validated, poses minimal risk. The code's structure and behavior are standard for such a plugin system. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's logic and potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured plugin for safetensors data serialization. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The primary security consideration is ensuring that the 'backend' parameter is validated or restricted to prevent malicious module import. The low security risk score is justified given the controlled environment assumption.",
