{
  "purpose": "A simple Python script that detects the Python version and runs doctest on a documentation file appropriate for the environment, reporting failures and exiting with status 0 or 1 accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads static documentation files ('docs/quickstart.txt' or 'docs/quickstart_python2.txt') based on Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "Outputs failure counts to stdout; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Detects Python version -> selects file -> runs doctest.testfile() -> reports failures -> exits with status code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, runs doctest on static documentation files, reports failures, and exits accordingly. It uses only standard libraries and static files, with no network activity, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The logic is clear, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward utility for testing documentation correctness. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
