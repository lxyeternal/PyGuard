{
  "purpose": "To run doctest on documentation files depending on Python version and exit with appropriate status.",
  "sources": "Reading system information from sys.version_info; reading files 'docs/quickstart.txt' or 'docs/quickstart_python2.txt'.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to unsafe operations; the only output is printed status messages and process exit codes.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info check determines which file to test; doctest.testfile reads the specified documentation file; based on results, prints status and exits.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard version check and test execution.",
  "analysis": "The code determines Python version and runs doctest on version-specific documentation files. It then reports the number of failures and exits with an error code if any tests fail. No input validation, external data processing, or system commands are involved. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The process relies solely on standard library modules and straightforward control flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe testing script for documentation files with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
