  "purpose": "This script runs doctests from documentation files depending on Python version, to validate documentation examples.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python documentation files 'docs/quickstart.txt' or 'docs/quickstart_python2.txt' using doctest.testfile.",
  "sinks": "Outputs test failure information to standard output and exits with a status code based on test results.",
  "flows": "Reads documentation files -> Processes tests via doctest -> Reports failures -> Exits with status code.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic selection of test file based on Python version; no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, determines Python version, runs doctest on specific documentation files, and exits with appropriate status. No input from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no data leakage or malicious commands are present. The logic is straightforward, focused solely on testing documentation examples. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard testing utility for documentation examples, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
