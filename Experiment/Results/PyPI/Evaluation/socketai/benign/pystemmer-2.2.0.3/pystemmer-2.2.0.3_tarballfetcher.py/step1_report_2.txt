{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a tarball file from a given URL, verifies its SHA256 checksum if provided, and extracts it.",
  "sources": "Reads the URL from input parameters, reads the tarball file from disk, reads the file to compute SHA256.",
  "sinks": "Uses urlretrieve to download data, reads file contents for hashing, writes output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Download URL → Save file → Read file for checksum verification → Extract file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Uses standard libraries only. No obfuscated code detected. No network connections other than downloading are initiated.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file download, checksum verification, and extraction operations. It verifies the integrity of downloaded files via SHA256. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No malicious network activity or malicious code injection detected. Usage of standard libraries reduces suspicion. The code appears to be a utility for securely downloading and extracting files, with proper checksum validation. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for downloading, verifying, and extracting tarball files. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate purposes.",
