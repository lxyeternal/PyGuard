{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a tarball file from a URL, verifies its SHA256 checksum, and extracts its contents.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the URL parameter in download_file() and download_and_extract_tarball() functions, and the tarball filename derived from URL or provided directly.",
  "sinks": "File system (saving downloaded file, extracting archive), checksum comparison, and process termination on checksum mismatch.",
  "flows": "Download URL -> save file -> verify checksum -> extract archive.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of sys.exit(1) on checksum failure is normal but could halt execution unexpectedly. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles file downloading, checksum verification, and archive extraction. It uses standard libraries and methods. No user input is directly processed, reducing risk. The checksum verification adds integrity assurance. The only notable behavior is terminating the process if checksum verification fails, which is standard for integrity checks. No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for downloading, verifying, and extracting tarball files, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It adheres to good practices for integrity verification.",
