  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured setup process for the PyStemmer package, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external dependency management is standard, and the overall security posture is sound. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given the reliance on external downloads, but no active threats are present."
