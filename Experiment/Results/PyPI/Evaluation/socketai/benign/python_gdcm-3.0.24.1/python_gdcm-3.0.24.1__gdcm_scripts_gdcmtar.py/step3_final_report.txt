{
  "purpose": "A wrapper script that executes an internal '_gdcm' binary with user-supplied command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (user input), gdcm.__file__ (module path)",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call(command) (executes external command with user input)",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] flows directly into subprocess.call() without validation",
  "anomalies": "No input validation or sanitization; straightforward command execution",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a command from the gdcm module path and user arguments, then executes it via subprocess.call(). No validation of user input is performed, which could lead to command injection if malicious arguments are supplied. The code is a benign wrapper, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The primary security concern is unvalidated input leading to potential command injection, but the code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign wrapper that executes an external binary with user input. It lacks input validation, posing a command injection risk if used improperly. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is the potential for command injection due to untrusted input.",
