{
  "purpose": "Wraps and executes the '_gdcm' binary associated with the gdcm package, forwarding command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The script reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and the gdcm module's file location via gdcm.__file__.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.call() executes an external command constructed from the gdcm package path and script arguments.",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] (input arguments) -> command list -> subprocess.call() -> executes external '_gdcm' binary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. The script dynamically constructs and executes an external command.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the path of the gdcm module, constructs a command to run the '_gdcm' executable located relative to the module's path, and forwards any command-line arguments. This is a standard wrapper pattern. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The subprocess call executes an external binary, which is expected given the wrapper purpose, and does not inherently imply malicious intent. The script's behavior appears benign, simply relaying commands to an underlying executable.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a wrapper to invoke a gdcm-related binary with user-provided arguments. There are no signs of malicious activity, suspicious data leaks, or malware. Its purpose seems legitimate, relying on the trusted gdcm package, with no indicators of compromise.",
