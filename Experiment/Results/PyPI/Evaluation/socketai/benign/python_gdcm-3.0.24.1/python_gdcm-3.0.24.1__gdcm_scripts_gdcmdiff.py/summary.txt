  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple wrapper around a gdcm executable. While it does not contain malicious code, it has a security vulnerability due to unvalidated user input that could lead to command injection. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily from the potential for command injection if inputs are manipulated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a risk score of approximately 0.4–0.5 is justified."
