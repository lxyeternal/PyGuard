{
  "purpose": "Wraps the gdcm executable located within the package directory, executing it with user-provided arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv[1:]) and gdcm module file path (gdcm.__file__).",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executes the constructed command, which includes unvalidated user input.",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] (source) directly incorporated into the command passed to subprocess.call() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No input validation or sanitization on sys.argv; constructs command directly from user input.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically constructs a command to execute an internal gdcm-related binary, appending all user arguments without validation. This creates a potential command injection vector if malicious arguments are supplied. The code is straightforward, serving as a wrapper, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the lack of input sanitization, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands. No malware or backdoors are present, and the code structure is simple and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple wrapper around a gdcm executable. While it does not contain malicious code, it has a security vulnerability due to unvalidated user input that could lead to command injection. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily from the potential for command injection if inputs are manipulated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a risk score of approximately 0.4–0.5 is justified.",
