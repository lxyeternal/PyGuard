  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and then synthesize an overall security estimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script automates building GDCM with Python bindings, invoking standard build tools, copying XML files, and cleaning up. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the script uses common build practices, and no malicious activity is evident. The use of subprocess for external tools is typical in build scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build procedures with subprocess calls, environment handling, and file operations. No suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no malicious indicators. Subprocess calls are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on build automation, copying XML files, invoking CMake, and modifying shared libraries with patchelf or install_name_tool. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Validates that the script performs legitimate build tasks. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on environment variable handling, platform-specific build steps, and library patching. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (slightly higher, but still within normal build script risks)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to environment variable influence, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard build script with platform-specific adjustments, XML copying, and library patching. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports; no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports agree that the code is a legitimate build script.\n- **Use of subprocess:** Standard for build automation, with no evidence of malicious commands.\n- **Environment variables:** Used to configure build steps, which is normal but should be controlled in secure environments.\n- **External tools (patchelf, install_name_tool):** Used for shared library patching, common in such build processes.\n- **XML file copying:** Part of build data management, not suspicious.\n- **No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code:** Confirmed across reports.\n\n### Final Risk and Malware Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk:** Given the reliance on environment variables and external tools, a moderate risk (around 0.2-0.3) is reasonable. All reports align on this.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code performs complex but standard build automation tasks.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- External tools used are common in build environments, and their invocation appears legitimate.\n- Risks mainly stem from environment variable manipulation, which is inherent in build scripts but not malicious per se.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, straightforward build script.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — moderate, due to environment variable reliance and external tool invocation, but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and after careful review, I concur that this code is a legitimate build script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is typical for complex build systems but does not indicate malicious activity.",
