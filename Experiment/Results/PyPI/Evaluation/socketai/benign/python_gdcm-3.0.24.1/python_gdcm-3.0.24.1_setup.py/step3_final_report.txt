  "purpose": "Build automation script for the GDCM library with Python bindings, invoking CMake, patching shared libraries, copying XML files, and cleaning up build directories.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CMAKE_EXE, SWIG_EXE, CMAKE_ARGS, CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES), subprocess calls for build tools (cmake, patchelf, install_name_tool), file system operations (copying XML files, creating directories), platform-specific commands.",
  "sinks": "External build tools invoked via subprocess (cmake, patchelf, install_name_tool), copying and patching shared libraries, environment variable modifications.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands; source files (XML) copied into build directories; subprocess calls execute build steps; platform-specific commands modify shared libraries.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for executable paths and build flags, which could be manipulated externally; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected; code structure is standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script automates building the GDCM library with Python bindings using standard tools like CMake, patchelf, and install_name_tool. It copies necessary XML files, configures environment variables, and performs platform-specific library patching. All subprocess calls invoke legitimate build tools, and no suspicious or malicious code is present. The reliance on environment variables poses a typical risk if the environment is compromised, but this is common in build environments. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build automation script for the GDCM Python extension. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The primary security consideration is environment variable control, which is typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by environment reliance but no active malicious behavior.",
