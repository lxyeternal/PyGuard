  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build automation script for the GDCM Python extension. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The primary security consideration is environment variable control, which is typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by environment reliance but no active malicious behavior."
