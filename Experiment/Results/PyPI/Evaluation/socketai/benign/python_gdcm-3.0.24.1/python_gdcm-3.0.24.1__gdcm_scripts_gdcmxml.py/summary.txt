  "conclusion": "The script is a benign wrapper that executes an external gdcm-related binary with user-supplied arguments. Its main security concern is the potential for command injection if inputs are malicious and not validated. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.3-0.4) are consistent with this analysis. To mitigate risks, input validation should be implemented. Overall, the code is not malicious but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments."
