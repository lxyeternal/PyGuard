  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign wrapper around an internal '_gdcm' executable. There are no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for command injection if untrusted inputs are passed via command-line arguments, which is a common risk in such scripts. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate. To enhance security, input sanitization could be implemented, but the code itself is not malicious."
