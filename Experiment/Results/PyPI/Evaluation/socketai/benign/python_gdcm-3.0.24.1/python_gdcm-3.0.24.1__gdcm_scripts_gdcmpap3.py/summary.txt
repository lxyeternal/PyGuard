  "conclusion": "The script is a benign wrapper around a gdcm executable, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The main security concern is the lack of input validation, which could be exploited in a malicious context. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.3 to reflect the potential for command injection if misused."
