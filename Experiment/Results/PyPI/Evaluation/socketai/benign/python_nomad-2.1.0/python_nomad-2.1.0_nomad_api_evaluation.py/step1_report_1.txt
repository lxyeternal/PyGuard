{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for interacting with Nomad's evaluation API endpoints, allowing querying evaluations and associated allocations.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'id_' parameter passed to get_evaluation() and get_allocations(), which are used to fetch specific evaluation data.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from request().json() is processed internally; no direct sinks handling untrusted data are evident. No sinks are directly vulnerable to injection or leakage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (id_) flow into request() calls, which retrieve data that is parsed as JSON and returned. No untrusted data is processed without validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard library functions and exception handling is typical.",
  "analysis": "The class provides methods to query evaluations and their allocations via HTTP requests. The use of parameterized request methods and exception handling reduces the risk of injection. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or data exfiltration. No external network or system commands are executed. No hardcoded secrets are present. The code primarily wraps API endpoints without processing untrusted input in dangerous ways.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation for Nomad evaluations, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as a data retrieval interface, with appropriate exception handling and no signs of malware.",
