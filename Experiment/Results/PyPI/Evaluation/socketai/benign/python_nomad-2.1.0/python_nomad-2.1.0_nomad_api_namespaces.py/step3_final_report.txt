  "purpose": "API client class for interacting with Nomad namespaces, fetching and iterating over namespace data.",
  "sources": "API request to 'namespaces' endpoint, with optional 'prefix' query parameter.",
  "sinks": "None; data is retrieved and processed internally without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "get_namespaces() fetches data from API; other methods use this data to provide container-like behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of user-controlled 'prefix' parameter in request, but standard for API filtering; no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper for Nomad namespaces, with proper exception handling and no obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The only minor concern is the 'prefix' parameter, which could be exploited if request() mishandles input, but this is speculative and depends on the implementation of the inherited request() method. Scores reflect the absence of malicious activity and obfuscation, with a slight security risk due to external input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate API client with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score accounts for potential issues with input handling, but overall, the code is secure and appropriate for use.",
