  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'python-nomad' package, providing metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static strings defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup configuration with no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard for a Python package setup script. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration details. It reads a README file for the long description, which is standard. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code behaviors. The dependencies are straightforward and related to the package's purpose. The code does not contain any malicious patterns or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for package distribution without any anomalies or malicious intent.",
