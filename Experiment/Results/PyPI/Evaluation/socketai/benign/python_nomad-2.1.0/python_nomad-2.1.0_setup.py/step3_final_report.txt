  "flows": "Reading static file -> passing static data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It reads a static README file and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters. No network activity, code injection, or external data handling is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence scores of 1. The code follows standard packaging practices and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
