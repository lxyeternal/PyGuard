{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'python-nomad' package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external sources or used in an insecure manner",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into 'long_description' variable, which is then used in the setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', reads a Markdown file for long description, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and keywords. No untrusted input handling, no network or system modifications, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It properly reads a description file and configures package metadata securely. No vulnerabilities or malicious actions are detected.",
