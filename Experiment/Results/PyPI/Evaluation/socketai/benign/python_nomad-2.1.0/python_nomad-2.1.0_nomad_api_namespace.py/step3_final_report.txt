  "purpose": "A Python class providing CRUD operations for Nomad namespace management via API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Network requests made through inherited request method, handling namespace data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests transmitting JSON payloads to Nomad API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Source (method calls) to network request execution, receiving JSON responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper class for Nomad namespaces, utilizing inherited request methods for network communication. It includes standard exception handling and does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The logic is clear, with no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.1) are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing Nomad namespaces. It shows no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correct.",
