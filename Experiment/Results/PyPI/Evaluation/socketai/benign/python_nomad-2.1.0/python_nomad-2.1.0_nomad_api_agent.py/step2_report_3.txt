  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper for Nomad agent endpoints, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — a low but non-zero risk, likely due to untrusted input being sent via API requests.\n- **Comment:** The report's reasoning is sound; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The high confidence (0.9) seems justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a simple client library with untrusted data flow via API parameters.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with potential risks from unvalidated user input but no direct evidence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is solid; the code's simplicity reduces concern. The confidence (0.9) is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a straightforward API client with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Comment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious logic or obfuscation detected. Confidence remains high (0.9).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms that the code is a typical API wrapper with no malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues identified. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a standard client for Nomad API, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Comment:** Slightly more confident with a security risk of zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no malicious logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is a standard API wrapper, so **malware should remain at 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports report 0, and the code is clear and straightforward. No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The reported risk scores are 0.2 or 0, which are reasonable given that untrusted input could, in theory, be misused if the API server or higher-level code is compromised, but the code itself is not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code appears benign, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Overall Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.2** (due to potential misuse of untrusted input, but no inherent vulnerability)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is a standard, transparent API client with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
