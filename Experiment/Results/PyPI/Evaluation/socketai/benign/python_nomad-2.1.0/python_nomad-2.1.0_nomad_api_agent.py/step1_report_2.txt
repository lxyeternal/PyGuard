{
  "purpose": "A client library for interacting with HashiCorp Nomad agent HTTP API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters (e.g., addresses, node) used in HTTP requests.",
  "sinsks": "Untrusted data provided to HTTP request parameters, notably in join_agent, update_servers, and force_leave methods.",
  "flows": "User-provided addresses or node identifiers are sent via HTTP POST or GET requests to the Nomad API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on external Nomad API endpoints; no malicious code embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for interacting with Nomad agent endpoints, with methods to query agent status, members, servers, and perform actions like joining, updating server list, and forcing a node to leave. All methods pass user inputs directly as parameters in API requests. No data is processed or stored insecurely; no code injection or malicious behavior detected. The class acts as a straightforward API client wrapper without suspicious internal logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple API wrapper for Nomad agent endpoints. It handles user input by passing it to external API calls without processing or storing sensitive data internally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Security risks are limited to proper validation of user input at higher levels, but within this code, nothing appears malicious or dangerous.",
