  "purpose": "A Python class wrapping Nomad agent API endpoints to facilitate querying and managing Nomad agents.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as 'addresses' and 'node' parameters passed into request methods for API calls.",
  "sinks": "API request parameters that could potentially be exploited if untrusted data is maliciously crafted, but typical for an API client.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into request parameters; responses are returned as JSON or status codes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper with methods for querying agent state, members, servers, and controlling agent behavior. It relies on an inherited 'request' method, passing user-supplied data directly into HTTP requests without internal validation or processing. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code's purpose is legitimate, and its structure is typical for such API clients. The use of untrusted input in request parameters is standard but should be validated at higher levels; within this code, it does not pose an inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client for Nomad's agent endpoints with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation, and minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate. It can be considered safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
