  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code only contains import statements; no executable logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are both 0, which aligns with the analysis. Confidence is 1, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly concludes no malicious activity. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, only imports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the reasoning.\n- **Justification:** The analysis is appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, only import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, matching the analysis.\n- **Justification:** Correctly identified as benign; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; no executable code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent.\n- **Justification:** Accurate assessment; no change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Only import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are both 0.1, which is slightly higher than the others but still very low.\n- **Analysis:** Given that the code is only imports, a malware score of 0.1 seems unwarranted unless there's an explicit concern about the package itself. The report states \"securityRisk\": 0.1, which is marginally higher than zero, but the reasoning does not support any malicious activity.\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score should be 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk score should also be 0, since no vulnerabilities or suspicious activity are demonstrated.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks evident)\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is purely import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only inconsistency is in report 5, where the malware and security risk scores are slightly above zero without justification.\n\n**Therefore, my final recommended scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature as a benign, standard import block.",
