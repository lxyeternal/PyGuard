  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines custom exceptions for Nomad API error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of data leakage or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard exception handling for API errors. No malicious activity or obfuscation. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** The code remains standard, with exception classes capturing response data for debugging. The only minor concern is that response text could potentially leak sensitive info if responses contain secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The slight securityRisk score reflects awareness that response text could expose sensitive data, but this is a common trade-off in error reporting, not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, standard exception classes. No malicious behavior. No obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard exception classes. The only note is that including response text in error messages could potentially expose sensitive info, but this is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher securityRisk score accounts for potential data leakage via error messages.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are mostly 0, with some reports assigning minor risk (0.1 or 0.2) due to potential exposure of sensitive data via exception messages. This is a reasonable assessment, not indicating a real security flaw but acknowledging a common security consideration.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code appears safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The minor security risks are related to error message exposure, which is typical and manageable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acknowledging potential info leakage in error messages, but not a critical security flaw)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module with no security risks or malicious behavior. The minor security considerations are typical and do not elevate the risk score significantly.",
