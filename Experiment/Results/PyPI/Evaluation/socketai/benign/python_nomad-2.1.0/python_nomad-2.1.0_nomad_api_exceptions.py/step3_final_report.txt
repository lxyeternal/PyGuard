  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling Nomad API errors, providing detailed error messages including response data for debugging.",
  "sources": "Requests library response objects and input parameters used during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings that include response text or error details, potentially exposing sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with response/error data; __str__ method outputs response text if available.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected; standard exception pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception and requests.exceptions. The __str__ method outputs response text if present, aiding debugging but potentially exposing sensitive data. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The exception classes are typical for API error handling, with no signs of sabotage or security flaws. The inclusion of response text is common but should be handled carefully in production environments to prevent data leaks. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception handling module for API errors, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concern regarding response text exposure is typical and manageable. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to potential data leakage in error messages, not malicious activity.",
