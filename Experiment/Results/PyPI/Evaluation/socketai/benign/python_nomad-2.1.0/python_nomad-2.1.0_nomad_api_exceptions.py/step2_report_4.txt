  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided evaluations.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to interactions with the Nomad API.\n- It imports the requests library and uses response objects and exceptions from it.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from standard Python exceptions or requests exceptions.\n- The __str__ method in BaseNomadException outputs response text if available, aiding debugging.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical, well-structured error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports agree on this point.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws:** None are evident. The only minor consideration is that exposing response text in exceptions could leak sensitive data, but this is standard practice in error reporting, not a flaw per se.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Most reports assign 0 or very low (0.1 or 0.2). \n- The only potential concern is that including response text in exception messages might expose sensitive data if responses contain secrets.\n- However, this is a common debugging practice, not malicious, and does not constitute a security risk by itself.\n- Therefore, a security risk score of **0.2** seems reasonable, but it should be noted that this is more about cautious handling than an actual vulnerability.\n\n#### Overall Risk Score:\n- Given the above, the overall risk score should remain very low, around **0.1 to 0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n- **All reports** correctly identify that the code is standard exception handling, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The reports mention the potential for response text to leak sensitive data, which is a valid point but not a security flaw in the code itself.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 (to reflect cautiousness about exposing response text, but not a real risk)\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a standard, safe exception handling module with no malicious intent. The only consideration is to handle response texts carefully to avoid leaking sensitive data, but this is a common and accepted practice in error reporting.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues. The minor security concern about exposing response text should be noted but does not warrant a higher risk score.",
