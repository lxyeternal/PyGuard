{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Nomad API interactions",
  "sources": "Importing requests library; raising exceptions based on request responses and errors",
  "sinks": "Exception message generation, particularly accessing response text for error reporting",
  "flows": "Requests response or exception data flow into exception constructors, with messages constructed from response content",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes that extend standard Python exceptions and requests exceptions. These classes store response data or error messages and generate informative string representations. The classes are primarily used for error handling during HTTP requests to a Nomad API. The code does not perform any network operations itself, nor does it contain code injection, data leakage, or other malicious behaviors. The exception handling pattern is standard and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
