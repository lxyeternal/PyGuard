  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Defines custom exceptions for Nomad API error handling.  \n- Sources: Uses requests library response objects and input parameters.  \n- Sinks: Error messages with response text or error details.  \n- Flows: Instantiation of exceptions with response/error data, string conversion for messages.  \n- Anomalies: No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed.  \n- Analysis: Standard pattern of custom exceptions, with detailed string representations. No data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward, typical exception module.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception classes for API errors.  \n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n- Uses standard Python and requests patterns.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, typical error handling.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on error handling, response data, and string representations.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still very high.  \n- Noted that response text could expose sensitive info, but this is common in error reporting, not malicious.  \n- Security risk score: 0.1 (very low).  \n- Conclusion: Standard, safe implementation.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar to previous, standard custom exceptions.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Clear and straightforward.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar pattern, with a note that response text may contain sensitive data.  \n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to potential exposure of response content, but not malicious.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is just a set of custom exception classes, with no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate zero malware. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network operations, or data exfiltration.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and clear.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (error handling classes), the risk is minimal. The only potential concern is that error messages include response text, which could expose sensitive data if responses contain secrets. However, this is a common practice in error reporting, not malicious. The risk score of 0.2 in some reports seems reasonable.  \n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to potential exposure of sensitive info in error messages, but not malicious)  \n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module with no security risks or malicious intent.**",
