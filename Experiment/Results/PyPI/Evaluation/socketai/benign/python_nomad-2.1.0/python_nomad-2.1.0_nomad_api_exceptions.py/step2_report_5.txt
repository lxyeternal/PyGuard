  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code defines custom exceptions for handling Nomad API errors. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The response text is included in error messages, which is standard practice.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both are correctly scored as 0, given the benign nature.  \n- **Score justification:** The confidence is high (1), and no issues are identified.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms straightforward exception classes for API error handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both are 0, which aligns with the code’s nature.  \n- **Score justification:** The high confidence (1) is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, with a note that response text is used in exception messages, which could potentially leak sensitive info if responses contain secrets.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both correctly scored as 0.  \n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher at 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential for sensitive data exposure but not malicious intent.  \n- **Score justification:** The reasoning is sound; the potential for data leakage is acknowledged but not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments; no suspicious code.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Score justification:** The confidence is high (1), and no issues are detected.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, with an emphasis that including response text could expose sensitive data.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both 0, aligning with the code’s nature.  \n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher at 0.2, due to potential data exposure, but no malicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Reasonable, given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior (score 0). The code is purely exception class definitions, with no code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are correct in assigning 0, as the code is straightforward and clear.  \n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are mostly 0 or 0.1–0.2, which is appropriate considering the potential for sensitive data exposure via exception messages, but no actual security breach or malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The response text inclusion in exceptions should be handled carefully in production to avoid leaking secrets, but this is a common practice in error reporting, not malicious.  \n- The scores are consistent with the code’s nature.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk related to potential data leakage, but not a security threat.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured exception module for API error handling with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security concern is the potential exposure of sensitive data in error messages, which is a common trade-off in error reporting but should be managed carefully in deployment.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.1**",
