{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to interactions with the Nomad API, including request errors and response-based errors.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'nomad_resp' parameter passed during exception instantiation, primarily responses from the 'requests' library.",
  "sinks": "Exception message generation and logging; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Error response data from 'nomad_resp' flows into exception string representations for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exceptions or 'requests' exceptions. The '__str__' method in 'BaseNomadException' extracts and displays response text if available, which is typical for debugging. The exceptions are clearly named for specific error cases such as URL not found, unauthorized access, bad requests, variable conflicts, and request timeouts. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code relies on standard 'requests' library features and exception handling patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment implements standard custom exception classes for API error handling without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for use in API interaction contexts.",
