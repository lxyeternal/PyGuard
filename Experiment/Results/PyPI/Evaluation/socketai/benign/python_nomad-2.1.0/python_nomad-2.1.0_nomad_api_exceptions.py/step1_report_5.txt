  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors related to interactions with the Nomad API.",
  "sources": "Requests responses, exception handling during API interaction.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages that could potentially expose response text or errors if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Request responses or error objects are passed to exception constructors, which generate messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets observed. Exception classes follow standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for API error handling. It uses standard Python exception inheritance. The only potential concern is that in the __str__ method of BaseNomadException, the response text may be included in error messages, which could expose sensitive information if the response contains secrets or confidential data. However, this is typical in error reporting and does not constitute malicious behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be straightforward error handling for API interactions, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The inclusion of response text in exceptions should be handled carefully to avoid exposing sensitive data, but it is not inherently malicious.",
