{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to interactions with the Nomad API",
  "sources": "Imports the 'requests' library, particularly for referencing 'requests.Response' and 'requests.exceptions.RequestException'",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions or external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception classes that are standard and explicitly related to request handling; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class and requests' exceptions. The BaseNomadException encapsulates an HTTP response object, primarily to provide detailed error messages. Subclasses specify particular error types like URL not found, unauthorized access, bad requests, and variable conflicts. The TimeoutNomadException inherits from requests.exceptions.RequestException, indicating it's used for request timeout scenarios. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be standard error handling related to API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It functions as part of a larger library for error management, with no evidence of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
