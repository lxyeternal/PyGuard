  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the scoring, and the security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines custom exceptions inheriting from standard Python exceptions and requests exceptions.\n- The `__str__` method in `BaseNomadException` includes response text if available, which is standard for debugging but could expose sensitive info.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and aligns with typical error handling patterns for API interactions.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Define custom exceptions for Nomad API errors.  \n- Sources: Requests library and parameters.  \n- Anomalies: None detected.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0  \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources: Requests library.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Conclusion: Standard exception classes, no malicious intent.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0  \n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Similar exception definitions, with focus on response handling.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.  \n- Analysis notes the inclusion of response text in error messages, which is typical but should be handled carefully to avoid data leaks.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low) — this is reasonable given the potential for exposing sensitive data if response text contains secrets, but this is a common practice in debugging/error reporting, not malicious.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The score is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Similar, focusing on request errors.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- The analysis correctly notes the standard pattern and the potential exposure of sensitive info via response text.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (still low).  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar exception classes.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- The report highlights the potential security concern of exposing response text, which is a valid point but not malicious.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable).  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The risk score reflects the potential for sensitive data exposure, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured exception handling module for API errors.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The inclusion of response text in error messages is standard but should be used cautiously in production to avoid data leaks.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, considering the potential for sensitive data exposure in error messages.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes needed; the analysis aligns with the code's actual behavior.\n- For security best practices, consider sanitizing or redacting sensitive information from error responses before logging or exposing them.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Metric          | Score / Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.                                                             |\n| Obfuscated     | 0 — Clear, straightforward exception classes.                                                             |\n| Risk           | 0.1–0.2 — Slight potential for sensitive data exposure via error messages; acceptable in context.        |\n\nThe overall security posture of this code is safe, with no indications of supply chain threats or malicious activity.",
