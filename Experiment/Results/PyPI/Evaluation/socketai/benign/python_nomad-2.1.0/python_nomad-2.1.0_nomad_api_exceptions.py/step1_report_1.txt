  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors related to interactions with the Nomad API.",
  "sources": "Requests library for HTTP response objects and input parameters passed to exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potential error messages generated by exception __str__ methods that include response text or error details.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with response or error data, then calling __str__ to generate messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious dynamic execution; all exception handling appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions and requests exceptions. The BaseNomadException captures responses from requests and provides detailed string representations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No data leakage or unsafe practices are observed. The structure follows typical exception pattern. No external or suspicious data flows are detected beyond standard error handling. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception module for API error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward exception handling module for Nomad API interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is a typical implementation of custom exceptions for error reporting.",
