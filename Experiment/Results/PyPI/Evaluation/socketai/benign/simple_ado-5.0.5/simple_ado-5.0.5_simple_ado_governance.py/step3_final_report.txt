  "purpose": "A wrapper around Azure DevOps governance APIs for managing repositories, policies, alerts, and branches.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided to methods (e.g., project_id, governed_repository_id, policy_id), and response data decoded from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs for API requests, HTTP GET/PUT/DELETE calls, response decoding and validation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build API endpoints; responses are decoded and returned or used to update settings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. URL construction is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Azure DevOps governance features. It constructs URLs dynamically based on input parameters, makes HTTP requests, and processes responses. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Error handling is appropriate. The overall design aligns with typical API wrapper patterns, with no suspicious anomalies. The consistent absence of malicious indicators across multiple similar reports supports a low malware score. The code's interaction with external APIs and lack of input validation are typical for such clients but do not constitute security risks or malicious intent. The risk score is low, reflecting the minimal inherent vulnerabilities but acknowledging potential misuse if API credentials are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for Azure DevOps governance functions. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
