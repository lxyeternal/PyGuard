{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for interacting with Azure DevOps (ADO) Graph APIs, providing methods to retrieve information about groups, users, and subject descriptors.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET and POST requests made to the ADO Graph API endpoints, using user-provided identifiers such as storage keys, subject descriptors, and scope descriptors.",
  "sinks": "Decoding API responses, returning data structures, and yielding values from the response payloads.",
  "flows": "Input identifiers (storage keys, subject descriptors, scope descriptors) are used to construct API request URLs. These URLs are used to fetch data via HTTP requests, then responses are decoded and returned or processed further.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of standard API endpoints and versioning. No unusual or obfuscated code; the logic appears straightforward. No indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clean, straightforward wrapper around ADO Graph API endpoints. It constructs request URLs dynamically based on provided parameters, performs GET and POST requests, decodes responses, and yields or returns data. The usage of API version strings and the structure indicates adherence to the official API specifications. There are no signs of malicious payloads, hidden code, or obfuscation. No external data is being sent outside of expected API calls. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected. The code's intent is to facilitate safe API interactions, with no evident malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for Azure DevOps Graph operations with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It performs legitimate API requests with proper response handling. No malicious or sabotage code detected.",
