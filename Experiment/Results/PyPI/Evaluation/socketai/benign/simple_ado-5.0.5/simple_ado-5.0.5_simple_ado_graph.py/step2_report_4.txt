  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code as a wrapper around Azure DevOps Graph API, using HTTP GET/POST requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; data flows from input parameters into URL construction, responses are decoded.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as a straightforward API client with no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 (very low, reasonable).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes standard API interaction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; URL formation, response decoding, pagination handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or code obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; the code is a typical API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 (appropriate).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the class as an API wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; constructs URLs, makes API calls, decodes responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard API client code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 (still low, acceptable).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the code as an API wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; URL construction, response processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; the code appears to be a legitimate, benign API client.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly assesses the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the code as an API wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; constructs URLs, processes responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No hidden or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with prior reports; benign API client.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, reflecting standard API client code.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, consistent with a legitimate API wrapper.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, just the inherent risk of API interaction, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk scores are justified. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
