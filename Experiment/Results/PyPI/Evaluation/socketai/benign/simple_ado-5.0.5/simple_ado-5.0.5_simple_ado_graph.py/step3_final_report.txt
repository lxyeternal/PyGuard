  "purpose": "A wrapper class around Azure DevOps Graph API endpoints, facilitating API calls such as retrieving scope descriptors, storage keys, subjects, groups, and users.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as storage_key, subject_descriptor, scope_descriptor, and descriptors used to construct API URLs; external HTTP client methods for GET and POST requests.",
  "sinks": "API request URLs, response decoding, and data extraction; no direct data leaks or untrusted data effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL construction; responses are decoded and returned; pagination tokens are handled for list endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, standard API wrapper for Azure DevOps Graph API. It constructs URLs with input parameters, performs HTTP requests, decodes responses, and manages pagination. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The code relies on an external HTTP client library, which appears standard. The response handling and URL formation are correct, and no suspicious patterns are present. The security risk is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately set to zero. The overall security assessment is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
