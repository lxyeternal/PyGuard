  "purpose": "A wrapper for Azure DevOps (ADO) Graph APIs to facilitate operations such as retrieving groups, users, and descriptors.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET and POST requests to API endpoints, reading response headers and JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Decoding responses, extracting values, iterating over responses, and returning data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data (like scope descriptors, subject descriptors) is used to build API request URLs. These are sent over HTTP, responses are decoded, and data is returned or yielded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution. No unusual code structures or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API wrapper for Azure DevOps Graph APIs, implementing various methods for retrieving group and user information. It constructs request URLs dynamically based on input parameters, performs HTTP requests, decodes responses, and handles pagination via continuation tokens. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious functions such as system command execution, network exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Usage of the HTTP client appears straightforward. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or malicious code snippets are present. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate API wrapper without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API wrapper for Azure DevOps Graph API with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It properly handles API calls, response decoding, and pagination without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
