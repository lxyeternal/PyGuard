  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper around Azure DevOps Graph API endpoints.\n- It constructs URLs with input parameters, makes HTTP GET/POST requests, decodes responses, and handles pagination.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code relies on an external HTTP client library, which appears standard.\n- The purpose is to facilitate API interactions, not to perform any malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1: Malware Score**\n\n**Reported score:** 0  \n**Analysis:** All reports concur that the code shows no signs of malware or malicious intent. The code only makes API calls, processes responses, and yields data. No payloads, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The malware score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2: Obfuscated Score**\n\n**Reported score:** 0  \n**Analysis:** The code is clear, straightforward, and employs standard patterns. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3: Security Risk / Potential Vulnerabilities**\n\n**Reported score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports.  \n**Analysis:**  \n- The code interacts with external APIs, but this is expected for an API wrapper.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.\n- Input parameters are used to construct URLs but are not directly controlled by untrusted sources within this snippet.\n- The code does not perform any data validation or sanitization, but given it's a wrapper, this is typical.\n\n**Risk justification:**  \n- The low scores (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern based on this code alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4: Logical or Reasoning Flaws in Reports**\n\n**Observation:**  \n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n**No issues identified here.**\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5: Inconsistencies in Scores**\n\n- All reports assign **malware = 0** and **obfuscated = 0**.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high, supporting the conclusion.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- No changes needed; scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification and Summary**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — minimal, consistent with a standard API wrapper.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n| Category          | Score |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Malware           | 0       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1     |\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code appears safe, always consider the security of the underlying HTTP client library and the environment in which this code runs. Proper access controls and validation should be enforced at higher levels, but within this snippet, no issues are evident.",
