  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine if the issues are valid, if the scores are appropriate, and whether any adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward Azure DevOps API wrapper with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors. It primarily constructs API requests based on parameters and performs standard HTTP interactions.\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns well with the code. The logic is sound, and no issues are apparent.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions with proper input handling and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no backdoors, standard URL encoding, and safe data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a legitimate API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard Azure DevOps API wrapper, with inputs flowing into URL construction and request bodies, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Inputs are handled properly, and the code appears secure.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is benign.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 is suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard API interactions with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Proper handling of inputs and responses.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears safe and well-structured.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also consistent with prior assessments—standard API wrapper, no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Findings:** Proper use of API endpoints, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. All findings are consistent with a benign SDK wrapper.\n\n- **Score consistency:** All malware scores are zero, which is correct given the code. Obfuscated scores are zero, matching the straightforward implementation. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk associated with API wrappers that do not handle secrets directly.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** Since the code interacts with external APIs and accepts user input for URL construction, the main risk is improper input validation or misuse. However, the code uses URL encoding and proper request construction, mitigating common issues.\n\n- **Any necessary adjustments?**  \n  - The scores seem appropriate. No evidence suggests higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n  - The security risk could be marginally increased if considering the possibility of misuse, but given the code's nature, the current scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric            | Score   | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation patterns present.                   |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1-0.2 | Minimal risk; primarily API interaction, no secrets handled or exposed.    |\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the minimal inherent risk of API wrapper code)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.",
