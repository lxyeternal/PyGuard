  "purpose": "A wrapper for Azure DevOps (ADO) API to manage projects, pull requests, and other related operations.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as branch names, project IDs, repository IDs, URLs, and request bodies; data fetched from API responses.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to ADO API endpoints, especially in methods like create_pull_request, list_all_pull_requests, and custom_get; data decoding and extraction functions.",
  "flows": "Function parameters and input data flow into request URL construction, which then triggers HTTP requests; responses are decoded and processed, with data possibly flowing back into the application logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. Usage of standard API endpoints and legitimate methods. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow. Proper input handling and encoding observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API wrapper for Azure DevOps, with functions for creating and listing pull requests, verifying access, and custom GET requests. Inputs such as branch names and IDs are properly used for request construction. The functions use standard URL encoding and API endpoint handling. No hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or backdoors are evident. The code follows standard practices for API interaction, with proper exception handling in verify_access. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security bypasses are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client wrapper for Azure DevOps with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be well-structured, following standard practices, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.",
