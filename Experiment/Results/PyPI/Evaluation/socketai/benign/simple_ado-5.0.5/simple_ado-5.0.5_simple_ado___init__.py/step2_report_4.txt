  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a Python SDK wrapper for Azure DevOps API.\n- It provides methods for verifying access, creating pull requests, listing PRs, and performing custom GET requests.\n- It uses standard libraries (`requests`, `urllib.parse`) and typical API interaction patterns.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- Inputs are sanitized and URL-encoded before use.\n- No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no malware, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, standard practices.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent, no concerns.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Similar API wrapper.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, proper handling of inputs, no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same functionality.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard API usage, no secrets.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and benign.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, proper input handling.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code matches the description and is a standard API wrapper. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The code uses standard URL encoding, proper exception handling in `verify_access`, and parameter sanitization.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Security risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical API client risk, which is minimal here.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** The only slight concern could be if user inputs are maliciously crafted to exploit the API or cause unexpected behavior. However, the code properly encodes parameters and uses standard API endpoints, minimizing such risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**I agree with the reported scores and conclusions.** The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security concerns based on the provided analysis.",
