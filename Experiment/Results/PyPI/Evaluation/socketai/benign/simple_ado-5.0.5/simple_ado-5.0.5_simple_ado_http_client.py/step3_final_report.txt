  "purpose": "A Python HTTP client wrapper for Azure DevOps APIs, providing methods for GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, and file uploads with retry and rate limiting features.",
  "sources": "Request URL parameters, headers (including authorization), file paths during uploads, and response content.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Azure DevOps endpoints, response handling, and file reading during uploads.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (e.g., request URLs, headers, files) lead to network requests; responses are validated and parsed; no untrusted data is executed or leaked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with retry logic, rate limiting, and response validation. It reads files only during uploads, handles headers securely, and does not execute untrusted code. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its benign, well-structured nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and transparent API wrapper for Azure DevOps. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its benign behavior.",
