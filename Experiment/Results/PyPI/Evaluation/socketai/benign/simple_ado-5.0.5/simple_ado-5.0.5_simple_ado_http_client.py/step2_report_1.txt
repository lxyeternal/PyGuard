  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code is a standard HTTP client wrapper with no suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.  \n  **Confirmed:** No malicious issues detected.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward. No logical flaws are apparent.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — low, considering it's an API client.  \n  - Confidence: 1.0 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code is a typical API wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity. Files are read only in `post_file`, which is standard.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is accurate; no suspicious patterns or code injection.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — still low, given standard API client behavior.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The assessment is appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code reads files for upload but does not process or execute untrusted code. No malicious logic.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly states the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — fitting for a network client.  \n  - Confidence: 0.95 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The evaluation is accurate; no modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code handles network requests, retries, and rate limiting, all standard. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — acceptable, given its function.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The report's assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code handles API requests securely, with no signs of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The analysis is accurate.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — suitable.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — suitable.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — fitting.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The report's conclusion is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are reasonable given the code's nature as a network API client.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, as it is a standard API wrapper with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. No modifications are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
