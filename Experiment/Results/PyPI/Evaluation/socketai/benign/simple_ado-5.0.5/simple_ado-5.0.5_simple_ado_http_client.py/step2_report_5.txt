  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward HTTP client wrapper for Azure DevOps APIs, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses retries, rate limiting, and response validation appropriately.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, or malicious patterns. External dependencies are standard, and the logic is transparent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, considering it's a standard API client.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high certainty.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code appears benign and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity. The code reads files for upload but in a normal, expected manner.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscated code, no backdoors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, given the nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a typical API wrapper, handling authentication, retries, and uploads securely.\n- **Findings:** File uploads are straightforward; no signs of malicious activity or secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with rate limiting, retries, and response validation.\n- **Findings:** No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns. Uses external 'ADOAuth' for credentials, which is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—legitimate API wrapper, no malicious behavior, handling data securely.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code is a standard HTTP API client with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1–0.2), appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- It employs standard libraries and patterns for network communication, retries, and rate limiting.\n- File uploads are handled securely and transparently.\n- No suspicious data flows, command executions, or obfuscation patterns are present.\n- External dependencies like 'requests' and 'tenacity' are used appropriately.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, typical for a network client library.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Azure DevOps, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The provided scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
