  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code is a standard API client.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; reasoning sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No suspicious activity; standard API wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent; code handles network operations securely.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate API client, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified; no red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No suspicious behavior; standard file upload handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** File reading and request sending are typical; no malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure code.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; scores consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity; standard API wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, benign code.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity; standard request handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No dynamic code execution, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate API wrapper.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal security risk due to network operations and external dependencies, but nothing alarming.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minor risk due to network interactions, retries, and external dependencies, but overall low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The entire set of reports aligns with the code's benign nature. No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The security posture appears sound, with scores appropriately reflecting the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores, but if a more conservative stance is desired, slightly increasing the risk score to 0.2 could be justified, though it's not necessary given the evidence.",
