  "purpose": "A wrapper class for making authenticated HTTP API calls to Azure DevOps services, including methods for GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, and file upload operations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as request_url, additional_headers, json_data, operations, and file_path. Environment variables are not directly read, but external configuration may influence auth.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (requests.Session methods) that send data to external endpoints. No direct data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (request URLs, headers, payloads, files) flow into HTTP request methods; responses are validated, decoded, or processed. No suspicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of retry decorators with exponential backoff appears standard. No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard HTTP client wrapper for Azure DevOps APIs, with methods to handle various HTTP verbs, rate limiting, retries, and response processing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious network activity. All inputs are used as parameters, and external dependencies are typical for such a client. No anomalous or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client for Azure DevOps, with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs expected operations securely and transparently.",
