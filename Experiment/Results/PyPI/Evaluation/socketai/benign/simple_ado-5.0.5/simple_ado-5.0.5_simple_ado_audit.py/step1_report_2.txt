  "purpose": "Wrapper for Azure DevOps (ADO) Audit APIs to retrieve audit actions and logs.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests via self.http_client.get; URL construction with parameters; response decoding.",
  "sinks": "Decoding response data; returning deserialized data; URL encoding parameters for API requests.",
  "flows": "Parameters such as start_time, end_time, and area_name are used to build request URLs; responses are decoded and returned or iterated over.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard API request patterns observed. No malicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API wrapper class for interacting with Azure DevOps audit logs. It constructs URLs with query parameters based on user input and fetches data via HTTP GET requests. Response data is decoded and returned as deserialized objects or iterators. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of urllib.parse for URL encoding and response decoding appears standard. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical API wrapper for Azure DevOps audit logs. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
