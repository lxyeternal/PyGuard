  "purpose": "A wrapper around Azure DevOps (ADO) audit APIs to fetch audit actions and log entries.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as 'area_name', 'start_time', 'end_time', 'skip_aggregation', and constructs URLs and API requests; reads response data from HTTP client.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to the ADO audit endpoint, URL encoding parameters, response decoding, and yielding audit log entries.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> HTTP GET request -> Response decoding -> Data extraction -> Yield audit log entries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of external dependencies appears standard; no obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution detected. URL construction and API calls follow expected patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward API wrapper for querying audit logs from Azure DevOps. It carefully constructs URL parameters, handles pagination via continuation tokens, and decodes responses for further processing. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network behavior is present. The use of standard libraries and API calls aligns with expected secure practices. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for Azure DevOps audit logs with no malicious behavior detected. It follows standard practices for API interaction, parameter handling, and response processing. No security risks or malware signals are evident.",
