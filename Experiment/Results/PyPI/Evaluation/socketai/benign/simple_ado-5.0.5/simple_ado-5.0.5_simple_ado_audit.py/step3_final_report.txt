  "purpose": "Wrapper class around Azure DevOps (ADO) Audit APIs for retrieving audit actions and logs, constructing URLs with parameters, handling pagination, and decoding responses.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as 'area_name', 'start_time', 'end_time', and 'skip_aggregation' used to build request URLs; HTTP GET requests to the audit endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Response decoding and yielding audit log entries; no untrusted data flows into system effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Parameters are incorporated into URLs via urllib.parse.urlencode(), then requests are made; responses are decoded and processed, with pagination handled via continuation tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Slightly unconventional URL construction with trailing '?' but not harmful.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API wrapper for Azure DevOps audit logs. It uses standard libraries and practices, with proper URL encoding to mitigate injection risks. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic for handling pagination and response decoding is correct. Minor considerations include lack of explicit input validation, but this does not constitute a security flaw. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious API wrapper with no signs of sabotage, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk reflects standard API interaction without sensitive data handling or risky operations.",
