{
  "purpose": "The code is a wrapper around the Azure DevOps (ADO) audit API, enabling retrieval of audit actions and logs.",
  "sources": "Reads data from method parameters (area_name, start_time, end_time, skip_aggregation), environment variables (via imported modules, though not explicitly shown), and external HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Uses the HTTP client to send GET requests and decode responses; does not write or store data directly.",
  "flows": "Constructs URLs with query parameters from input, sends requests to ADO endpoints, decodes responses, and yields log entries. Data flows from external inputs through URL construction to network requests and response processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious URL manipulations or unusual data handling observed. The URL construction appears standard for API interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly constructs API request URLs with parameters, utilizes a safe HTTP client for network communication, and processes responses. It includes pagination via continuation tokens, typical for API data retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The modules imported are standard, and no dynamic code execution is present. The logic aligns with standard API wrapper patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate API wrapper for ADO audit logs. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It handles data retrieval securely and transparently without hidden or malicious operations.",
