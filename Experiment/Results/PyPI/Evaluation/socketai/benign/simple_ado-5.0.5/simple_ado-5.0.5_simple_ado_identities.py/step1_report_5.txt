  "purpose": "A wrapper class for interacting with Azure DevOps (ADO) identities API to fetch identity information and GUIDs.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to the graph_endpoint with search filters based on user input (identity parameter).",
  "sinks": "HTTP request formation and execution, decoding the response, and extracting values from the response data.",
  "flows": "User provides 'identity' input -> URL constructed with this input -> HTTP request sent -> response decoded -> data extracted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual data handling. No suspicious or obfuscated code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard API wrapper for querying identity information. It constructs request URLs with user input, calls external HTTP methods, decodes responses, and handles multiple or missing results with exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It relies on external libraries for HTTP communication and data handling, which are standard and not suspicious. The functions are straightforward, with input validation via exception handling for multiple/missing identities, and do not include any covert or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API wrapper for ADO identities, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It follows standard patterns and does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
