{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for Azure DevOps pipeline API interactions, providing methods to retrieve, preview, and run pipelines.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include API responses from the HTTP client (e.g., get, post requests), URL parameters, and method arguments for project ID, pipeline ID, etc.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP requests (get/post) to Azure DevOps API endpoints, and responses are decoded for further use. No direct data sinks for untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters flows into URL construction and request bodies. Responses are decoded and returned or yielded. No suspicious flow paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. URL construction appears standard; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious variable manipulations observed. The code follows typical API wrapper patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API wrapper for Azure DevOps pipelines, utilizing safe HTTP request methods. It constructs URLs securely, encodes parameters properly, and decodes responses. No indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code does not handle or store sensitive data insecurely, nor does it perform any risky operations such as executing untrusted code or accessing system resources beyond API calls. Overall, the code appears well-structured, with clear intent and no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured API client wrapper with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It safely interacts with Azure DevOps API endpoints and does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations.",
