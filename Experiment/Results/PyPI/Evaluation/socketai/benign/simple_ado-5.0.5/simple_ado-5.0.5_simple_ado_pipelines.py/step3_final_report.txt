{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for Azure DevOps pipeline APIs, providing methods to retrieve, preview, and run pipelines.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as project_id, pipeline_id, run_id, and optional method arguments; URL construction for API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "API requests to Azure DevOps endpoints; response decoding and data return.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct URLs and request bodies; responses are decoded and returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "In `get_pipeline` and `preview`, URL concatenation for `pipelineVersion` lacks proper query parameter syntax, potentially leading to malformed URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API wrapper with correct URL construction, request handling, and response decoding. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The only technical issue is the improper URL parameter concatenation for optional `pipelineVersion`, which could cause runtime errors but is not malicious. The code does not perform any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting typical API interaction risks. Malware score is zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Azure DevOps pipeline API wrapper with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minor URL concatenation bug should be fixed for correctness but does not pose security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
