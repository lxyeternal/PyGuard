{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a wrapper around Azure DevOps (ADO) Pipeline APIs, facilitating interactions such as retrieving pipeline information, previewing pipelines, and running pipelines programmatically.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters for project_id, pipeline_id, run_id, pipeline_version, resources, stages_to_skip, template_parameters, variables; API responses from HTTP client.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP client making GET and POST requests, handling responses, and constructing URLs with query parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are used to construct URLs and request bodies; these are sent via the HTTP client's get/post methods (sinks); responses are decoded and returned to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data detected. The code constructs URLs and request bodies dynamically based on input parameters; no obfuscated or unusual code structures. No suspicious URL manipulations or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured API wrapper with methods for managing Azure DevOps pipelines. It carefully constructs URLs and request bodies based on input parameters, adhering to the Azure DevOps REST API specifications. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The code uses standard libraries and a presumed legitimate HTTP client to perform API calls. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The flow from input parameters to API request and response handling appears straightforward and consistent with intended API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API wrapper for Azure DevOps pipeline management without any indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. It follows standard practices for constructing requests and handling responses. Overall, it appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
