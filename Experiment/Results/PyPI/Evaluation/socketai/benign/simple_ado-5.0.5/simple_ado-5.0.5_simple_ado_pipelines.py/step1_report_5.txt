{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper around Azure DevOps pipeline APIs to manage, retrieve, preview, and run pipelines programmatically.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and input data from method parameters and the HTTP responses from the external ADO API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include constructing URLs with parameters and sending POST requests with JSON data, but no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to critical vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method input parameters to URL construction and request bodies, then from HTTP responses to decoded data, with no evident untrusted data flow to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; there are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The pipeline ID and project ID are input parameters, not hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API wrapper with methods that construct URLs, make HTTP GET and POST requests, and decode responses. It uses parameters and external API responses without executing untrusted code or handling user input directly. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are present. The absence of dynamic code execution, suspicious URL manipulations, or hidden backdoors suggests this is benign code. It only interacts with Azure DevOps REST APIs as intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It responsibly handles external API interactions without suspicious or malicious patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Overall, the code appears safe and serves its purpose as an Azure DevOps pipeline management utility.",
