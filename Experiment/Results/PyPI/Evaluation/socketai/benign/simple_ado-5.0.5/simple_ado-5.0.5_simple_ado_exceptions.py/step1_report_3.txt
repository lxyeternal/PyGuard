{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling Azure DevOps (ADO) related errors, specifically HTTP exceptions, to be used in an application interacting with ADO APIs.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for exception messages and the response object passed during instantiation of ADOHTTPException.",
  "sinks": "The string representation of the exception includes response status code and text, which could potentially leak sensitive response data if the exception is logged or displayed improperly.",
  "flows": "The response object flows from the constructor to the __str__ method, where its status_code and text are accessed for output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard exception handling and requests library objects appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions for ADO errors. It accepts and stores a response object from the requests library, then outputs its status code and text in the string representation. There are no signs of malicious logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The inclusion of response details in error messages should be handled carefully in production to avoid leaking sensitive data, but this is a standard practice in debugging or error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical exception handling module for HTTP errors related to Azure DevOps API interactions. There is no malicious behavior or security risks present beyond standard considerations for logging response data. Overall, it’s a benign component with no malware or security threats detected.",
