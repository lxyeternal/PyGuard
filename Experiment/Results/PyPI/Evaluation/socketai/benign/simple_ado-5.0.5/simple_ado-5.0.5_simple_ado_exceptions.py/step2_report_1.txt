  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a simple exception class hierarchy, designed to handle errors related to Azure DevOps interactions.\n- It imports the `requests` library and defines two classes: `ADOException` and `ADOHTTPException`.\n- The `ADOHTTPException` stores a message and a response object, and its `__str__` method outputs response status code and text.\n- No data is read from external sources directly; the code does not perform network requests itself.\n- The response object could contain untrusted data, but the code itself does not process or modify it beyond storing and outputting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues and code presence:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code defines exception classes with standard patterns.\n- The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated logic.\n- The `requests` library is imported, but no network activity occurs within this snippet.\n- The `__str__` method accesses `response.status_code` and `response.text`, which could potentially leak sensitive data if printed or logged carelessly, but this is a common pattern in error handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior or security flaws inherently present.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Accuracy of reasoning:** All reports correctly identify that the code is standard exception handling. They note the potential security concern of exposing response data via `__str__`, which is valid but not necessarily a flaw in the code itself.\n- **Potential overstatement:** The reports imply that the code is entirely benign, which is accurate, but they also mention that response data could leak sensitive info if logged improperly. This is a standard consideration but not a flaw in the code per se.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the absence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**No significant logical errors or flaws are detected in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; there's no malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`. Correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly `0` or `0.2`. Given the potential for response data leakage if logs are not sanitized, a small risk score (0.2) is justified, but not higher.\n\n**Recommendation:** The security risk scores are reasonable; they reflect a minimal concern about data leakage if response data is logged without sanitization.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is appropriate.\n- The highest is 0.2, reflecting a minor concern about data leakage, not a significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and potential adjustments:\n\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The scores seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (due to potential data leakage if response text is logged)  \n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is a standard pattern for exception handling.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only consideration is the exposure of response data in logs or error messages, which is a common concern but not a flaw in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for handling Azure DevOps HTTP errors. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to logging or displaying response content, which should be handled carefully in production environments.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
