  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for Azure DevOps (ADO) error handling, specifically for HTTP-related errors.",
  "sources": "The response object passed into ADOHTTPException, specifically response.status_code and response.text.",
  "sinks": "The string representation (__str__) of the exception, which outputs response status code and text.",
  "flows": "Response object is stored during exception instantiation and later accessed in __str__, potentially exposing response content if logged or displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard exception class structure. The only notable aspect is exposing response.text in __str__, which could leak sensitive info if not handled properly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, with ADOHTTPException storing a message and a requests.Response object. The __str__ method outputs response status code and text, which could contain untrusted or sensitive data. No external data is read or processed within this snippet. The pattern is typical for error handling; no obfuscation or malicious code is present. The potential security concern is response data leakage if exception strings are logged or displayed without sanitization. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign but note the data exposure risk. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, acknowledging the minor concern about response data exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for handling HTTP errors in Azure DevOps interactions. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the exposure of response content via exception string output, which should be managed carefully in production environments to prevent sensitive data leaks.",
