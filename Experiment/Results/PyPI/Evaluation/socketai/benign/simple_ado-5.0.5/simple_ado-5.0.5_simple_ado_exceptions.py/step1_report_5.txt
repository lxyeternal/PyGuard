{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling Azure DevOps (ADO) related errors, specifically HTTP exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'requests' library, which is used for HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines exception classes and their string representation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard pattern for custom exceptions with no suspicious or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' library, which is used for HTTP communication, but does not perform any requests itself. It defines two custom exception classes, ADOException and ADOHTTPException, the latter including a message and a response object. The __str__ method outputs details from the response object, but does not handle or process untrusted data insecurely. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for ADO HTTP errors, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves a standard purpose within a larger application.",
