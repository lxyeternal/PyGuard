{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Azure DevOps (ADO) related errors, specifically HTTP exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for exception messages and the response object passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method accesses response.status_code and response.text, which could potentially contain untrusted data if response is compromised.",
  "flows": "When an ADOHTTPException is raised, it stores a message and an HTTP response; calling __str__ accesses response attributes, which could be untrusted if response data is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes with clear inheritance. It stores response data from requests, which could contain untrusted data. The __str__ method formats response data for output, but since response may include untrusted content, this could lead to information leakage if the exception is printed or logged without sanitization. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The code is standard exception handling for HTTP errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions for handling HTTP errors from requests. No malicious intent or malicious code behavior detected. The potential security concern is the exposure of response data via string conversion, which should be handled carefully in production to avoid information leaks.",
