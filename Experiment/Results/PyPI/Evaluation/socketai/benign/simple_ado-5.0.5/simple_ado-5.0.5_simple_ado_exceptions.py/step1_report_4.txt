{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions for handling Azure DevOps (ADO) related errors, particularly HTTP exceptions.",
  "sources": "import requests",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or external communication within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard exception class definitions, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' library and defines two custom exception classes, 'ADOException' and 'ADOHTTPException'. The latter stores an error message and an HTTP response object, and provides a string method to output detailed error info. There are no input reading points beyond importing libraries, no data manipulation, or external calls made by this code itself. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for exception handling, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a clean, standard implementation of custom exceptions for handling ADO HTTP errors. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious activities, or security risks present in this snippet.",
