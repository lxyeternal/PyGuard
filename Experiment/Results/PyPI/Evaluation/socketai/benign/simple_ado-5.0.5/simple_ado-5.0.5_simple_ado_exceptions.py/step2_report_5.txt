  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines two custom exceptions: `ADOException` and `ADOHTTPException`.\n- `ADOHTTPException` stores a message and a `requests.Response` object.\n- The `__str__` method outputs the message along with `response.status_code` and `response.text`.\n- No external input handling or complex data flows are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exceptions for ADO errors.\n- Analysis: Accurate; no malicious behavior or risks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar, defines exceptions, notes potential concern about exposing response data.\n- Analysis: Correctly notes that `__str__` exposes response data, which could leak sensitive info if logged improperly.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (due to potential info leak)\n- **Verdict:** Valid observation; no malware, just a standard pattern with a note on cautious handling.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, emphasizes response data exposure.\n- Analysis: Consistent with others; no malicious activity, just standard exception pattern.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same, highlights standard exception class.\n- Analysis: Accurate; no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same, confirms no malicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Correct; straightforward exception classes.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a standard exception class setup.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal; the only concern is response data exposure via `__str__`, which is acknowledged in the reports. This is a common pattern but should be handled carefully in production logging.\n\n### Final Scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** Given the standard pattern and the potential for response data exposure, a risk score of **0.2** is appropriate, aligning with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for handling ADO HTTP errors. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The only consideration is to handle logging of response data carefully to avoid leaking sensitive information, but this is a common concern and not indicative of malicious activity.**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code content.",
