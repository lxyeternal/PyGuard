  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- **Reports 1, 4, 5:**  \n  - Purpose: Define custom exceptions for ADO errors, including HTTP exceptions.  \n  - Sources: Static strings, response objects.  \n  - Sinks: Response status and text are included in string representations.  \n  - Anomalies: None detected.  \n  - Analysis: Straightforward exception classes, storing message and response, with no malicious or obfuscated code. Potential minor security concern about leaking response data if logged or displayed, but this is standard in error handling.  \n  - Conclusion: Benign, standard exception handling code, no malware or security risks.\n\n- **Reports 2, 3:**  \n  - Similar to above, with emphasis on the fact that response data could contain untrusted content, which might leak sensitive info if printed or logged.  \n  - No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns detected.  \n  - The security risk is rated at 0.2, which is reasonable given the potential for data leakage if response content is sensitive.\n\n**Code Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does **not** read external input beyond exception data; it does not perform network requests or process untrusted data directly.  \n- The response object is passed in from outside, likely from a request made elsewhere in the application.  \n- The string representation accesses response attributes, which could contain untrusted data, but this is typical in exception handling and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation:**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the code being straightforward and free of malicious or obfuscated logic.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n\n- The risk scores are generally low (around 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, primarily about information leakage if response data is sensitive. This aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured exception class setup for handling ADO-related HTTP errors.  \n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The only potential concern is response data exposure, which is a common issue in error handling but not a security breach per se.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — minor risk related to potential leakage of response data if logged or displayed carelessly.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- For production, ensure that exception messages do not leak sensitive data, or sanitize response content before logging or displaying.  \n- The current scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Risk           | 0.2                    |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
