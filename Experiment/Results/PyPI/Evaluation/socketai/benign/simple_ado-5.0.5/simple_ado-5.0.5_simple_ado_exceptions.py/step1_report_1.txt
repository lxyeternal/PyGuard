{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling Azure DevOps (ADO) related errors, including HTTP exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads potential error messages and HTTP response objects when exceptions are raised.",
  "buffers": "No explicit untrusted data sources are present; the code does not read external input directly, aside from exception data.",
  "flows": "Exceptions may be raised with messages and response objects, but there are no complex data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple exception hierarchy for ADO-related errors, specifically capturing HTTP responses. The __init__ method assigns message and response, with a custom __str__ method for string representation. No external input handling or data processing occurs within this snippet. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured exception class setup without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard exception class definition for handling ADO-related errors, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
