  "purpose": "Define a decorator to create a click command with a custom Shell class for use in click_shell.",
  "sources": "Importing click module, function parameters, setting default attributes, returning a click command",
  "sinks": "click.command function invocation, setting attributes for command creation",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> click.command -> command creation and return",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code, no dynamic execution or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the click module and a Shell class, defines a decorator 'shell' that sets the 'cls' attribute to Shell if not provided, and then creates a click command with the given name and attributes. The decorator simplifies command creation with a custom Shell class. No untrusted data sources or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom click commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple decorator for creating click commands with a custom shell class. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and secure.",
