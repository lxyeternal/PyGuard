{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator for creating command-line interface commands using the click library, specifically wrapping commands to use a custom Shell class.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'click' library and the local '.core' module to import the Shell class.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The function 'shell' takes optional parameters, sets a default 'cls' attribute to Shell, and returns a click command with specified attributes, but does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for defining decorators.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a decorator 'shell' that creates a click command with a specified class. It sets 'cls' to Shell by default and returns the command object. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or obfuscated constructs. The code is typical for CLI command setup and does not perform any network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, intended for setting up CLI commands with a custom shell class. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
