  "purpose": "Decorator to create click commands with a default Shell class, simplifying CLI command registration.",
  "sources": "Import of 'click' module and local '.core.Shell' class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "The decorator sets default attributes and returns a click command; no untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward decorator that wraps 'click.command', setting 'cls' to a custom 'Shell' class by default. It does not process untrusted input, execute code dynamically, or perform any network or file operations. The code structure is clear, standard, and intended for CLI command setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility decorator for CLI commands. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
