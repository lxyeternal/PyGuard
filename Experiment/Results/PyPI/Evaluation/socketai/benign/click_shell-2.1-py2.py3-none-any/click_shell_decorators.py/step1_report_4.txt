{
  "purpose": "This code defines decorators to simplify the usage of the click_shell library by creating commands that utilize a custom Shell class.",
  "sources": "The code imports the click library and a local core module, then defines a decorator function that creates a click command with a specified class.",
  "sinks": "The code creates and returns a click command object, which could potentially execute functions or code when invoked, but no untrusted data handling or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines a decorator function that returns a configured command object without processing external input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code uses standard library functions and simple decorator logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a decorator that sets a default class parameter to a custom Shell class, and creates a click command with optional attributes. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious code constructs, and no apparent malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for creating click commands with a custom shell class. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
