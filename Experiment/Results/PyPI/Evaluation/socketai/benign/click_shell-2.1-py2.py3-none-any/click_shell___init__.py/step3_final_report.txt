{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an extension to the 'click' library, providing functions and classes to facilitate shell utility creation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.core and .decorators), static version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external calls, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports specific functions/classes and defines __all__ and __version__. It contains no data processing, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All signals indicate benign intent, with no anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer for a 'click' extension, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
