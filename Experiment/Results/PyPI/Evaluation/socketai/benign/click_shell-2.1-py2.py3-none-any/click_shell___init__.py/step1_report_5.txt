{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an extension to the 'click' library, providing functionalities to convert a click-based CLI application into a shell utility.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions and classes from local modules (.core and .decorators). No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; no untrusted data handling or external communications are implemented.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely defines and exports functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The version string is static and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific functions and classes, declares an export list, and defines a version number. It lacks any data input handling, network communication, or executable logic beyond simple assignments and imports. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks are evident in this minimal setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard module designed to extend click functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code within this fragment.",
