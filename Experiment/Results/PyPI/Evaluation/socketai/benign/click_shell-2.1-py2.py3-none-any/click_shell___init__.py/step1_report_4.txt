{
  "purpose": "This code provides an extension to the 'click' library for creating shell utilities, exposing functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core and .decorators), and the __version__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output handling; no sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and classes, then exposes them via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. No dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The module imports specific functions and classes from local modules, sets an explicit version, and defines an __all__ list for exports. It serves as a straightforward interface without any code that interacts with user input, external data, or system resources. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file tampering, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be purely structural, intended for API exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module setup for a click extension, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe based on this fragment.",
