{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities for Python 2.6 and 3.x for the click_shell module.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, importing modules (readline, click, click._bashcomplete, click.shell_completion), and functions get_input, get_method_type, resolve_ctx, get_choices.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing code based on module imports and dynamic function resolutions, but no untrusted data processing or system modifications are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input sources: sys.version_info, module imports, dynamic import fallbacks. Data flows into get_input, get_method_type, resolve_ctx, get_choices, primarily through function calls and module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains fallback import logic for missing modules, which is normal. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are evident. The get_choices function adapts behavior based on module availability, but does not execute untrusted code or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes compatibility across Python versions, dynamically imports modules, and defines functions that depend on module availability. The fallback mechanisms for imports and function definitions are standard practices for compatibility. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious system modifications are present. The use of dynamic imports and function definitions is benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a compatibility layer for different Python versions and click library versions. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or system manipulation. The code's structure and logic are standard for compatibility purposes and do not indicate malicious intent.",
