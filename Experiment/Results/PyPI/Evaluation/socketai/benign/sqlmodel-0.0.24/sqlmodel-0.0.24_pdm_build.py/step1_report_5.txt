  "purpose": "Configure package build settings and dependencies based on environment variables and project metadata during the build process.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), context.config data, metadata, and configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to context.config.build_config and metadata, which influence package build and dependency resolution.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or config data -> metadata and build_config modifications during function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed. Use of environment variables is typical for configuration, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from environment variables, context objects, and dictionaries. It then modifies metadata and build configurations accordingly. The flow appears to be a standard build setup process without any suspicious or malicious actions. No network activity, credential handling, or backdoors are present. The code primarily manipulates configuration data for package building purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for a build process, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain malware or malicious intent based on the provided fragment.",
