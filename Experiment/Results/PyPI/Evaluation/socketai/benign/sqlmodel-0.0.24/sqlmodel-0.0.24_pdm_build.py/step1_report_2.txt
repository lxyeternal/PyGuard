  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'TIANGOLO_BUILD_PACKAGE' to select configuration; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads environment variables and configuration data, then modifies the build and metadata configuration for a package build process. There are no suspicious functions such as network access, file system modifications beyond configuration, or dynamic code execution. It manages dependencies and build options based on the environment and project data. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns detected. The environment variable is used to select package configuration, which is a common practice, not inherently malicious. No signs of backdoors, data theft, or malicious commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration management for a build process without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. It relies on environment variables and configuration data to set up the build, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior.",
