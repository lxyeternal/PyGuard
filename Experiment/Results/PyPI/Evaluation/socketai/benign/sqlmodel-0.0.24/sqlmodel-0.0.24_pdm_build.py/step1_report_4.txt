  "purpose": "Configure and initialize package build settings by reading environment variables, context, and configuration data, and override default metadata and dependencies accordingly.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TIANGOLO_BUILD_PACKAGE', context.config, context.config.metadata, context.config.data, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to context.config.build_config, modification of metadata and dependencies lists.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TIANGOLO_BUILD_PACKAGE' -> reading config data -> modifying context.config and metadata -> extending dependencies list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of environment variables is standard for configuration. No suspicious or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads configuration data from environment variables and context objects, then updates package metadata and build settings accordingly. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The operations are typical for build configuration scripts. Dependencies are extended in a controlled manner based on configuration, with no signs of malicious injection or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for package build setup. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The use of environment variables and config data is typical and safe. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected.",
