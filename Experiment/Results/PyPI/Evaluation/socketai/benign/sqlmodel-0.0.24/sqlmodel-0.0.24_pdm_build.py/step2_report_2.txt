  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily for configuration management during package build.\n- They consistently state that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- The environment variable 'TIANGOLO_BUILD_PACKAGE' is used to select configuration data, which is standard practice.\n- No reports mention network activity, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or other malicious behaviors.\n- The scores for malware are all 0, and the security risk scores are low (mostly 0.2 or below).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated logic.\n- It performs straightforward configuration updates based on environment variables and external data.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard build configuration script.\n- The only potential concern could be reliance on external configuration data, but this is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware scores**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All assign 0, which seems appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores**: Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal risk. Given the absence of malicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are observed, increasing the malware or security risk scores would be unjustified.\n- The code's purpose is configuration management, which is inherently low risk.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code relies on environment variables and external configuration data but do not interpret this as malicious.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent or vulnerability based on the code provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (very low, standard configuration script)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, straightforward build configuration script. It uses environment variables and external configuration data to modify package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a very low security risk score (around 0.2) to reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**This analysis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's purpose.**",
