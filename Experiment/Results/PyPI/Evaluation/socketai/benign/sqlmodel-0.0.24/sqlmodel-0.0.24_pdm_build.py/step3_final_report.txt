{
  "purpose": "This code manages build configuration by reading environment variables and external configuration data to update package metadata, dependencies, and build settings during the build process.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TIANGOLO_BUILD_PACKAGE', 'context.config.data', and 'metadata' dictionary entries.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to 'metadata', 'context.config.build_config', and dependency lists based on configuration data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and configuration data are read as sources; updates are made to 'metadata' and 'build_config' as sinks; data flows from sources to sinks during configuration updates.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks, reading environment variables and external configuration data to update package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, typical build script behavior. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's purpose aligns with legitimate build processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe build configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
