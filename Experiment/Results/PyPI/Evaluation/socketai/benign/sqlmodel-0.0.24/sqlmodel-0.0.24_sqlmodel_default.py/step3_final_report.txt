  "purpose": "Utility for internal default value recognition using a placeholder class and a factory function.",
  "sources": "The class _DefaultPlaceholder reads the 'value' attribute; the function Default returns an instance of this class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not perform I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to 'value' in _DefaultPlaceholder; no flow to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple internal mechanism for recognizing overwritten default values, with no network, file, or environment interactions. It contains no malicious or suspicious constructs, and is a common pattern in Python. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Given the code's clarity and purpose, the risk and malware scores should be zero, and confidence is high that the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for internal default handling, with no security issues or malicious intent. The empty reports do not indicate any vulnerabilities or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
