  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The reports indicate \"Empty response\" for all five reports, meaning no detailed content or findings are provided.\n- Since the code is fully visible and appears to be standard Python code defining a utility class and function, there are no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- Without additional context or specific issues reported, there's no evidence of security flaws, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports contain no substantive information—only \"Empty response.\"\n- No reasoning, analysis, or findings are provided to evaluate.\n- Therefore, there's no logical flaw or mistake in the reports themselves, but the lack of content prevents any meaningful assessment.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue and suggest changes**\n\n- Since no issues are described, no scores are assigned or need adjustment.\n- The absence of data suggests the reports are incomplete or improperly generated.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No issues or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to be a simple utility for internal default value handling.\n- Therefore, risk scores should be minimal, close to zero.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or code execution.\n- No malicious activity is evident.\n- Malware score should be zero.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- Since no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are described, there's no basis for assuming potential vulnerabilities.\n- The code is straightforward and seems safe.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- No scores are provided, but based on the above, any scoring should reflect the absence of issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (the code is clear and readable)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security issues identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The reports are empty; thus, no security concerns can be inferred.\n- The code itself is a standard pattern for handling default values internally, common in Python projects.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and the reports, there are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are incomplete, but the code appears safe and well-structured.",
