{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations, overloads, and a select function for constructing SQL select statements with type safety using SQLAlchemy.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines classes, type variables, and a function for constructing query objects.",
  "sinks": "The select function takes arbitrary entities as arguments and constructs query objects; these entities are used to form SQL queries.",
  "flows": "The function select processes input entities (sources) to produce query objects (sinks). No external untrusted data is processed within the code; the flow is purely internal.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains generated type variables and multiple overloads to handle different argument combinations. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated code features. The initial comment warns not to modify generated code, indicating this is auto-generated boilerplate, not malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type safety and overloads for a select function, enabling strongly typed query construction with SQLAlchemy. It does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The code appears to be purely for type-safe query building, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a type-safe SQL query builder boilerplate generated by a template. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and purpose are legitimate, focused on type annotations and query construction helpers.",
