  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code is primarily type annotations, overloads, and a factory function for constructing SQLAlchemy query objects.  \n   - No actual runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.  \n   - No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   - The code is heavily auto-generated with multiple overloads, which is typical for type safety in Python.  \n   - No evident logical flaws or vulnerabilities.  \n   - The purpose is to provide type annotations and overloads for the `select` function.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - The confidence levels are high, consistent with the straightforward, generated nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \n   - Since the code is purely type annotations and boilerplate for SQL query construction, there is no reason to assign higher risk or malware scores.  \n   - No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data leaks, or obfuscated code.  \n   - The code is safe and intended for use as a helper utility.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the reports correctly identify the code as generated boilerplate for type safety.  \n   - No hidden malicious logic or backdoors are suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature: no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n   - The high confidence scores reflect the clear, benign purpose of the code.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard, generated utility for type-safe SQL query building with SQLAlchemy.  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.  \n- The malware score should remain at 0.  \n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, as there's no obfuscation.  \n- The overall security risk is minimal, around 0.1 at most, which is appropriate.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the benign nature)  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's purpose.",
