  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is heavily generated, primarily consisting of type annotations, overloads, and a simple `select` function.\n- It uses standard Python typing, SQLAlchemy constructs, and no runtime logic beyond returning query objects.\n- No network activity, system modifications, or obfuscation are present.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type-safe SQL query construction, not execute any malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a safe, generated module for type-safe SQLAlchemy query building. No malicious behavior, secrets, or backdoors detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — low, given the nature of code, but the score reflects minimal residual concern.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's purpose as a boilerplate for type-safe SQL queries. No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign, generated utility for SQL query construction with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a boilerplate for type-safe SQL queries, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. Slightly less confident but still accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign helper for SQLAlchemy query construction, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall analysis:**\n\n- The code is **not** obfuscated, contains **no** embedded secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The purpose is purely to provide type annotations and overloads for a SQLAlchemy-based select function.\n- The code does **not** perform any runtime actions that could be malicious.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set at 0 across all reports, consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate, which aligns with the reports.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or very close to it)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is safe, generated boilerplate for type-safe SQL query building, with no malicious or security risks detected.",
