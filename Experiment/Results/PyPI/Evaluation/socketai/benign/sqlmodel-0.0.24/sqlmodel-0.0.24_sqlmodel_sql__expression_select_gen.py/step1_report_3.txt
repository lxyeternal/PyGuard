{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations, overloads, and a factory function for constructing SQL SELECT statements using SQLAlchemy. It is generated boilerplate code to facilitate type-safe query construction.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from function parameters (entities), which are passed to the 'select' function.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the instantiation of Select or SelectOfScalar objects with provided entities, used to build SQL queries.",
  "flows": "Entities provided to 'select' function flow into the constructor of Select or SelectOfScalar, leading to SQL query object creation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual behavior. It is a generated boilerplate for type-safe query building with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden actions. No external data sources or network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily type annotations, overload definitions, and a factory function for creating SQL query objects. It uses standard Python typing features and SQLAlchemy constructs without any suspicious or malicious logic. No code injection, data leakage, or system access occurs. The comment warns not to modify generated code, indicating it is boilerplate. The code's purpose is clear, and there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, generated code module intended to facilitate type-safe SQL query construction. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
