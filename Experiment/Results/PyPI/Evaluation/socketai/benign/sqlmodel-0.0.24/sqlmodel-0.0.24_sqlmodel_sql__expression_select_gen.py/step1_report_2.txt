{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations, overloads, and a select function for building SQL select queries with type safety in Python, using SQLAlchemy components.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (__ent0, __ent1, etc.) and type annotations for entities used in select queries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if input data is dynamically generated or manipulated; no direct data sinks like network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input entities flow into the select function, which creates Select or SelectOfScalar objects, but there are no explicit data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily auto-generated with extensive overloads for type safety; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type annotations, overloads, and a factory function for constructing SQL SELECT queries in a type-safe manner. It uses standard Python features (typing, overloading) and SQLAlchemy classes, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. There are no data leaks, external network calls, or system modifications. The comments indicate the code is auto-generated, and all components appear to serve a purely type-related purpose, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a generated utility for type-safe SQL query construction. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign, auto-generated helper module for a larger database application.",
