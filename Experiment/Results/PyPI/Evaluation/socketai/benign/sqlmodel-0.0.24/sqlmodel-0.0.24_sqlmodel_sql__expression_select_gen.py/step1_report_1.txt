{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations, overloads, and a select function for constructing SQL select statements with type safety, likely for use with SQLAlchemy.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via function arguments and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The select function receives input entities which are used to build SQL statements; these are internally handled by SQLAlchemy objects.",
  "flows": "Input entities flow into the select function, which then creates and returns either a Select or SelectOfScalar object based on the number of arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is heavily reliant on type annotations and generated overloads, but there is no malicious behavior apparent. No network activity, system modifications, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of type definitions, overloads for the select function, and the function implementation itself. It is generated code intended for type-safe SQL query construction, not executing any runtime malicious behavior. It uses standard imports from datetime, uuid, and SQLAlchemy modules. The select function distinguishes between single and multiple entities to return appropriate objects. There are no code injection, data leakage, or suspicious system calls. No indications of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, generated module for facilitating type-safe SQL query building with SQLAlchemy. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is solely to provide type annotations and overloads for the select function. Overall, the code is safe.",
