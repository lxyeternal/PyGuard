  "purpose": "Generated type annotations and overloads for SQLAlchemy's select function to facilitate type-safe query construction.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, overload definitions, and the select function handling various argument combinations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input entities (columns, expressions) flow into the select function, which returns query objects; no runtime data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is generated boilerplate with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated utility for type-safe SQLAlchemy query building, consisting solely of type annotations, overloads, and a simple select function. It does not perform any runtime actions, network activity, or data processing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there are no malicious elements. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation. The security risk score is low (~0.1), appropriate for a benign utility module. The high confidence scores are justified given the code's straightforward, generated nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, generated utility for type-safe SQL query construction with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
