  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are evident in this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. No suspicious language features or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a single import of a specific class from a well-known library. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows, and no unusual or suspicious code patterns. The imported class may be used later in the project, but in this snippet alone, there are no security concerns or signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement importing a class from sqlalchemy. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
