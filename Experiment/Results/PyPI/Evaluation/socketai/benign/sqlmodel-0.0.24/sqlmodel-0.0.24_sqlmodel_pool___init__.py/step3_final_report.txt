  "purpose": "Import the StaticPool class from sqlalchemy.pool, likely for database connection pooling configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from sqlalchemy.pool module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; only a module import.",
  "flows": "No data flow; import is static and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a noqa comment to suppress unused import warning; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing StaticPool from sqlalchemy.pool, with a linter suppression comment. It does not execute any code, handle data, or perform network operations. The import is from a reputable, widely used library. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, representing a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports' evaluations and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
