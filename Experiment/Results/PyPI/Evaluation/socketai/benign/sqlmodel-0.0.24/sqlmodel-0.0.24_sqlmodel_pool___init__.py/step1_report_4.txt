  "purpose": "Importing the StaticPool class from SQLAlchemy's pool module, likely for database connection pooling.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; just an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with a comment to ignore linter warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class (StaticPool) from SQLAlchemy's pool module, which is used for database connection pooling strategies. The comment indicates suppression of linter warnings about unused imports. There is no evidence of any malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity in this single line. It is a standard import statement common in database-related Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign import statement for a SQLAlchemy class used in database connection pooling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
