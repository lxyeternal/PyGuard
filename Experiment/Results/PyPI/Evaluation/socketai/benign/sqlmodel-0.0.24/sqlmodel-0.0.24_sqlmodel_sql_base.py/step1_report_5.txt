{
  "purpose": "Define a generic subclass of SQLAlchemy's Executable class for type safety or extension purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from typing and sqlalchemy.sql.base, specifically reading the Executable class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths that handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; the class is a simple extension with no additional logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for type annotations and SQLAlchemy core functionality. It defines a subclass 'Executable' that extends '_Executable' from SQLAlchemy and makes it generic over type '_T'. The class contains no methods or additional logic, serving as a type-safe wrapper or extension. No data handling, input reading, or potential malicious operations are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for extending SQLAlchemy classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign subclass definition intended for type safety or extension purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a standard, minimal extension of a known library class.",
