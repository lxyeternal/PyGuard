  "purpose": "Define a generic subclass 'Executable' that extends SQLAlchemy's '_Executable' class for type-safe use with different data types.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, source-to-sink paths, or untrusted data handling in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and uses standard Python typing and inheritance without obfuscation or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple subclass 'Executable' that is a generic wrapper around SQLAlchemy's '_Executable' class. It leverages Python's type variables for type safety. There are no data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The code structure is clear, and it relies on standard library and third-party library inheritance. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of SQLAlchemy's '_Executable' class, intended for generic type safety. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
