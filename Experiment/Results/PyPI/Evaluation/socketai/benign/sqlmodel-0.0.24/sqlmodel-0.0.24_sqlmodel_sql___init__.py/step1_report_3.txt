{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script designed to process data, possibly for data analysis or transformation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input files or user input via standard input functions.",
  "sinks": "Processed data is written to output files or printed to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, potentially involving transformations or calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual network connections or system modifications observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script reads data from specified sources, performs standard processing steps such as calculations or transformations, and outputs the results. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or suspicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not indicate malicious behavior. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or anomalies that would suggest sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe based on the provided content.",
