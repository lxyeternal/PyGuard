  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, module imports, standard input/output, data processing functions, network or file operations (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, subprocess calls, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, or any untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, file system, subprocesses) through code logic.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying solely on high-level descriptions. The assessments correctly identify the absence of malicious indicators, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. Malware scores are zero, obfuscated scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal threat. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and no inconsistencies are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, the code appears benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
