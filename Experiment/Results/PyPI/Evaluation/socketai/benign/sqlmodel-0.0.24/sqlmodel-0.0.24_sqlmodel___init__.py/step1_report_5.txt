{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting and aliasing components from SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, and related modules for easier import and use within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (sqlalchemy, sqlalchemy.sql, sqlalchemy.types, and internal modules). No user input or external data sources are used directly in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is primarily import statements and re-exports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. The code strictly performs static imports and re-exports, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements that re-export components from SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, and internal modules. There are no functions, data processing, or logic that could be exploited. It does not perform any data handling, network activity, or execute dynamic code. The purpose appears to be to centralize imports for convenience. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard re-export module designed for organizational convenience. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely facilitates import management within a larger project.",
