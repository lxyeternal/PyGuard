{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a centralized module that re-exports classes, functions, and types from SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, and internal modules to facilitate easier imports and maintainability within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from well-known libraries (SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, internal modules) that do not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data flow to external systems, network, or file operations; purely static import/export statements.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow, data processing, or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hidden logic, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import and re-export statements from trusted libraries, serving as a dependency aggregator. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or network communication. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The extensive list of imports is typical for a module designed to simplify dependency management. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's static nature indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency aggregation module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence points to a safe and transparent implementation.",
