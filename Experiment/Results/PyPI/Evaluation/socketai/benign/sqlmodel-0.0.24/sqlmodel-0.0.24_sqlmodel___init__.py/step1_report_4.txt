{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports various modules, classes, functions, and types from SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, and internal project modules for simplified access and potentially to standardize dependencies across the project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and functions, primarily from third-party libraries (SQLAlchemy, SQLModel) and internal modules (.main, .orm.session, .sql.expression, .sql.sqltypes). It does not process external input data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or can cause data leaks or system effects. No database operations, network transmissions, or file manipulations are directly performed in this code.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and re-exports symbols; there are no data flows, input handling, or untrusted data processing flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is predominantly a large list of import statements and re-exports, with no complex logic, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code structure appears normal for a module that centralizes imports.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a centralized re-export module for SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, and internal project components, facilitating easier access to these symbols elsewhere in the project. It does not include any user input handling, data processing, or code execution beyond import statements. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. The imports are straightforward, and the module does not perform any operations at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical re-export module that centralizes dependencies for ease of use in the project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It appears to be safe and standard in structure.",
