  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, minimal package initializer (__init__.py) that imports internal classes and error definitions, and sets the public API.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, data processing, or external inputs are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is well-structured, documented, and standard for a Python SDK package.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- None of the reports identify any actual code behavior that could be malicious or pose security risks.\n- The code snippets are purely import/export statements with descriptive comments, typical for a package's main module.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0. The code is a standard package setup with no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or points to challenge:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The high confidence (1) in all reports is justified.\n- The absence of any suspicious code or behavior means no need to increase the malware or risk scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe package initializer with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores provided (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to a benign, standard SDK package setup. No security concerns are present in this code snippet.",
