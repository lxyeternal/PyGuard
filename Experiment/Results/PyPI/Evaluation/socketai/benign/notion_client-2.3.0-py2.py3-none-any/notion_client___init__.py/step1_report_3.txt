  "purpose": "This code defines the package's public interface and documentation for the notion-sdk-py library, providing access to client classes and error types for interacting with the Notion API.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module docstring at the beginning and imports specific classes and error types from local modules (.client and .errors).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the module docstring to the import statements, establishing the package's namespace without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code structure is standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as an entry point for the package, providing documentation and exporting key classes and error types. It imports only specific components and does not execute or evaluate untrusted data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions solely to define and expose the package API, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
