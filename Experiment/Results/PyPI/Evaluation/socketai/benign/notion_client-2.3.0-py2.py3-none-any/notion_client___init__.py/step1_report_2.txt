{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python package interface for the Notion SDK, including importing client classes and error definitions for interaction with the Notion API.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user inputs, or environment variables are read in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This module appears to be a straightforward package initializer, importing classes and error definitions for use in other parts of the application. There are no active code executions, no data processing, and no potentially malicious logic. The code is minimal, well-structured, and does not perform any suspicious operations or contain hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely exposes classes and errors for external use without any active or dangerous code. The likelihood of malware or security risks in this snippet is negligible.",
