  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, straightforward package initializer (__init__.py) that imports internal modules and exposes classes and error definitions.\n- No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted data, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: providing a public API interface for the Notion SDK.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm the code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscated or hidden logic.\n- **Security risks:** Given the code's simplicity and the absence of active logic, the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence levels are high (1), consistent with the thorough, static analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or claims to challenge:**\n- The reports seem to be based solely on static inspection of a minimal __init__.py file, which is appropriate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly notes the lack of active or suspicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** Since the code is purely a static package setup with no runtime logic, no data handling, and no external interactions, the risk remains negligible.",
