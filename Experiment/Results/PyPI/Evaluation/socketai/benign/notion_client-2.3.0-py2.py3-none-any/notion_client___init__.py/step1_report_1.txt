{
  "purpose": "Define the public interface and import key components for the notion-sdk-py package, serving as a client library for the Notion API.",
  "sources": "The module imports from local files (.client and .errors), and reads the package's initial comment documentation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is primarily defining exports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; standard import and export statements, straightforward comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initializer that documents the package purpose and exports key classes and error definitions. It imports from internal modules and sets the public API. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no network interactions are present. The initial comment provides descriptive information but no executable behavior that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization file with no malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks detected.",
