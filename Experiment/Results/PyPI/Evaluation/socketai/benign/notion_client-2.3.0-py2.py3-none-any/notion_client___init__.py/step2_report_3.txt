  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a minimal, standard package initializer (__init__.py) that imports internal classes and error definitions, and sets the public API via `__all__`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data processing, and no handling of untrusted input are present.\n   - The code consists solely of import statements, documentation comments, and export definitions.\n\n2. **Potential malicious activity or anomalies**:\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are observed across all reports.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package's entry point.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature—benign, non-executable, and purely declarative.\n\n4. **Any inconsistencies or questionable claims**:\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made; all assessments are aligned with the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence level is high (1) in all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Final assessment**:\n   - The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python SDK package, serving as an API surface without executing any logic or handling data.\n   - There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No changes are necessary.",
