  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a minimal, standard package initializer (`__init__.py`) that imports classes and error definitions, and sets the public API.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data processing, and no handling of untrusted input are observed.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as an entry point for the package.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**\n   - All reports explicitly state that there are no anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code does not contain any signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - The reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - There are no claims based on assumptions that could be challenged; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments seem necessary.\n   - The code's purpose is purely to expose classes and errors for external use, which is standard for a package's `__init__.py`.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate** after thorough review aligns with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign package initializer with no security concerns. All evidence points to a standard, well-structured module setup typical for Python SDKs.",
