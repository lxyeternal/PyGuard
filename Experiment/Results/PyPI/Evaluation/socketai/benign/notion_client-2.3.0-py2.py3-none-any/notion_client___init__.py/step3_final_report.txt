{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the package's __init__.py, establishing the public API by importing internal classes and error definitions for the Notion SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.client, .errors)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "N/A — static import statements with no data flow or runtime logic",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward import and export structure with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initializer that imports classes and error definitions, then exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as an API surface for the SDK. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign __init__.py for a Python SDK package, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
