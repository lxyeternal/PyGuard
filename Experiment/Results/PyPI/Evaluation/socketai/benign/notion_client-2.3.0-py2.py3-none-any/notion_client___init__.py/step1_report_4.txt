{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python package interface for the Notion SDK, allowing users to interact with Notion's API via sync and async clients.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules 'client' and 'errors' within the same package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data output or external data use observed",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or processing logic; the code primarily exposes class and error definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file, importing classes and error definitions for user access. It contains no runtime logic, no data processing, and no external inputs or outputs. It serves as a module initializer, with clear and straightforward structure, and links to the project repository. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package initialization script for a Python SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It simply exposes SDK classes and error types for external use.",
