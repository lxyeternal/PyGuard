  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper for Notion, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent with a benign API client.\n- **Justification for scores:** The low risk score is appropriate; the malware score is zero because no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard API wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code or behaviors; the low risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also a typical API client wrapper, with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal risk.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; the low risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard API wrapper, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected; risk score is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also a typical API wrapper; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent; low risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with a well-structured API wrapper.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Notion API client wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the current scores and analysis are appropriate.",
