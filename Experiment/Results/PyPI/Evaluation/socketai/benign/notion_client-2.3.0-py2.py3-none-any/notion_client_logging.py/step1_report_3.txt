{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom logging setup for the notion-sdk-py package, enabling console logging.",
  "sources": "The function 'make_console_logger' reads the __package__ variable to determine the logger's name, and sets up a StreamHandler for output.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that send untrusted data outside the system. It only configures logging handlers locally.",
  "flows": "The source (__package__) is used to configure the logger; however, it does not process untrusted input. The logger outputs logs to the console via StreamHandler.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code uses standard logging patterns without hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a logger associated with the current package, adds a stream handler, and formats log messages with the default format. There are no external data sources or sinks beyond standard logging. No unusual language features or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library features appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign logging setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not process or transmit untrusted data beyond logging to the console.",
