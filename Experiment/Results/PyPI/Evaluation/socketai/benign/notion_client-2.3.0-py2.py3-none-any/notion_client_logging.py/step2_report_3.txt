  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippets across all reports are identical or very similar.\n- The code creates a logger named after the package, adds a StreamHandler, and sets a formatter with `logging.BASIC_FORMAT`.\n- No external data, secrets, or network activity is involved.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The only minor point is the use of `logging.BASIC_FORMAT` as the formatter string, which is standard but somewhat unconventional (it's a string constant, not a formatter object). However, this is a common pattern in logging setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **In the second report**, it mentions that `logging.BASIC_FORMAT` is \"unusual\" as a formatter string, but this is actually standard practice. It's a string constant for the default format, so this is not a flaw.\n- **In the third report**, the securityRisk score is 0.1, which seems to suggest a minor concern, but no actual risk exists.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate; 0.1 is slightly overestimating unless considering the formatter string as a minor concern.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- **None of the reports** justifies a risk score higher than 0.5. The code is benign; no external data, secrets, or malicious behavior. Even the minor concern about the formatter string does not warrant a high risk score.\n\n### Additional points:\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or assumptions that are unfounded.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's security profile.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard logging setup with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and standard.\n- No malware or obfuscation present.\n- Minor point about the formatter string is not a concern.\n- Scores should all be 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n**My recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
