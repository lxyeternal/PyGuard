  "flows": "The function retrieves __package__, sets up a formatter, attaches it to the handler, and adds the handler to the logger.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. Uses standard logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates a logger for console output. It uses standard Python logging libraries and standard formatter. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read. No data is transmitted or stored externally. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
