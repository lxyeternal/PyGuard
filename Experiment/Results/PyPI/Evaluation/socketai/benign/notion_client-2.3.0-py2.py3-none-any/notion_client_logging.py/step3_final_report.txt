{
  "purpose": "Create a console logger with a StreamHandler and a formatter using logging.BASIC_FORMAT.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __package__ variable for logger naming, and uses logging.BASIC_FORMAT as the formatter string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external data, or network communication; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "The logger is created with a name based on __package__, a StreamHandler is attached, and a formatter is set with logging.BASIC_FORMAT.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __package__ is standard; the formatter uses logging.BASIC_FORMAT, which is typical; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger named after the package, adds a console stream handler, and applies a default formatter. It does not process untrusted input, perform external communication, or contain obfuscation. The use of __package__ is standard in package modules. The formatter string logging.BASIC_FORMAT is a constant, not an obfuscation. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common logging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal risk scores assigned in some reports are slightly overestimated; a score of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk is appropriate.",
