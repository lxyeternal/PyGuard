{
  "purpose": "Create a custom console logger for the notion-sdk-py package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or data sources; it only creates and configures a logger.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leak points or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting up a logger with a stream handler and formatter, with no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'logging.BASIC_FORMAT' as the formatter string is unusual, as 'BASIC_FORMAT' is typically a constant for the format string, not a formatter object. However, this is a standard usage within the logging module and not suspicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up a logger that outputs to the console. It creates a logger, adds a stream handler, and sets a formatter using the built-in 'logging.BASIC_FORMAT'. The code does not handle external data, secrets, or perform any risky operations. The implementation appears straightforward and safe, focused solely on logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup for logging in a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
