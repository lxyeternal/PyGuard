{
  "purpose": "Create a custom console logger for the notion-sdk-py package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name from __package__ and creates a stream handler for logging.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or passed to external systems.",
  "flows": "The module name (__package__) is used as the logger name; the logger outputs to the console via StreamHandler.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no external data retrieval, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a logger with a stream handler and a formatter. It uses __package__ as the logger name, which is standard. The formatter uses the BASIC_FORMAT for logging output. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external network calls, and no manipulations or obfuscations. The code appears straightforward, intended for logging purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for setting up console logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
