  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code snippet is a straightforward logging setup: it creates a logger, attaches a StreamHandler, and sets a formatter.\n- The code uses `__package__` to name the logger, which is standard practice.\n- There are no signs of data processing, external data retrieval, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1 or close, and malware scores of 0.\n- Some reports note the use of `logging.BASIC_FORMAT`, which is typical, not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, standard, and does not process untrusted data.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal; only potential concern is if `__package__` could be manipulated, but in standard usage, it's safe.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data leaks or external communication:** Not present.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1—this is a very minor, perhaps overly cautious, acknowledgment of the minimal risk involved in using `__package__` for logger naming, which is standard and safe.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The **security risk score** could be uniformly set to 0, given the benign nature.\n- The **malware score** should remain 0.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nBased on the review, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign logging setup with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are reasonable, but the security risk score could be adjusted downward to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**  \nAlways consider context; in this case, the code is straightforward and safe. No further action needed.",
