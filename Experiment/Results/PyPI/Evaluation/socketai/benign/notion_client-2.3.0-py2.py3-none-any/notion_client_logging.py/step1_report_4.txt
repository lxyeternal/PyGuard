  "purpose": "Create a custom console logger for the notion-sdk-py package to facilitate logging output.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; uses internal functions and standard logging module.",
  "sinks": "Outputs logs to the console via StreamHandler; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flow involved; only logger creation and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses logging.getLogger with __package__, which is standard; no secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, defines a function to create and configure a logger that outputs to the console. It uses the package's name as the logger name and sets up a StreamHandler with a formatter. The code is straightforward, typical for setting up logging in Python, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. No external data sources or sinks indicate a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard logging setup without any malicious or suspicious features. It is safe and contains no indicators of malware or security risks.",
