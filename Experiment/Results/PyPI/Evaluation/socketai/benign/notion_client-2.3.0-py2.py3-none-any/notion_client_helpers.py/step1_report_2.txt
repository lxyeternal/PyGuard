{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for interacting with Notion SDK, including URL handling, pagination, and response type checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (e.g., URLs, API responses), environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs (e.g., URL generation, ID extraction), no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions for processing URLs and API responses; no dangerous data flows or external calls are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic code execution or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides safe utility functions for URL parsing, ID handling, pagination, and response type checking. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic without suspicious patterns. The only potential concern is the use of UUID conversion in get_url and get_id, but this is consistent with typical ID handling. No external system calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility functions for the Notion SDK with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk is low.",
