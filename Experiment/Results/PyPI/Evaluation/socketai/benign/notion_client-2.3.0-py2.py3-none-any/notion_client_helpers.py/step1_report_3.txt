  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with Notion SDK, including pagination, URL parsing, and response type checks.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (e.g., function calls, response dictionaries), URL inputs, response data from API calls.",
  "sinks": "URL parsing, response data handling, and return statements.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters or responses flow through parsing, condition checks, and return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of standard libraries and typical API interaction patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of helper functions for handling API responses, pagination, URL parsing, and response type checks. It uses standard Python features, safe URL parsing, and no external or insecure data handling. The functions that generate URLs or parse IDs do not execute untrusted code. The asynchronous functions handle pagination with await statements properly. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic identified. All operations are typical for API helper modules and do not include any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module for Notion SDK interactions. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It follows standard practices for API response handling and data parsing.",
