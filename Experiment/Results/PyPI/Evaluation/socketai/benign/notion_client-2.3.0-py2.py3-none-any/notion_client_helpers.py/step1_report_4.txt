  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with the Notion SDK, including data extraction, URL parsing, and paginated API handling.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, response dictionaries, URL strings, environment variables (none explicitly shown), and function calls to external APIs.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to external APIs, data returns, and potential string manipulations involving URLs and IDs.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters and API responses flows through validation, parsing, and iteration functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward utility functions. However, there is a potential issue in `async_iterate_paginated_api` with a bitwise operator `|` used instead of a logical `or`, which may cause logical errors but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data processing, URL parsing, pagination handling, and response validation functions. The functions do not perform any network requests directly; they are utilities meant to be used with external API calls. No signs of malware, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code, are present. The only noteworthy point is the misuse of the bitwise operator in `async_iterate_paginated_api`, which could cause logical issues but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code is typical for SDK utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard utility functions for the Notion SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor issue is the misuse of the bitwise operator, which should be replaced with a logical operator for correct behavior but does not pose a security threat.",
