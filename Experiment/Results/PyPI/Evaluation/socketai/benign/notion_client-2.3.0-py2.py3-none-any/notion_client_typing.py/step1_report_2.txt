  "purpose": "Define custom type annotations for asynchronous and synchronous operations in the notion-sdk-py package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from typing module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines type variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type aliasing and variable definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing constructs Awaitable, TypeVar, and Union to define a generic type variable T and a Union type SyncAsync that can be either T or an Awaitable of T. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution flows. It is a simple type aliasing for use elsewhere in the package. No external data, credentials, or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a basic type definition for asynchronous and synchronous types in the package. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior and appears to be standard, benign type annotation code.",
