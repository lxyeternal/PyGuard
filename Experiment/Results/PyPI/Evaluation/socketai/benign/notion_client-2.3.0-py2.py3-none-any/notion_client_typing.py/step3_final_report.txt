  "purpose": "Define a generic type variable T and a union type alias SyncAsync supporting both T and Awaitable[T] for type hinting in Python.",
  "sources": "Import of Awaitable, TypeVar, Union from typing; definition of T and SyncAsync.",
  "sinks": "None; the code is static and used solely for type annotations.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or runtime execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing utilities, defines a generic type variable T, and creates a union type alias SyncAsync for supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions. It is a minimal, static pattern used for type hinting, with no external data, no dynamic behavior, and no security concerns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and full confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type aliasing pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe. No modifications are necessary.",
