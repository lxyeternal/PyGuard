  "purpose": "Define custom type annotations for asynchronous and synchronous usage in the notion-sdk-py package.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'typing' module: Awaitable, TypeVar, Union.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward type aliasing with no suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing constructs to define a generic type variable 'T' and a union type 'SyncAsync' that can be either a synchronous or asynchronous version of 'T'. It is simple, clean, and adheres to standard Python type hinting practices. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns. No external data handling, secret usage, or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines type aliases for use in the 'notion-sdk-py' project. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. It is a benign snippet focused on type hinting.",
