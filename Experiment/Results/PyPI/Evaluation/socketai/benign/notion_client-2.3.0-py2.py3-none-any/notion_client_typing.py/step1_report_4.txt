  "purpose": "Define custom type aliases for the notion-sdk-py to support synchronous and asynchronous usage.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads; type definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leaks; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply type aliasing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hinting components and defines a generic type variable T. It then creates a union type alias SyncAsync that can be either a type T or an Awaitable of T. This is a common pattern in Python for supporting both synchronous and asynchronous code. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign type alias definition intended for clarity and flexibility in API usage. There is no malicious intent or security risk detected.",
