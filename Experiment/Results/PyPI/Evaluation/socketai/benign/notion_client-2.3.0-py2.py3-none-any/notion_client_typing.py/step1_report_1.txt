{
  "purpose": "Define custom type aliases for the notion-sdk-py package to facilitate type hinting for synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from standard library imports: typing's Awaitable, TypeVar, Union.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input, as this code only defines type variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward type aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hinting utilities from the typing module and defines a generic type variable T. It then creates a union type SyncAsync that can be either T or Awaitable[T], allowing functions to specify return types that may be synchronous or asynchronous. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard and benign, focusing solely on type definitions for better code clarity and type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign type alias definition for supporting both sync and async functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
