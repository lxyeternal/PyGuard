  "purpose": "Define custom type annotations for the notion-sdk-py library to support synchronous and asynchronous usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'Awaitable', 'TypeVar', and 'Union'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Type variable definition linking 'T' with 'Awaitable[T]' through 'Union', facilitating flexible function annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward type aliasing without any suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hinting features from the 'typing' module, defines a generic type variable 'T', and creates a union type 'SyncAsync' that can represent either a value of type 'T' or an awaitable returning 'T'. This pattern supports functions that can operate synchronously or asynchronously. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for type annotations. No external inputs, outputs, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign type annotation setup for supporting sync/async flexibility in the library. No malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation are detected.",
