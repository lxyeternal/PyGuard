  "purpose": "Implementation of synchronous and asynchronous clients for Notion's API, handling request construction, response parsing, and error management.",
  "sources": "Request parameters, headers, and response data from the HTTP client, including auth tokens and request bodies.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request sending functions, response parsing, and error raising points that could potentially expose sensitive data if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into request building functions, which then send data over the network; responses flow back into parsing functions, with error handling as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Standard patterns used throughout.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client with proper error handling, request building, and response parsing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. Use of standard libraries and patterns suggests legitimate intent. The request construction correctly manages headers and parameters, and response parsing uses appropriate error handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity identified. The security and malware scores are consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Notion API client with no malicious or obfuscated components. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to standard request handling. The assigned malware score of 0 and low risk scores are justified and accurate.",
