{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors in the notion-sdk-py, including request timeouts, HTTP errors, and API-specific error codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the httpx.Response object and internally defines exception classes with attributes populated from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the code could leak response bodies or headers if exceptions are not handled properly, but it does not explicitly write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "HTTPResponseError and APIResponseError extract status, headers, and body from httpx.Response objects; is_api_error_code checks error code strings against predefined enum values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code strictly defines exception classes and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The module provides standard exception classes for handling HTTP and API errors, with attributes to store response details. No code executes external commands, network connections, or manipulates untrusted input directly. It relies on the httpx library, but usage appears standard. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration logic. The code's structure and functions are typical for an API client error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured exception handling module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves its purpose to manage API errors securely. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected.",
