  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and error codes for API error handling; no malicious behavior or anomalies are present.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected. The code is straightforward, with proper exception handling.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's structure, validation, and lack of malicious intent. Slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still high.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95, obfuscated=0  \n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 suggests minimal concern, possibly due to the potential for response data leakage if exceptions are mishandled, but no actual malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No malware, no obfuscation, and the risk is very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the absence of malicious behavior, focusing on the code's simplicity and correctness.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95, obfuscated=0  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous reports. The minor security risk score reflects the potential if response data is mishandled, but not malicious.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard exception classes, no malicious activity, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms the code's standard structure, no malicious behavior, and proper exception definitions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on this.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low, justified by the code's nature as an error handling module—no external data exfiltration, no malicious payloads, and no suspicious logic.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module for an SDK.  \n- It uses common patterns, such as custom exceptions, enums, and response parsing.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.  \n- The minimal security risk score (0.1) reflects the potential if response data is mishandled but does not indicate actual malicious activity.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Your initial scores are appropriate.** I would maintain the malware score at **0**, obfuscated at **0**, and risk at **0.1** for the second and third reports, given the slight potential for mishandling response data but no actual security concern.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is a standard, secure error handling module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
