{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exceptions for handling errors in the notion-sdk-py library, specifically related to HTTP request issues and API error responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'enum', 'typing', and 'httpx' libraries; exception class definitions; and the function 'is_api_error_code'.",
  "sinks": "The function 'is_api_error_code' that reads input ('code') and checks membership; exception constructors that process HTTP responses and headers.",
  "flows": "Input 'response' objects in exception constructors flow into class attributes; 'code' string inputs flow into 'is_api_error_code' for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes and a utility function for error handling and validation. It relies on 'httpx' response objects and standard exception patterns. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or other malware activities. The structure and content are typical for error handling modules. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling module for an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network operations or contain sensitive data. The risk of malware or malicious intent is very low.",
