  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's purpose, structure, and potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines custom exceptions for HTTP timeouts, HTTP response errors, and API-specific errors.\n- Uses `httpx` for handling HTTP responses.\n- Defines an enum `APIErrorCode` for various API error codes.\n- Provides a utility function `is_api_error_code` to validate error codes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward, defining exception classes and utility functions.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data manipulation, or network activity beyond exception handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is purely for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious intent, well-structured.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0. No issues.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard error handling, no malicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1 (very low, just a slight concern about error handling, but acceptable).  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, no suspicious code, no external data leaks.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard exception classes, no anomalies.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard pattern, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; set to 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; set to 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. Slightly higher scores (like 0.1) in some reports seem to overstate risk from error handling code, which is inherently low risk.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal, almost negligible risk, mainly due to error handling logic but not a security concern)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code is standard, clean, and safe.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, though I would keep the risk at 0 or 0.1 at most.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical error handling module with no security issues. The reported scores are consistent with the analysis.",
