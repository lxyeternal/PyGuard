{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the notion-sdk-py library, including HTTP errors, timeout errors, and API-specific error codes.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (enum, typing), external library (httpx), and class definitions with methods.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and handling, especially within HTTPResponseError and APIResponseError classes.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised with messages and response data; no flow of untrusted data outside exception handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior observed; code follows typical patterns for error handling and enum definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions with no input or output data processing beyond exception initialization. It uses httpx to handle HTTP response objects and defines API error codes using Enum. No untrusted data input or unsafe operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code's structure and content are consistent with normal error handling implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for a Python API client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious anomalies. The design is standard and safe for its intended purpose.",
