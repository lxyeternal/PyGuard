{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and error codes for handling API response errors in the notion-sdk-py library.",
  "sources": "HTTP responses received via httpx.Response, specifically response.status_code, response.headers, response.text",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the storage of response details (headers, body) in exceptions could leak sensitive info if mishandled, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are present",
  "flows": "HTTP response is passed to exception constructors, which store status, headers, and body; no external data flows or network activity beyond exception handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard for error handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for request timeouts and HTTP response errors, along with an enum for API error codes and a utility function to validate error codes. It uses 'httpx' for response handling, storing response details in exceptions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The code is clean, well-structured, and serves its purpose without security issues. The potential minor risk involves response data leakage if exceptions are mishandled, but this is typical in error handling modules and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure error handling module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores from the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
