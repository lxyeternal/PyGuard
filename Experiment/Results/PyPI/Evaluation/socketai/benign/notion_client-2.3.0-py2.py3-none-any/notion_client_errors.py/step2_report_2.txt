  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code correctness, potential security issues, malicious behavior, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines exception classes and error codes for API error handling. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Valid and accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the safe handling of HTTP responses and error codes. No malicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95 — the slight security risk might reflect the fact that error details (headers, body) are stored, which could potentially leak sensitive info if exceptions are mishandled. But in the context, this is standard.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. No malicious intent or malware.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious or malicious code, just exception definitions and validation functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard exception classes, no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard error handling classes, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (0).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected (0).\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as these are standard error handling classes, with minor potential info leak considerations in securityRisk=0.1, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely for error handling, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward and standard.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential info leakage in error details, but this is standard in error handling modules)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and the scores appropriate. No further action needed.",
