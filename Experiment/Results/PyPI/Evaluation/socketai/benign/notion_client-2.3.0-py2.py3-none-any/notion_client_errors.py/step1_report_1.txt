  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and error codes for handling API errors in notion-sdk-py.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, exception initializations, enum members, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; code primarily defines exceptions and utility functions without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for HTTP and API errors, with clear messaging and proper use of inheritance. It defines API error codes as an enum, and a utility to check error code validity. No signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The classes and functions are straightforward, focusing solely on error handling. No suspicious side-effects or external interactions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling module for an SDK, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs structured error representation and validation without any security risks.",
