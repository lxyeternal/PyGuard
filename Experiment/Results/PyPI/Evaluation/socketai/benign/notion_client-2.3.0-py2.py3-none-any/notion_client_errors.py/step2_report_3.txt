  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard error handling module for an SDK, defining custom exceptions, error codes, and a utility function.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code relies on the 'httpx' library for HTTP response handling, which is standard.\n- The exception classes and enum definitions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration.\n- The security risk scores are low (around 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All expected classes, enums, and functions are present and correctly implemented.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about untrusted input beyond normal error handling; no insecure patterns are evident.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores given (malware=0, securityRisk≈0.1) seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The code is purely for error handling; it does not perform any network operations, data processing beyond storing response details, or external interactions.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n- The utility function `is_api_error_code` is a simple membership check, standard in such modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly because of potential information leakage if exceptions are not handled properly by the user, but not inherent in the code itself)\n\n**Note:** The code is safe, standard, and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; the scores are appropriate.\n- Continue monitoring for any external dependencies or usage patterns that might introduce vulnerabilities, but based solely on this code, the security posture is sound.\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the provided reports: the code is a typical, secure error handling module with no malicious intent. The scores reflect its benign nature accurately.",
