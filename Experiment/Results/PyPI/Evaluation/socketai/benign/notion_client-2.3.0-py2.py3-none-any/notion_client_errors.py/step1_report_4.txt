{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors in the notion-sdk-py, including HTTP and API-specific errors.",
  "sources": "Imports httpx for handling HTTP responses and exceptions; no external input sources are directly read; class attributes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and message construction, primarily for debugging and error reporting; no untrusted data sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "HTTP responses are passed into exception constructors, which extract status codes, headers, and body text for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code strictly defines exception classes with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly defines custom exceptions for HTTP and API errors, utilizing the httpx library for response handling. It includes an enumeration for API error codes and a utility function to validate error codes. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious payloads. The exception classes are standard and only store response data and error messages. All elements serve error handling purposes with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for an API client. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage. It performs straightforward exception definition and utility functions with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
