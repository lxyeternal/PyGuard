  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes and an enum for API error codes, along with a utility function.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and serves error handling purposes.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are noted.\n- The code relies on the 'httpx' library but uses it in a typical manner.\n- The attributes and functions are purely for error representation and validation, with no external data leaks or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware score = 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign obfuscated = 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, justified by the code's nature.\n- **Functionality:** The code only defines exceptions and a utility function; no data flow or external side-effects are present.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Correctly identifies that the code is purely for error handling, with no malicious intent.  \n- The confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Also correctly states that the code is standard and safe.  \n- The security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, considering the code could leak response details if exceptions are mishandled, but this is a typical risk in error handling code, not malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Consistent with others, emphasizing the lack of suspicious patterns.  \n- The risk score is again 0.1, justified as minimal.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Correctly notes the standard nature of the code.  \n- No anomalies or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Confirms the straightforward, safe design.  \n- Security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code).  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical error handling risk).\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely for error handling and validation, the scores should reflect that. The small security risk is due to potential information leakage if exceptions are not handled properly elsewhere, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**            | **0.1**  |\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- The current scores are appropriate.  \n- No changes needed.  \n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for an SDK, with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain as is.",
