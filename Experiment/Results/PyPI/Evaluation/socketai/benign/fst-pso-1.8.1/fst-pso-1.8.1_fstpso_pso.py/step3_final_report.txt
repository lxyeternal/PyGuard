  "purpose": "Standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) implementation for optimization tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from boundaries, initial guesses, and user-defined fitness functions; uses environment variables, random modules, and file I/O for logging; imports subprocess (unused).",
  "sinks": "Writes best fitness and solution data to files; potential subprocess calls if later used.",
  "flows": "Particle initialization, fitness evaluation, position and velocity updates, logging, and potential external process execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; subprocess module imported but not used; no suspicious external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward PSO implementation with no signs of malicious behavior. It uses standard modules and practices, with no network activity or malicious payloads. The unused subprocess import is benign but could be exploited if later utilized maliciously. File I/O and randomness are used as intended for optimization routines. User-defined fitness functions pose a potential risk if supplied from untrusted sources, but this is inherent to such systems and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign PSO implementation with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects the minimal inherent risks associated with file I/O and external input reliance, but no malicious behavior is present.",
