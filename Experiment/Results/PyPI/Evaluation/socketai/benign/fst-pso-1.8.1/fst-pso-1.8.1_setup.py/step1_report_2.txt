{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'fst-pso'.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file 'README.txt' using open() to provide a long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security or leaks data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.txt' into the long_description parameter in setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a file for the long_description is standard; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses distutils to set up a Python package with metadata. It reads the 'README.txt' file to include the long description, which is typical for Python packaging. There are no indications of input from untrusted sources or any data flow leading to malicious actions. No code executes external commands, connects to networks, or manipulates data in suspicious ways. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical packaging tasks with no anomalies or malicious behaviors.",
