{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'fst-pso', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'README.txt' to populate 'long_description'. It also sources package information and dependencies from static definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if the 'README.txt' contains sensitive information, but this is standard and intended. No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Static data sources (metadata, dependencies, file content) are used solely for package setup without any flow of untrusted input to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code uses typical setup patterns. No suspicious URL or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using 'distutils.core'. It reads the 'README.txt' for the long description, which is common practice. The dependencies are statically defined. No dynamic or untrusted input processing, no network activity, and no malicious patterns detected. The use of 'open' for reading the description is typical, with proper encoding specified. The URL points to a GitHub repository, which appears legitimate based on provided info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It follows standard practices and does not contain anomalies or malicious behaviors.",
