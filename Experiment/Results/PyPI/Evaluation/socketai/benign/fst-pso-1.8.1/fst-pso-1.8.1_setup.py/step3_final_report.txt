  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.txt' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Static data from local files; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious; no exception handling on open() but common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package configuration script with no dynamic code, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It reads local files and defines metadata and dependencies. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious. The lack of exception handling on file open is typical in such scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
