{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'fst-pso', intended to configure and install the package with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The only data source is the 'README.txt' file read with open('README.txt', encoding='utf-8').",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.txt' into the 'long_description' parameter in the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; the code follows standard setup script conventions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core.setup' to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a local README.txt file for the long description, which is standard practice. The package information includes author, email, URL, classifiers, and dependencies ('numpy' and 'miniful'). The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or hidden behaviors. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this setup script. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
