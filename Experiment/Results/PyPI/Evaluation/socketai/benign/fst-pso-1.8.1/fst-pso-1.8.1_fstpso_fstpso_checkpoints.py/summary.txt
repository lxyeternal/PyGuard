  "conclusion": "The code is a standard checkpoint utility with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the use of pickle, which can be exploited if the pickle file is later loaded from untrusted sources. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of 0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) accurately reflect the code's behavior and risks."
