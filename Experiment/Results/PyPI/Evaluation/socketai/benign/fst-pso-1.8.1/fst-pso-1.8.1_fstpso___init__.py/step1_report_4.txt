{
  "purpose": "Importing the class FuzzyPSO from the module fstpso, likely for use in a larger program involving fuzzy particle swarm optimization.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the fstpso module, specifically the FuzzyPSO class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified, as there is no data processing or untrusted input handling shown.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; this is just an import statement with no runtime data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing FuzzyPSO from a relative module fstpso. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. As an isolated line, it cannot perform any malicious activity. It is a common pattern in Python projects to import specific classes or functions from local modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or anomalies. Given only this line, the security risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
