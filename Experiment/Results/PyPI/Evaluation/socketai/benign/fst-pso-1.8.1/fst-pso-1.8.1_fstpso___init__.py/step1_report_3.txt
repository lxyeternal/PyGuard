{
  "purpose": "The code imports the FuzzyPSO class from the fstpso module, likely for use in fuzzy particle swarm optimization algorithms.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.fstpso'",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import statement only; no data flow or source-to-sink paths within this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed in this minimal code snippet",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a standard import from a local module, which is common in Python projects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The minimal nature of the code makes it unlikely to contain malicious intent. No external inputs, outputs, or side effects are present here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement importing a class from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
