  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same minimal code snippet: `from .fstpso import FuzzyPSO`.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that this is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n- The code snippet is straightforward: a local import of a class `FuzzyPSO` from a module `fstpso`.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Reports:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code is simply an import statement; there are no issues or malicious indicators.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this import statement.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All malware and security risk scores are zero, which aligns with the analysis.  \n  The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty about benignity.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity. The malware score of zero is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only analyze the provided snippet.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the evidence, the code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical import statement with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. Without additional context or code, there is no reason to assign any risk or malware scores above zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
