  "purpose": "Import the FuzzyPSO class from a local module named fstpso.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'fstpso' from the local package and imports 'FuzzyPSO'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class from a local module; no data flow or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be a standard import statement with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a class from a relative module, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data handling, network communication, or suspicious constructs. Given its minimal nature, it is unlikely to be malicious. The only potential concern could be the contents of 'fstpso', but based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. The code is benign.",
