{
  "purpose": "This code imports the class FuzzyPSO from a local module fstpso, likely for use in a larger application or algorithm.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the module fstpso, which is part of the package or project directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing the class FuzzyPSO from fstpso; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, typical in Python projects. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or insecure operations. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with high confidence levels. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external communications are evident. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. Since the snippet is purely an import, the security implications depend on the contents of the fstpso module, which are outside the scope of this code review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriate, with scores reflecting the safe nature of this minimal code. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
