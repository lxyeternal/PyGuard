  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .fstpso import FuzzyPSO`.\n- The reports consistently conclude that this is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- Obfuscated and security risk scores are also zero, which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The import statement is present and correctly formatted.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence or suspicion of malicious activity based solely on this import statement.\n- **Anomalies or obfuscation:** None are present; the code is straightforward.\n- **Data flows or sinks:** None are evident here.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify that this line alone is unlikely to be malicious.\n- No report suggests any suspicious patterns or external behaviors tied to this snippet.\n- Since the reports are consistent and accurate, no changes are necessary regarding their conclusions.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; this import alone does not pose a security risk.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- While the import itself is benign, the security implications depend on the contents of the `fstpso` module.\n- If the module `fstpso` contains malicious code, that would be outside the scope of this import statement.\n- The reports do not mention any suspicion about the module's contents, only the import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the provided code snippet and reports, I concur with the assessments that:\n- The code is benign.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident here.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the minimal and safe nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe import statement is standard, safe, and poses no security concerns based solely on this code. Further analysis of the `fstpso` module would be needed to assess any potential risks from its contents, but the snippet itself is not suspicious.",
