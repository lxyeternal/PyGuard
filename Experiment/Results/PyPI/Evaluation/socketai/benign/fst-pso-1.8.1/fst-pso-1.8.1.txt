The minor issues are related to code quality and legacy syntax, not security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by minor code issues. Overall, the code is safe for use."

The security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects the minimal inherent risks associated with file I/O and external input reliance, but no malicious behavior is present."

The main security concern is the use of pickle, which can be exploited if the pickle file is later loaded from untrusted sources. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of 0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) accurately reflect the code's behavior and risks."
