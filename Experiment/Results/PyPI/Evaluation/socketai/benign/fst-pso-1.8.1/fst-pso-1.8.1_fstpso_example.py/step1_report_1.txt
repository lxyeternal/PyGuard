{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and run a fuzzy particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to minimize a simple quadratic fitness function over a 10-dimensional search space.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'fstpso' library import, and the 'example_fitness' function which takes a particle as input. The main block does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs results via print statements, which do not pose a security risk. No untrusted data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "The main flow is: initialize PSO object -> set search space -> set fitness function -> run optimization -> print results. Data flows internally within the library during optimization, but no external or malicious data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions and clear variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially custom or third-party library 'fstpso', defines a simple fitness function that sums squares of particles, and runs an optimization with specified parameters. It then prints the optimized solution and its fitness. No malicious or suspicious code constructs are present. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulation, or access sensitive data. The usage appears typical for a numerical optimization task.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a particle swarm optimization example. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a standard, straightforward application of an optimization library.",
