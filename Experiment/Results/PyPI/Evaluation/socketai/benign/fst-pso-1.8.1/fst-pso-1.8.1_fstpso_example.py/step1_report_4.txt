{
  "purpose": "The code implements an optimization using the FuzzyPSO library to minimize a simple quadratic fitness function.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters from the set_search_space method and the max_iter argument; it also uses the example_fitness function for evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Results are printed to the console; no data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (search space, max iterations) flow into the FP object methods; fitness function provides data for optimization; results flow to print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses a standard optimization pattern. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially external or third-party library 'fstpso' and creates an instance of FuzzyPSO. It defines a simple quadratic fitness function. The script sets the search space and fitness function, then calls the solver method with a max iteration limit. Results are printed to the console. No suspicious data flow, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code performs a straightforward optimization task with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic implementation of an optimization routine using the FuzzyPSO library. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided code. The use of third-party library 'fstpso' should be verified for integrity separately, but the code itself is benign.",
