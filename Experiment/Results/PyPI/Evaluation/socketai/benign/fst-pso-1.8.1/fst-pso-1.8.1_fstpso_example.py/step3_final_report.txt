{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple particle swarm optimization using the 'fstpso' library to minimize a quadratic function over a 10-dimensional space.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data; it defines a fitness function and sets search space parameters internally.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs results via print statements; no external data or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "The fitness function is used as input to the optimizer; the optimizer's output is printed; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, correctly implements a standard optimization routine, and relies on an external library 'fstpso' assumed to be benign. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or obfuscation are present. The dependency trustworthiness is outside the scope but should be verified separately. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on an external library whose integrity should be verified separately. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
