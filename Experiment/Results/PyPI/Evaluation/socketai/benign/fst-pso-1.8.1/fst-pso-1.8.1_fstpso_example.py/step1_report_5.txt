{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization (FuzzyPSO) process to minimize a simple quadratic fitness function over a specified search space.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data or input; it solely defines an internal fitness function and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations. It outputs results to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the definition of the fitness function through the FuzzyPSO optimization process to the printed output. No external data influences the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The usage of the 'fstpso' library appears straightforward. No obfuscation, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a likely third-party library 'fstpso' and defines a simple fitness function calculating the sum of squares. It sets a 10-dimensional search space from -10 to 10 for each dimension. The optimization process is invoked with a maximum of 100 iterations. The code then prints the best solution and its fitness. The structure and logic are typical for an optimization task and do not show signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The library usage is standard, and no external input handling or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a fuzzy PSO optimization routine, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
