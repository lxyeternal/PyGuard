{
  "purpose": "Standard fuzzy logic rule processing and Sugeno inference implementation; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Input data read from fuzzy operator objects, rule definitions, and variable configurations within the fuzzySystem object.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or file operations; data flows internally within the fuzzy system computations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fuzzySystem.fuzzify() through process_operators() to compute memberships, then to return_all_output_variable_names() and actual_sugeno_inference() for output calculation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'warnings.warn' without importing 'warnings' module, which would cause runtime errors but not security issues; uses Python 2 print syntax, indicating legacy code but not obfuscation; unused import 'fuzzy.storage.fcl.Reader'.",
  "analysis": "The code implements fuzzy logic processing with functions for handling operators, computing singleton values, and performing Sugeno inference. No external network or file operations are present. The only anomalies are minor: missing 'warnings' import and legacy Python 2 syntax. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The code is straightforward and relies solely on the 'fuzzy' library, which is open-source. The minor issues do not impact security but suggest areas for code modernization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of fuzzy logic and Sugeno inference with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The minor issues are related to code quality and legacy syntax, not security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by minor code issues. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
