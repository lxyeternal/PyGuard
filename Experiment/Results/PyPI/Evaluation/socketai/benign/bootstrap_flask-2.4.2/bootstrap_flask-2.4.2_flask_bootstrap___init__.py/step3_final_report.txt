{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Flask extension for managing Bootstrap resources, including CSS and JS files, with configuration-driven URL generation and integrity attributes.",
  "sources": "Configuration variables, static asset filenames, and app object during initialization.",
  "sinks": "HTML link and script tags generated for resource inclusion, with integrity attributes and URLs based on configuration.",
  "flows": "Resource URLs are constructed from configuration or static paths; no untrusted user input influences these URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code follows standard Flask extension patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code loads static resources for Bootstrap and related libraries, using configuration and static filenames. No user input or untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to code injection or data leakage. Integrity attributes are statically set or configured, not dynamically manipulated based on untrusted sources. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The resource URLs are generated safely, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured Flask extension for resource management with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the static and configuration-based nature of resource loading.",
