{
  "purpose": "This code is a Flask extension for integrating Bootstrap (versions 4 and 5) into Flask applications, providing utilities for loading CSS/JS resources, initializing extensions, and defining custom form fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values from 'current_app.config' and application data during initialization, as well as static asset URLs via 'url_for'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage of 'url_for' with static filenames, and string concatenation for resource URLs and HTML tags, which could be exploited if inputs are tampered with. No user input directly influences these URLs in this code.",
  "flows": "Configuration settings and static filenames are read and used to generate HTML tags for CSS and JS resources, but there are no untrusted data flows from external sources into critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code primarily initializes extensions and generates resource URLs. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides Flask extension classes for Bootstrap 4 and 5, managing static resource loading and app configuration. It uses safe practices such as 'url_for' for local assets and string formatting for URLs. There are no operations involving untrusted user inputs, nor are there any network connections, data leaks, or system modifications. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard, well-structured Flask extension for Bootstrap integration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The code is focused on resource management and extension initialization with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
