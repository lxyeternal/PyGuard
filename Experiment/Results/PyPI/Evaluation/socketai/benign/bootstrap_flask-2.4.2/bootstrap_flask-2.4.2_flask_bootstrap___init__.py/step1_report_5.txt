{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Flask extension for integrating Bootstrap (versions 4 and 5) with additional utility functions for rendering resources and managing configurations, along with a custom form field.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings (app.config), static resource URLs via url_for, input parameters for load_css and load_js methods, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Rendered HTML strings with resource URLs, runtime configuration values, and potential injection points through user-supplied data in methods like load_css and load_js.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters and method arguments determine resource URLs and integrity attributes; these are then incorporated into HTML link/script tags, which are rendered and potentially included in templates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code observed. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variables present. Use of warnings.warn with static strings is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Flask extension that manages loading Bootstrap and related libraries, setting default configurations, and defining utility functions for template rendering. The static and CDN URLs are configurable, with integrity checks for security. No external or untrusted data sources, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code are present. The code structure appears straightforward and purpose-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Flask extension for Bootstrap integration, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely manages resource loading, defaults, and configurations. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected.",
