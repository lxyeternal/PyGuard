{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes and functions for integrating Bootstrap (versions 4 and 5) into a Flask web application, including resource loading and extension initialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration variables from Flask's current_app.config, such as BOOTSTRAP_SERVE_LOCAL, BOOTSTRAP_BOOTSWATCH_THEME, and version strings; it also reads the app object during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code generates HTML markup for CSS and JS resource links, including integrity attributes for SRI. No user input is directly used in these sink locations.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables influence resource URLs, which are then embedded into HTML markup for inclusion in web pages. There is no untrusted data flow from user input to resource loading.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code uses standard Flask and Jinja2 features, with no dynamic execution or obfuscation present. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a structured way to load CSS and JS resources from CDN or local static folders, based on app configuration. It initializes Flask extensions, registers blueprints, and exposes global template functions. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling. The integrity attributes are set via class attributes and configuration, with no dynamic or external input influencing them. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Flask extension setup for Bootstrap integration, with resource loading based on configuration settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is well-structured, and no suspicious anomalies are observed.",
