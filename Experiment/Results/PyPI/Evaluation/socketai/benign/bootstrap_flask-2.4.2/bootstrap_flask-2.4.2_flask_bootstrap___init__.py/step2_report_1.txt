  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical soundness, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines classes/functions for Bootstrap integration, reading configuration variables, and initializing Flask extensions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates HTML for CSS/JS links with integrity attributes, no user input directly influences these.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It’s a standard resource loader and extension setup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that there’s no malicious activity, malware, or security risk is accurate. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar extension for Bootstrap, reading configuration and static URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially unsafe usage of 'url_for' and string concatenation, but no untrusted data flow is evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The report correctly identifies resource URL generation as safe.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, and the security risk is minimal (0.2). The confidence of 0.9 is reasonable given the code’s straightforward nature.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (reasonable, given the potential for misconfiguration but no direct threat)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, resource loading based on configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTML tags generated with resource URLs, no untrusted input used.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, and the low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate. Confidence of 0.9 matches the assessment.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar resource management, configuration-driven.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTML resource tags generated securely, no untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No security issues, scores are appropriate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, managing Bootstrap resources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Resource URLs and integrity attributes are set via configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hidden code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Estimation:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a standard Flask extension for resource loading and app configuration. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a straightforward resource loader and Flask extension initializer. It uses standard Flask practices, configuration, and template globals. No untrusted input is processed in a way that could lead to code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Integrity attributes are statically defined or configured, not dynamically manipulated based on untrusted data.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores should be **all zero** across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
