  "purpose": "This code provides a Flask extension for integrating Bootstrap 4 and 5 with support for CDN or local assets, including helper functions for templates and app configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from current_app.config, uses url_for to generate static asset URLs, and imports user inputs via Flask request context (though not explicitly shown in this code).",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML markup strings for CSS and JS resource links, which could be manipulated if input values are insecure or manipulated, but no direct untrusted data flows are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Configuration values (version, theme) influence URL generation for assets. The load_css and load_js functions generate HTML link/script tags based on these settings, but no untrusted data is directly used in a way that leads to dangerous actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual logic. The code mainly involves static URL generation and template globals setup. No malicious backdoors or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask extension for Bootstrap integration, setting global variables, loading assets via CDN or locally, and configuring app settings. It carefully handles resource URL construction and security attributes (integrity, crossorigin). No input processing or external data manipulation that could be exploited for malicious purposes is present. It primarily facilitates frontend resource inclusion and app configuration without handling sensitive data or executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured Flask extension for Bootstrap integration, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It relies on standard Flask practices and static URL generation. No malicious intent or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
