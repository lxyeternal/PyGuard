{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a testing framework related to notebook handling and execution.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or data; class definitions are static and do not process external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; exception classes are for error handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The __test__ attributes are set to False, indicating these classes are likely intended for testing purposes, but this is standard for test framework code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exception classes. It includes custom exception subclasses for specific error cases in a notebook execution context. No input/output processing, network activity, or external data handling is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are detected. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions intended for error handling in a larger framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes for error handling in a notebook testing framework. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is safe and straightforward.",
