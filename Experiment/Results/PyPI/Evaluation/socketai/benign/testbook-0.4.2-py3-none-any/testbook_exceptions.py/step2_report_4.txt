  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data input, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n- The use of `__test__ = False` is standard in pytest to exclude classes from test collection.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are evident.\n- The `TestbookRuntimeError` class has a constructor storing traceback and error class, with overridden `__str__` and `__repr__` methods, which is standard practice for custom exceptions with additional info.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The code matches the description and contains only class definitions with no suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears correct and well-structured.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk)?**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  Correct. No obfuscation present.\n\n- **Risk score (0):**  \n  Correct. The code is benign, with no security risk.\n\n- **Use of `__test__ = False`:**  \n  Standard in test code, not suspicious.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The code does not process untrusted input, does not perform external operations, and contains no dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is a typical set of custom exception classes for error handling in a testing or notebook environment.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign, straightforward, and typical for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo further action required. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
