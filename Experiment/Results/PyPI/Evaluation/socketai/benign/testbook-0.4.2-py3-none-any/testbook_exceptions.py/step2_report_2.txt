  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n   - No external data input, network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code.\n   - The `__test__` attribute is used by testing frameworks like pytest to control test collection, which is standard practice.\n   - The `TestbookRuntimeError` class includes a constructor that stores an error value, traceback, and optional error class, and overrides `__str__` and `__repr__` for custom string representation.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports consistently identify the code as straightforward, with no suspicious activity, which is accurate.\n   - They correctly note that the `__test__` attribute is used in testing frameworks and is not malicious.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely definitional with no dynamic or external interactions.\n   - No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their assessments on observable facts: class definitions, no external data, no obfuscation.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\nThe code is a set of straightforward, well-structured exception class definitions intended for error handling in a testing or notebook environment. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of `__test__` is standard in testing frameworks and does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
