{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a testing or notebook environment, including error types and specialized errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and methods without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions. The classes mainly serve as error types and include a specialized constructor in TestbookRuntimeError that stores traceback and error class information. There are no data input sources, no external communications, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation present. The purpose appears to be structured error handling within a larger application, likely related to notebook or testing environments. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a structured error handling module, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
