  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a testing or notebook environment",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading points present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of class definitions with no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or file I/O. The classes do not execute any code upon import, nor do they contain dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. The __test__ attribute is set to False for some classes, which is typical in pytest to exclude from test collection, not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward, purpose-built for error handling in a testing framework, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign component of a larger testing or notebook management system.",
