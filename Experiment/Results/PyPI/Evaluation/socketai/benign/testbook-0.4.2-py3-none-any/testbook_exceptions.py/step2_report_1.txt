  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The provided code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n- Some classes set `__test__ = False`, which is a common pattern to exclude classes from pytest collection.\n- The `TestbookRuntimeError` class overrides `__init__`, storing additional info like traceback and error class, and customizes string representations.\n- There are no external data inputs, network calls, file operations, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate for error handling within a testing or notebook environment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward class definitions with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. No issues are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the purpose and structure of the code, noting the absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Since all reports and the code itself indicate no malicious intent or security risk, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All claims are based on factual analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall verdict:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a testing or notebook system. There are no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to scores are necessary.",
