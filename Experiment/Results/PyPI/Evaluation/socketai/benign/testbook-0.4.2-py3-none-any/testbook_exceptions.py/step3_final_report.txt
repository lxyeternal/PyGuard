  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a testing or notebook environment.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute assignments within the code.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation and raising exceptions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __test__ = False to exclude classes from test collection; storing traceback info in a class attribute.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with some setting __test__ = False. The TestbookRuntimeError class stores traceback and error class info, with overridden __str__ and __repr__. No external data, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be boilerplate for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The use of __test__ is standard in testing frameworks and does not indicate malicious behavior. The traceback attribute is stored but not executed or transmitted, posing no security risk. Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a testing or notebook system. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
