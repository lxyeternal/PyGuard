  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in a testing or notebook environment.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions do not process input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__test__' attribute to possibly influence testing frameworks; no other unusual or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exceptions. It includes constructor overrides and string representation methods. There are no external data inputs, network calls, file operations, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious logic, and no indication of malicious behavior. The '__test__' attribute is used by some testing frameworks to control test collection but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions intended for error handling in a testing or notebook system. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
