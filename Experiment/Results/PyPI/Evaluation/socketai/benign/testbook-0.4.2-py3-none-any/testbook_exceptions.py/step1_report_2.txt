  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a testing or notebook management system",
  "sources": "Class definitions, constructor, and string representation methods",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data or untrusted input is processed or outputted in a way that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are static definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from standard exceptions. Some classes set __test__ = False to prevent pytest collection, which is normal. The TestbookRuntimeError class has an __init__ method storing an error value, traceback, and optional error class, and overrides __str__ and __repr__ for custom string representations. There is no code execution, data input, network communication, or other suspicious activity. The code appears to be straightforward, intended for error handling in a testing or notebook context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, or security issues. It is typical boilerplate code for handling specific errors.",
