  "purpose": "Define a subclass of NotebookNode to add assertion and data extraction methods for notebook outputs.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; relies on existing NotebookNode outputs.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data directly; methods access output data properties.",
  "flows": "Method output_text concatenates 'text' from outputs; execute_result collects 'data' from 'execute_result' outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a NotebookNode class, adding properties to extract output text and execution result data from notebook outputs. No input/output sanitization or network operations are present. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors identified. The methods merely process existing output data structures without performing dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward extension for extracting output data from notebook nodes, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
