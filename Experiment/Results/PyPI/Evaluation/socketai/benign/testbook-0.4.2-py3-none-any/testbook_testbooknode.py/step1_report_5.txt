  "purpose": "Extend the NotebookNode class to perform assertions and provide additional properties for extracting output text and execution results from notebook cells.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'outputs' attribute of the NotebookNode instance, specifically reading 'text' and 'data' fields within outputs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially return untrusted output data in output_text and execute_result properties, but no data is sent or stored elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input 'outputs' data -> output_text property retrieves 'text' fields -> execute_result property retrieves 'data' fields from 'execute_result' output types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code performs straightforward data extraction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of NotebookNode with two properties. output_text concatenates 'text' fields from each output if present, and execute_result extracts 'data' from outputs of type 'execute_result'. Both methods operate on the 'outputs' attribute, assuming it's a list of dictionaries. The code does not perform any external calls, network operations, or malicious activities. It mainly processes data in a read-only manner, with no apparent malicious intent or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple extension of a data structure to extract specific information from notebook outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this fragment.",
