{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass `TestbookNode` extending `NotebookNode` with additional assertion methods and properties to extract output text and execution results from notebook outputs.",
  "sources": "Imports from `nbformat` and access to the `outputs` attribute of `NotebookNode` objects.",
  "sinks": "The code accesses the `outputs` attribute and retrieves data, but does not execute or pass untrusted data to external systems or perform any network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the `outputs` attribute through the `output_text` and `execute_result` properties, which process and return specific data parts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and primarily data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external library and defines a subclass with additional properties for data extraction. The methods iterate over `outputs` and collect specific fields (`text` and `data`). There are no external calls, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. The class appears to serve as a utility for extracting information from notebook output nodes. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is well-structured and follows standard Python patterns without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of `NotebookNode` designed for extracting output text and execution results from notebook outputs. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks and appears to be a standard utility class for processing notebook data.",
