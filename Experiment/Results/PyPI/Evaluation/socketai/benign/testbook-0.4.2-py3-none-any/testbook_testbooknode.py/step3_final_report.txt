  "purpose": "Utility extension for extracting output text and execution results from notebook nodes",
  "sources": "self['outputs'] list within the NotebookNode object",
  "sinks": "None; data is only read and returned, no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "Accessing self['outputs'] -> Filtering by 'output_type' -> Returning 'text' or 'data' fields",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data access and concatenation, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of NotebookNode with two properties: output_text concatenates all 'text' entries in outputs; execute_result extracts 'data' from outputs of type 'execute_result'. It performs simple iteration over a list of dictionaries, with no external input, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The logic is safe, clear, and intended for data extraction. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign utility class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for extracting output data from notebook nodes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
