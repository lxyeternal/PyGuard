  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for extracting output data from notebook nodes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature."
