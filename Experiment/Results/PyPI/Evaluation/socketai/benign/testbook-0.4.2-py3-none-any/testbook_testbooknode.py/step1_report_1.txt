  "purpose": "Extend NotebookNode class to add assertion methods for output text and execution results in Jupyter Notebook cells.",
  "sources": "Imports nbformat's NotebookNode; accesses self['outputs'] to read output data.",
  "sinks": "Returns concatenated text from outputs; accesses self['outputs'] for execute_result property.",
  "flows": "Reads self['outputs']' data to generate output_text and execute_result properties.",
  "anomalies": "Uses property decorators; straightforward data access; no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of NotebookNode to facilitate assertions. It adds two properties: output_text, which concatenates all 'text' entries from outputs; and execute_result, which extracts 'data' from outputs of type 'execute_result'. The implementation uses simple iteration and data retrieval with no external input handling or dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code is clean, straightforward, and focused on data access and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility extension for notebook nodes to access output data conveniently. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code is well-structured, transparent, and safe.",
