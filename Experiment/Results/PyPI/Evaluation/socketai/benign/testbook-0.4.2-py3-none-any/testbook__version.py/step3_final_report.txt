  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to a variable, typically used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal assignment of a string to a variable named 'version'. It involves no input/output, data flow, or external interactions. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is typical for defining a version string in a package or module. All prior reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring aligns with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, representing a standard version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
