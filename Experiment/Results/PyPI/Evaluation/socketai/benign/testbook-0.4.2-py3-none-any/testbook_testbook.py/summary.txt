  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for testing Jupyter notebooks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is executing untrusted notebooks, which is outside the scope of the code's intent but relevant operationally. Scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a slight risk score of 0.2 reflecting the potential danger of executing untrusted code."
