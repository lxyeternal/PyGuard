{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a local module and a test utility, serving to manage versioning and testing functionalities within the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal modules: ._version and .testbook.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "The source data (imported modules) is used internally; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from internal modules, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity. The code is clear, minimal, and typical for Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements are standard for version management and testing utilities in Python packages. All signals and reports correctly reflect this benign assessment.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
