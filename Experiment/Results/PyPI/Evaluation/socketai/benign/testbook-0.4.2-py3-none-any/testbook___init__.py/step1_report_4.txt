{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and a testing utility from internal modules, likely for version tracking and testing purposes within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._version and .testbook",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static references",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, which is common in package setup or initialization files. It does not execute any logic, process input, or interact with external data sources. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The minimal nature and use of relative imports are standard in modular Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a setup or configuration file to include version info and testing utilities. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
