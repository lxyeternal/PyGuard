  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from external sources to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed; simple imports with no dynamic execution or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules. It assigns the version string to __version__ and imports a module named testbook.
