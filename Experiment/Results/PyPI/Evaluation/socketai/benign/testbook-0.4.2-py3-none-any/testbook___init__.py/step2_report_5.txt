  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules (. _version and .testbook).\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is reported.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are observed.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero or near-zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets are straightforward: `from ._version import version as __version__` and `from .testbook import testbook`.\n- These are typical in Python packages for versioning and testing purposes.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The confidence levels are high, and the conclusions are justified based on the code's simplicity.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The slight variation in confidence and risk scores (e.g., 0.9, 1.0, 0.1) is acceptable considering the minimal information.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only performs static imports from internal modules, there's no basis for assigning a higher risk score.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n- The obfuscation score is 0, as no obfuscation techniques are used.\n- The overall security risk is minimal, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All claims are based on observable code behavior, which is benign.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the assessments are justified.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores align well with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign import statement for versioning and testing utilities, with no security risks or malware present. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Confirm that all scores are set to 0 for malware and obfuscated.\n- Keep the security risk at 0.\n- Maintain high confidence levels.\n\nThis is a typical, safe pattern in open-source packages.",
