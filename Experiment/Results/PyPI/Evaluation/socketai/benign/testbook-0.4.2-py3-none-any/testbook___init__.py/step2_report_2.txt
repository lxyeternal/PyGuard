  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules (. _version and .testbook).\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is reported.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is minimal and typical for package setup or testing purposes.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**1. Report 1**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues found.\n- **Score assessment:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard import statements.\n\n**2. Report 2**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**3. Report 3**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**4. Report 4**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk score (0.1), but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable given the minimal uncertainty.\n- **Conclusion:** Still benign, just cautious.\n\n**5. Report 5**\n- Fully confident (1.0), no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** All zero or near-zero, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, as there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk:** 0, since the code is simple and does not introduce any security risk.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, safe snippet for internal module imports, with no malicious or security concerns.",
