{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and a testbook module, likely for version tracking and testing purposes within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._version and .testbook, which are internal modules or packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements, importing version info and a test module. These are standard import practices for package versioning and testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package.\n\nSince the code only imports modules without executing or processing untrusted input, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious activities evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. It simply imports internal modules for versioning and testing purposes.",
