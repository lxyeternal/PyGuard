  "purpose": "Generate random variable names for testing purposes and recursively find subclasses of a given class.",
  "sources": "random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) in random_varname function; klass.__subclasses__() in all_subclasses function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if external input influences 'klass' or 'length', but none are explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "random_varname generates a string from random choices; all_subclasses yields subclass types through recursion.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; functions perform standard operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for generating random strings and retrieving class subclasses recursively. It relies on standard Python library functions and does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations. No input/output streams, external data, or security-sensitive operations are present. The functions are straightforward and serve debugging or class inspection purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for generating random variable names and inspecting class hierarchies. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
