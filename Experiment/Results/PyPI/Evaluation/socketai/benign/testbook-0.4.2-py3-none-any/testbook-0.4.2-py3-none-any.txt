      "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but involves dynamic code execution points that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score ranges from 0.4 to 0.75 depending on the context and input trustworthiness. Proper input validation and sanitization are essential to mitigate injection risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a potent testing utility that allows for flexible manipulation of notebook cells and kernel state. While it does not contain malicious code or obfuscation, its design inherently permits malicious use if misused with untrusted inputs. Proper safeguards, such as input validation and sandboxing, are essential to mitigate security risks."

The primary security concern is executing untrusted notebooks, which is outside the scope of the code's intent but relevant operationally. Scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a slight risk score of 0.2 reflecting the potential danger of executing untrusted code."
