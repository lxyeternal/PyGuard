  "purpose": "Load a specific JSII assembly for aws-lambda-python and publish the package metadata.",
  "sources": "Assembly load via jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() and the import statements for modules.",
  "sinks": "Assembly loading operation; no untrusted data or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> assembly load -> publication.publish()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup for an AWS CDK Python package, involving module imports, loading a versioned assembly archive, and publishing metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The assembly load is from a trusted source, and the code structure is straightforward and clear. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical for AWS CDK package setup, with no malicious intent or security issues. The low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate given the assembly load, but overall, the code poses minimal risk.",
