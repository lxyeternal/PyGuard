  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines classes for AWS Lambda and layers, focusing on configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data processing, no external data flows, no network or file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code is declarative.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely infrastructural, configuration classes for AWS CDK. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully legitimate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—configuration for Lambda functions and layers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows or system calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or malicious code; standard SDK-like code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Infrastructure code, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; purely SDK/configuration code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuring Lambda functions and layers, including bundling options.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct system or network operations; potential sinks are property assignments affecting deployment.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; examples include configuring private repositories, which could be misused if credentials are embedded, but these are just illustrative.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard infrastructure code; potential misuse depends on user input, but no malicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No malware; potential risk if user supplies malicious build args, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above—configuring Lambda functions/layers with build args and environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potential for untrusted data in build args/env vars to influence build or runtime, but no active malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or backdoors; examples are illustrative.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Infrastructure code, with potential misuse if supplied with malicious parameters, but no embedded malware.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.0 (malware), but security risk is noted as 0.2 due to possible misuse.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware, but caution advised if untrusted input is used.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuration classes for AWS Lambda, including bundling options.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data exfiltration or runtime code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or malicious logic; standard SDK-like code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Infrastructure configuration only, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Legitimate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malware (score 0). The code is purely declarative, class definitions, and configuration schemas.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all cases; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting potential misuse if user supplies malicious parameters, but no embedded malicious code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard SDK/library for AWS CDK constructs for Python Lambda functions and layers.\n- No runtime code, no network connections, no data exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- Potential security concerns are related to how users supply parameters like build args or environment variables, which could be exploited if malicious data is provided, but this is outside the code's scope and not intrinsic to the code itself.\n- The detailed documentation and examples are typical for SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly theoretical if user supplies malicious input)\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is legitimate, purely infrastructural, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The potential security risk is very low and depends on external input, not on the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured library for AWS Lambda/CDK configuration with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The risk is negligible, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
