{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and data structures for configuring AWS Lambda functions and layers within the AWS CDK framework, primarily focusing on deployment parameters, bundling options, and resource properties.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and property definitions that accept configuration parameters such as 'entry', 'bundling', 'environment', 'build_args', etc.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data flows, external calls, or data exfiltration; purely declarative configuration objects.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow into resource definitions but do not involve runtime data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The code is SDK-like, intended for infrastructure setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for AWS Lambda functions and layers, including options for bundling, environment variables, and resource properties. There are no embedded runtime operations, external system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The presence of parameters like 'build_args' and 'environment' could be misused if supplied with malicious inputs, but these are standard configuration options. No secrets or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and aligns with typical SDK or IaC patterns. No obfuscation or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate infrastructure configuration code for AWS Lambda functions and layers, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent. The low risk scores reflect potential misuse if untrusted input is provided, but the code itself is safe and standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal (~0.1).",
