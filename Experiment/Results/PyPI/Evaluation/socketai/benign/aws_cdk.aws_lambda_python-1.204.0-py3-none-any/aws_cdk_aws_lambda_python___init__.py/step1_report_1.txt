{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and data structures for creating and configuring Python-based AWS Lambda functions and layers using AWS CDK, including options for bundling dependencies and customizing deployment.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration parameters, class initializers, and property definitions for Lambda functions, layers, and bundling options.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external data transmissions are present; the code only sets up configuration objects and class definitions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows or untrusted data handling; primarily class and data structure definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code contains only type definitions, property setters, and class constructors. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured classes for configuring AWS Lambda functions and layers, including options for bundling dependencies with custom build arguments. There are no runtime operations, data handling, or network connections, and no indication of malicious intent. All class methods are constructors or property accessors, with no runtime logic or external interactions. The purpose is to facilitate infrastructure-as-code deployment, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely infrastructural and declarative, intended for setting up AWS Lambda functions using CDK. It contains no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, with a focus on configuration and deployment options.",
