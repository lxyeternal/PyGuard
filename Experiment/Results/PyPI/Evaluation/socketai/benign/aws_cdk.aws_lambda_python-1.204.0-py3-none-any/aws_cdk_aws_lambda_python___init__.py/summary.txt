  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate infrastructure configuration code for AWS Lambda functions and layers, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent. The low risk scores reflect potential misuse if untrusted input is provided, but the code itself is safe and standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal (~0.1)."
