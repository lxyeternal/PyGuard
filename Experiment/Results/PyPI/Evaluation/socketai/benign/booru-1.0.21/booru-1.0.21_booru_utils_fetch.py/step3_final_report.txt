{
  "purpose": "Fetches data from booru sites, processes JSON and HTML responses, filters tags, and performs random selection.",
  "sources": "Network requests to site URLs, reading JSON responses, parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup, reading external constants and functions.",
  "sinks": "Data processing in Python variables, filtering tags, returning filtered lists, random selection from objects.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data -> JSON/HTML parsing -> tag splitting and filtering -> returning processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard web requests and data parsing using common libraries. It filters tags based on provided blocks, handles JSON and HTML responses appropriately, and performs random selection. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is evident. Exception handling is generic but not suspicious. External functions and constants appear benign. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with typical data-fetching utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard data fetching and processing, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified given the network interactions but does not indicate any threat. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, aligning with the straightforward nature of the code.",
