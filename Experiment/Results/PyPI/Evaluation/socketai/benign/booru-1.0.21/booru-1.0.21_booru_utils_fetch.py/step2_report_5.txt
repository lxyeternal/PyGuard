  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the code to assess accuracy, consistency, and potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches data from booru sites, processes JSON responses, splits tags, filters based on blocks, and performs random selection. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The logic in `request()` correctly handles JSON data, splitting tags, and filtering.\n  - No suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets.\n  - The \"malware\" score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n  - The confidence score of 0.9 seems reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable scores, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard web requests, JSON/HTML parsing, and safe handling. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code's flow matches the description.\n  - Use of `randint` for selection is standard.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n  - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, consistent, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes functions for fetching data and wildcards, with data flow from URL parameters to parsing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The `request_wildcard()` function performs HTML parsing, regex extraction, and filtering, all standard.\n  - The external functions (`ascii_to_str`, `Api`) are not detailed but appear benign.\n  - No signs of malicious code or malicious data handling.\n  - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, justified, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data fetching, JSON/HTML parsing, and filtering, with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is standard for such tasks.\n  - No malicious patterns detected.\n  - The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative but acceptable.\n  - Malware score of 0 aligns.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, describing data retrieval, filtering, and random selection, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code's behavior matches the description.\n  - No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n  - Scores are consistent.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a typical implementation for fetching and processing data from booru sites, with standard libraries and practices.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly conservative at 0.1-0.2, but given the network interactions and parsing, this is reasonable.\n- **Potential Risks:** No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or backdoors.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, typical for network code handling untrusted data)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
