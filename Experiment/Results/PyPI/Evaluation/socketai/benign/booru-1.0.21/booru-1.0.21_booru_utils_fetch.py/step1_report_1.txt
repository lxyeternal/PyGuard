{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to fetch and process image data from various booru-style image hosting websites, applying filters based on tags and returning the processed data.",
  "sources": "Data sources include HTTP GET requests to various websites, reading JSON responses, HTML content from BeautifulSoup parsing, and the random module for object selection.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include parsing JSON responses, HTML content extraction, and returning processed data without sanitization.",
  "flows": "Data is fetched via HTTP requests (sources), processed with JSON parsing and HTML parsing, then filtered and returned (sinks). The random module is used to select items from lists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs asynchronous HTTP requests to various URLs, parsing JSON and HTML responses to extract image tags and filter them based on specified blocks. The 'request' functions handle different site responses, splitting tags, and filtering. The 'roll' function randomly selects an item from a list. The 'request_wildcard' function fetches and parses HTML content to extract tags, converting them via 'ascii_to_str'. There are no evident security risks such as code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for fetching and filtering image metadata from booru sites. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious backdoors, or security risks based on its structure and content.",
