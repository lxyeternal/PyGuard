{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client for interacting with konachan.net API to search images and tags.",
  "sources": "Request functions 'request' and 'request_wildcard' from utils, environment variables via get_hostname, and input parameters such as query, block, limit, page.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed data via better_object, parse_image, or roll functions; raises exceptions; data is returned to caller, possibly after manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → request functions → data processing functions (append_object, parse_image) → return data or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 're.findall' for block filtering may be unnecessary but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical API requests and data processing for a search client. No suspicious external calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no hidden code. The request functions could potentially be used maliciously if they were hijacked, but as provided, they appear to be standard request wrappers. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage are detected. The only minor concern is the use of regex for blocking, which is unlikely malicious but could be misused in a different context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client for searching images and tags from konachan.net, with no evident malicious intent or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
