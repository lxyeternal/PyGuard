  "purpose": "A client class for interacting with konachan.net, performing image searches and tag lookups.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'query', 'block', 'limit', 'page'; external request functions 'request' and 'request_wildcard'.",
  "sinks": "Returns data from 'request' functions, processed with 'better_object' and 'parse_image'; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation beyond fetching.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> request functions -> data processing with 'better_object' and 'parse_image' -> return results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of external request functions is typical; no suspicious code paths observed; no obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for querying a public API and processing the results. It validates 'limit' and 'block' inputs, preventing excessive requests or regex injection issues. Data is fetched asynchronously and processed with helper functions. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. The usage of 'request' and 'request_wildcard' appears standard for API calls. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The only potential risk is mishandling of data returned from API calls, but functions like 'better_object' and 'parse_image' are assumed to sanitize or process data safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for a public image service with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It correctly validates inputs and uses external functions for data fetching and processing. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or malware indicators are detected.",
