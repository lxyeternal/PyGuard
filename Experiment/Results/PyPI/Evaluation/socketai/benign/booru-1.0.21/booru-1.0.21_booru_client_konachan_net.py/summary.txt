  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe API client with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Input validation is appropriate, and external functions are presumed secure. The minor regex concern does not elevate the security risk significantly. The overall security posture is low risk, with scores consistent across reports."
