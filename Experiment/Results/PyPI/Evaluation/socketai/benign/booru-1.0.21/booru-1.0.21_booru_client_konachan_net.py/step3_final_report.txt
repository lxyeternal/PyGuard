  "purpose": "Client for interacting with konachan.net API to search images, retrieve images, and find tags.",
  "sources": "Request functions (`request`, `request_wildcard`), user input parameters (`query`, `block`, `limit`, `page`), and external data processing functions (`better_object`, `parse_image`, `get_hostname`).",
  "sinks": "Data returned from request functions, processed by `better_object` and `parse_image`, and returned to caller; potential for data leaks if external functions are malicious, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (`query`, `block`, `limit`, `page`) -> validation checks -> request functions (`request`, `request_wildcard`) -> data processing (`append_object`, `better_object`, `parse_image`) -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `re.findall` with user-provided `block` parameter for regex matching; no obfuscation or suspicious code paths; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for konachan.net, performing search, image retrieval, and tag lookup. It validates inputs (`limit`, `block`) to prevent common issues. External request functions are assumed safe, and data is processed with helper functions presumed secure. No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The regex use for blocking tags could be misused in a malicious context but is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by minimal concerns. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for legitimate use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe API client with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Input validation is appropriate, and external functions are presumed secure. The minor regex concern does not elevate the security risk significantly. The overall security posture is low risk, with scores consistent across reports.",
