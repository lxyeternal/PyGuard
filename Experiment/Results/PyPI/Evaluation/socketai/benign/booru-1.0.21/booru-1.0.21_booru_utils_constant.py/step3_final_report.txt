  "purpose": "Utility module for managing API endpoints, parsing JSON responses, extracting image URLs, and handling URL hostname extraction for various booru image sites.",
  "sources": "Static URL definitions, JSON data received from API responses, headers and wildcard URL patterns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; functions process data internally without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON objects through parsing functions to URL extraction, with no external data exfiltration or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; hardcoded email address in headers is benign and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for URL management and JSON parsing. It contains no network activity beyond static URL definitions, no secrets or credentials, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The functions handle data safely and predictably. The high security risk score in the first report (0.95) is unjustified given the benign nature; it should be lowered to near zero. All other reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and low risk scores (0.1-0.2) reflecting minor privacy considerations. Overall, the code poses no supply chain or malicious security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for API URL management and data parsing. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The high risk score in the first report should be adjusted downward; otherwise, all assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
