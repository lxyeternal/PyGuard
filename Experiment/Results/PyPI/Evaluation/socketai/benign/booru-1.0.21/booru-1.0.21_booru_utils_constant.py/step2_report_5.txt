  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily a utility module for managing API endpoints, parsing JSON data, and extracting URLs.\n   - No report mentions any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - The code does not perform network requests beyond URL definitions, nor does it execute dynamic code or handle secrets.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n   - No significant logical flaws are apparent. The reports correctly interpret the functions and their benign nature.\n   - The only minor note is the broad exception handling in `parse_image`, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.\n   - The hardcoded email address in headers is noted but is benign in context.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with their conclusion of benignity.\n   - Security risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a high risk score; all indicate the code is straightforward, with no malicious activity.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain low.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**\n   - All reports agree on malware score = 0, which is justified given the benign analysis.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on unfounded assumptions; they base their assessments on code structure and behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, standard utility code)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code appears to be a benign utility module for API URL management and data parsing. There are no signs of supply chain security issues, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mostly due to hardcoded email, which is not malicious)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
