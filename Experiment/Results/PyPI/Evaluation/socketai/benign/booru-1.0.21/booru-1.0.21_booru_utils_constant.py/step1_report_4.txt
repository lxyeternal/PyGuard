{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for managing API endpoints and utility functions for parsing and processing image data from various image booru APIs.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from JSON objects, API endpoint URLs, and environment variables (via __version__).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include JSON parsing, URL manipulation, and data handling functions that process image URLs and JSON data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON objects (source) through parsing functions like parse_image, parse_image_danbooru, and resolve, which extract image URLs or JSON content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data found. The only notable pattern is URL and JSON data parsing; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. The ascii_to_str function replaces URL-encoded characters, which is benign. The __version__ imported from booru is used to set the User-Agent header, but its content is unknown, though likely harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of API endpoint definitions, URL and JSON parsing functions, and utility methods for string replacement. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication to unknown domains, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The functions perform standard data processing tasks. The use of __version__ in headers is standard for versioning, assuming __version__ is a safe string. The functions handle data parsing robustly, catching exceptions without executing untrusted code. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a legitimate helper module for API interaction and data parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard, benign utility module for handling API endpoints, JSON data, and URL parsing related to booru image sites. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks within this module. The only minor concern could be the content of __version__, but it is unlikely to pose a security threat.",
