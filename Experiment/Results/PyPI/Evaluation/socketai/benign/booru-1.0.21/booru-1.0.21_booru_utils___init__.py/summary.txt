  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the benign or empty nature of the code snippets. The main adjustment needed is for Report 4: if actual code contains dynamic execution functions like eval or exec, the malware and security risk scores should be increased accordingly. Otherwise, the current scores are appropriate. Overall, the supply chain risk appears minimal based on the provided information."
