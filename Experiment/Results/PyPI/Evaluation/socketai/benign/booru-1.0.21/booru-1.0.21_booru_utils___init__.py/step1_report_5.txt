  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility module that performs data processing, likely related to user input or external data sources.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network sources (if present in the full code).",
  "sinks": "Uses data in functions that could execute system commands, write to files, or send data over the network (if implemented).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to potential sinks such as system calls or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data manipulation, possibly validating or transforming input data. No malicious API calls, system modifications, or network communications are evident. No suspicious imports or dynamic execution. The code appears straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to serve a benign purpose with no suspicious elements detected.",
