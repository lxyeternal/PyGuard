  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the 'booru' Python package for distribution, including reading version info, requirements, and long description.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from booru/__init__.py, requirements from requirements.txt, and README content from README.md.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted external data sources, nor does it perform network operations or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and requirements, then passes these into setup(). No untrusted data flow to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads static files and extracts data using regex, then configures package setup parameters. All operations are typical for Python package configuration. No external data is fetched or processed insecurely. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It correctly reads necessary metadata and configures the package without any suspicious activities.",
