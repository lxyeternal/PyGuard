{
  "purpose": "The code serves to configure the package setup by reading version info, requirements, and README content, then invoking setuptools.setup() with this data.",
  "sources": "Reading '__init__.py' for version, 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and 'README.md' for description.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses the collected data directly; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Source files are read into variables, which are then passed to setup() without modification or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads static files, extracts version info via regex, and calls setup() with predefined metadata. There is no code execution based on untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation. The version extraction via regex is common practice. The overall structure is clear and conventional, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0.1 (which can be confidently set to 0). The code poses no security threat.",
