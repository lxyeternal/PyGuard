  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The script is a straightforward setup configuration. It reads static files, extracts version info via regex, and sets package metadata. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, perhaps due to the dynamic version extraction, but this is standard practice.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the script is a standard package setup with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** No issues, typical package configuration.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; the script reads static files and configures package setup without any malicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard practice.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; no suspicious or malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, confirms the script is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Completely standard.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard practices.  \n- **Risk Scores:** Given the benign nature, the risk scores should be 0 or very close to it. The small risk score of 0.1 in Report 1 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n### Final Justified Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malware or malicious activity detected in any report.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and standard.  \n- **Risk:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n**Overall, this is a safe, standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.**",
