{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up and configuring the Python package 'booru', including reading version info, requirements, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading files: '__init__.py' for version, 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, 'README.md' for description.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function where package metadata and dependencies are defined and possibly executed.",
  "flows": "File reading (source) → variable assignment → setup() configuration (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No network activity, file modifications, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a source file, reads dependencies, and loads a README for package description. It then calls setup() with static and dynamically loaded data. There are no suspicious code constructs, obfuscated sections, or potentially malicious actions. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices and does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads package metadata and invokes the setup() function for package installation.",
