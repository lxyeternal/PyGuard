{
  "purpose": "The code prepares package metadata and dependencies for the 'booru' Python project to facilitate its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from booru/__init__.py, requirements from requirements.txt, and README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; data is used for package setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> sets up package metadata -> loads dependencies and description -> invokes setup() with data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward reading of static files and invokes setuptools.setup() with collected data. All operations are read-only and relate to package configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of regular expressions and file operations are standard. The code does not handle untrusted input in a risky manner, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. It appears to be a benign and typical implementation for project setup.",
