  "purpose": "This script sets up the package configuration for a Python project named 'booru', including version extraction, requirements parsing, and metadata definitions for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'booru/__init__.py', reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt', reads README content from 'README.md', and static metadata within the script.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if 'version' or 'requirements.txt' contain malicious content, but these are read and processed as plain text. No code executes based on these inputs. No network or file operations beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Reads version string -> stores in variable; Reads requirements -> stores in list; Reads README -> stores as long_description; uses these variables in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward setup configuration. No dynamic code execution or untrusted input processing that could be exploited.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info, requirements, and documentation. It safely extracts the version using regex, reads static files without executing or evaluating their content, and defines package metadata. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present. The only dynamic element is reading the version from a file, which is common practice and not risky. No external network operations, no code injection, or secret leaks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security threats. It is a standard, safe configuration code.",
