  "purpose": "Module initialization importing client classes for various image hosting services and setting version.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version assignment; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static imports with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static imports of classes and sets a version string. There are no dynamic behaviors, network operations, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The structure is typical for a module setup. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, indicating clear code. The security risk score is minimal (0), as the code is benign and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores should be set to 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, reflecting its benign and straightforward nature.",
