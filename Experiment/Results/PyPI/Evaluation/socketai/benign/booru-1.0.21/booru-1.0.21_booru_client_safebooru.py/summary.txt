  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent API client with proper validation and URL handling. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The main concern is the regex filtering, which could be exploited but does not constitute malicious activity. External dependencies should be reviewed separately for security. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate."
