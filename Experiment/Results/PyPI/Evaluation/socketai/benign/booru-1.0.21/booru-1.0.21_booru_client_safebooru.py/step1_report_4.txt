{
  "purpose": "Client for interacting with Safebooru API to search images, find tags, and manipulate data.",
  "sources": "Request functions 'request' and 'request_wildcard' that fetch data from external APIs.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from external requests and functions like 'better_object', 'parse_image', and 'roll' which process data.",
  "flows": "External request functions -> data processing functions -> returned results; user input (queries, blocks) influence request parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of re.findall for block filtering without sanitization could cause regex issues; no explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as an API client, fetching and processing data from Safebooru. It uses external request functions and processes the data accordingly. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic like hidden network calls, credential theft, or data exfiltration is present. The use of request functions and data manipulation appears standard for a client library. Error handling is basic and does not involve sensitive info. No malware-like behaviors such as system modification, network exfiltration, or backdoors detected. The code structure and imports suggest legitimate functionality without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate API client for Safebooru with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident.",
