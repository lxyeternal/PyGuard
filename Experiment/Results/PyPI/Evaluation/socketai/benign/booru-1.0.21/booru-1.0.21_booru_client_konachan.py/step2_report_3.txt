  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API client for Konachan, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns, external request functions presumed safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious indicators detected. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interaction with minimal concern.\n- **Key points:** No secrets, no obfuscation, use of re.findall on user input is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the regex usage isn't malicious. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with no malicious intent.\n- **Key points:** Minor regex concern but unlikely malicious, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard API client, no malicious activity.\n- **Key points:** Use of re.findall on user input is a minor concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—no signs of malicious behavior, standard API client.\n- **Key points:** No backdoors, no obfuscation, potential regex issues are minor.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. No malicious code, payloads, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across reports, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to the use of user input in regex matching, which is a common pattern but should be handled carefully.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Minor concern about regex handling, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The use of `re.findall` with user-controlled input (`block`) could, in theory, lead to regex denial-of-service if misused, but given the context, it does not appear malicious.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise, secret leaks, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe scores provided are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis. The overall security posture of this code is very good, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risk score reflects a cautious approach to regex handling but does not indicate a significant threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No adjustments necessary.",
