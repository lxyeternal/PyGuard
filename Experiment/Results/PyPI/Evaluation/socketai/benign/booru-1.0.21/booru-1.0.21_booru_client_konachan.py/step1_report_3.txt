{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client for the Konachan image API, enabling search, image retrieval, and tag lookup functions.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as 'query' and 'block'; configuration constants from imported modules; network requests via 'request' and 'request_wildcard'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests that send search queries and parameters; data processing functions that may handle untrusted data; functions that return image data or tags.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in 'request' calls to fetch data; the data is processed and returned, with possible shuffling or selection; no direct flow from untrusted source to sensitive sink is evident beyond standard network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 're.findall' for blocking tags could potentially lead to unintended matches if 'block' contains regex special characters; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no evidence of data exfiltration, system commands, or suspicious network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for interacting with the Konachan API, performing search and tag retrieval functions. Input parameters like 'query' and 'block' are used to form requests, which are sent via external 'request' functions. The use of 're.findall' on 'block' without sanitization might pose a minor risk if 'block' contains malicious regex, but it is unlikely to be malicious. The code does not include any suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks. There are no hardcoded secrets or hidden code. The overall structure appears typical for an API client, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client for a public image service, with no evident malicious intent or security risks. Minor attention to regex handling is noted but not suspicious. Overall, it is safe.",
