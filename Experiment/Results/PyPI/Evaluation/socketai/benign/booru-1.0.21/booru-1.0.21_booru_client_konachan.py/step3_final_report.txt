  "purpose": "A Python API client for Konachan, providing search, image retrieval, and tag functions by interacting with external APIs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as query, block, limit, page; external request functions request, request_wildcard.",
  "sinks": "External API requests, data processing, and returning processed data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> request functions -> data processing -> output results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of re.findall with user input ('block') which could cause regex issues but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. External request functions are assumed safe. Minor regex usage with user input poses a potential performance concern but not malicious. No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with safe, standard API interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, transparent API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is regex usage with user input, which does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low, approximately 0.2. The code aligns with the reviewed reports and can be considered safe for use.",
