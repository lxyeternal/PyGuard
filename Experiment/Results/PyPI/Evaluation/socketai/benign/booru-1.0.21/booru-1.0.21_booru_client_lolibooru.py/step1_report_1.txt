{
  "purpose": "A client class for searching and retrieving images and tags from the Lolibooru API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: query, block, limit, page, gacha; Data fetched from API via request/request_wildcard functions.",
  "sinks": "API request functions (request, request_wildcard), data returned and processed via better_object, parse_image, roll.",
  "flows": "User provides query/parameters -> request functions fetch data -> data is processed and returned or shuffled -> potential for data manipulation at each step.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code relies on external request functions; no malicious payloads are embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical API request handling for image search and tag retrieval. It includes input validation (limit checks, regex matching to prevent same-value block queries). The use of external request functions suggests reliance on properly implemented modules. No obfuscated code, suspicious network connections, or malicious data handling identified. No hardcoded secrets, credential theft mechanisms, or covert data exfiltration observed. Overall, the code appears standard and safe, assuming external functions are secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client implementation with standard input validation and data handling. No signs of malicious intent or malware, and no security risks detected within this module.",
