  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a client for the Lolibooru API, performing image and tag searches.\n- They highlight standard input validation (limit checks, regex filtering).\n- External functions (`request`, `request_wildcard`, `better_object`, `parse_image`, `roll`) are used, which are assumed to be implemented securely.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are identified.\n- Use of `shuffle` and `roll` introduces randomness but is benign.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No, all reports indicate the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is a typical API client.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  The input validation (limits, regex filtering) seems appropriate. No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, and `risk=0.2`. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, possibly reflecting reliance on external request functions and network interactions, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, indicating low but not zero risk, which is reasonable for an API client.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are observed, scores should remain low.\n- If the external request functions are secure, then the overall risk remains minimal.\n- The use of regex filtering and input validation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The code relies heavily on external functions (`request`, `request_wildcard`, etc.). If these are insecure, the overall security could be compromised. However, based on the reports, these are assumed to be secure.\n- The use of `shuffle` and `roll` introduces randomness but is not malicious.\n- No obfuscation or hidden backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to external dependencies and network interactions, but no vulnerabilities identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard API client with proper validation and no malicious behavior. The assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code, assuming external request functions are secure.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways verify the security of external dependencies. If those are secure, the overall security posture of this module remains low risk.",
