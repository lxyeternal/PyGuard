{
  "purpose": "A client wrapper for the Lolibooru API, providing search, image-only search, and tag lookup functionalities.",
  "sources": "Network request functions (`request`, `request_wildcard`), data processing functions (`better_object`, `parse_image`, `roll`), and input parameters such as `query`, `block`, `limit`, `page`.",
  "sinks": "External request functions that perform network calls, potential data returned from these requests, and the use of `shuffle` and `roll` for randomization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (`query`, `block`, `limit`, `page`) are validated, then used to construct API requests via external functions. Data is fetched, processed, and optionally shuffled or randomly selected before being returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of regex for blocking tags is standard. External functions are assumed secure; no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with input validation, URL construction, and data fetching via external functions. It performs benign operations, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of randomness functions is benign. External dependencies are assumed secure. The validation checks prevent obvious misuse. Overall, the code is standard, transparent, and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured API client with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are consistent with the analysis. The high confidence score reflects the thorough review.",
