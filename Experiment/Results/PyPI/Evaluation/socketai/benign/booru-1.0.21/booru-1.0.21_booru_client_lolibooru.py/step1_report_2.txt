  "purpose": "Client class for searching and retrieving images and tags from Lolibooru API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for search queries (query, block, limit, page), environment variables, imported request functions.",
  "sinks": "Request functions (request, request_wildcard), data processing (append_object, parse_image), returning data to callers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> request functions -> data processing -> return of images/tags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious network domains, no suspicious data leaks, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a client for querying an external API and processing responses. It uses imported functions for HTTP requests and data handling, with validation on inputs (limits, block tags). No direct use of environment variables or system data, nor dynamic code execution is present. Functions include data appending, shuffling, and formatting responses. No indication of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. The random module is used only for shuffling responses, which is benign. Error handling is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign API client for fetching images and tags from Lolibooru. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The implementation is standard, with input validation and data processing. The overall security risk is low.",
