{
  "purpose": "This code calculates the maximum flow in a directed graph using linear programming via the glpk library.",
  "sources": "Reads capgraph (edge list with capacities), source node 's', and sink node 't'. Uses graph data to set up LP variables and constraints.",
  "sinks": "Generates flow values for each edge, potentially exposing flow distribution if accessed externally.",
  "flows": "Source node and edge capacity constraints, flow conservation constraints for non-source/non-sink nodes, and LP optimization to maximize flow from s to t.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Uses standard LP setup for max flow.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a linear programming problem to solve for max flow. It maps nodes to LP rows, defines flow variables for edges, and constrains flow capacities. It sets up the objective to maximize flow from s to t, and solves the LP with glpk. No untrusted input is used beyond the provided graph data, and no network or system calls are made. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of max flow calculation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard max flow algorithm using linear programming without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It relies on the glpk library for LP solving and operates purely on provided graph data. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
