  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of max flow via LP with the glpk library. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to environment variable usage. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
