  "purpose": "Compute the maximum flow in a capacity graph using linear programming via the glpk library.",
  "sources": "Reads capacity graph data (capgraph), source node 's', sink node 't', and glpk library functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns flow assignment for each edge in the graph with computed flow values.",
  "flows": "Capgraph input -> flow calculation -> flow assignment in returned list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of glpk appears standard for LP solving.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a maximum flow problem as a linear program, mapping nodes to constraints, defining variables (flows), and maximizing total flow from source to sink. It uses glpk library for LP solving, correctly constructs the constraint matrix, and interprets LP results to assign flow values. No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. Usage of glpk is typical for optimization problems, and no data leaks or malicious injections are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a maximum flow algorithm using linear programming. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. It is a legitimate computational routine for flow optimization with no security risks detected.",
