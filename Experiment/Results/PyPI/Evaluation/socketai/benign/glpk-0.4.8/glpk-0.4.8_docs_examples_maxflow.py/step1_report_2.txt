  "purpose": "Compute the maximum flow in a given capacity graph using linear programming via the glpk library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'capgraph' list parameter, which contains edges and capacities, and also from environment variables/settings within the glpk library.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs flow values for each edge as a list of tuples; it does not directly output or store sensitive data. No other explicit sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink path flows are computed through LP formulation, with constraints linking node flows to edge flows. The flow values are derived from LP variable solutions assigned to edges.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The use of glpk for LP solving is standard for max flow algorithms. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or hidden backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard max flow algorithm using linear programming with the glpk library. It maps nodes to LP variables, sets up constraints, and solves for maximum flow. No malicious logic or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, with clear flow from input graph data to output flow values. No external data leaks, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network or file operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a typical max flow calculation with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate implementation of a max flow algorithm using glpk. No malware or security threats are detected.",
