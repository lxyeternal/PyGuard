  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurately describes the code as setting up a linear programming model for max flow, with correct node mapping, constraints, and LP solving. The report notes no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malware, and a benign environment variable usage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; the code is a standard max flow LP implementation with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the standard approach, environment variable handling, and absence of suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — slightly elevated securityRisk, but given the benign environment variable use, this seems conservative.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is a straightforward max flow LP model.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports, describes LP formulation, node mapping, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, standard LP max flow implementation, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, describes a standard LP approach, no suspicious patterns, no external network activity, benign environment variable usage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code matches all descriptions: it is a standard maximum flow implementation via linear programming using the glpk library.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. All reports agree.\n\n- **Security Risks:** No suspicious activities, no hardcoded credentials, no network or file system operations, only LP setup and solving.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low or zero security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \nThe code is a textbook implementation of maximum flow via LP. The use of environment variables to control terminal output is standard practice. No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, well-structured, and implements a common algorithm without obfuscation or malware. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a minimal security risk score, if any.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis reflects the code's nature as a standard, open-source maximum flow LP solver implementation.",
