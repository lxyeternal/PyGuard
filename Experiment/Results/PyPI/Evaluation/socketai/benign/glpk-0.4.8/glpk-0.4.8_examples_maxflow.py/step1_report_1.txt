  "purpose": "To compute the maximum flow in a given capacity graph using linear programming with the glpk library.",
  "sources": "Reads input graph data via the capgraph parameter; reads environment variable 'glpk.env.term_on' to control message output.",
  "sinks": "Assigns flow variables and constraints; outputs the flow values for each edge in the result.",
  "flows": "Source nodes 's' influence the objective function; edges contribute to the constraint matrix, which then flows to the LP solver; the solution assigns flow values back to edges.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors; straightforward LP formulation; environment variable manipulation is benign; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a linear programming model to maximize flow from source 's' to sink 't' in a capacity graph, defining variables for each edge with bounds, setting the objective, and adding flow conservation constraints for non-source/sink nodes. It configures the LP solver, runs simplex, and then returns the flow values. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The use of glpk environment variable is standard for suppressing messages. The code is clean, with clear purpose and no signs of obfuscation or malware. It performs a typical maximum flow computation via LP.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of maximum flow calculation using linear programming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward, well-structured script performing standard operations without suspicious elements.",
