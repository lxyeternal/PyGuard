{
  "purpose": "The code implements a SAT solver using linear programming and mixed-integer programming via the glpk library. It generates random CNF formulas, attempts to find satisfying assignments, and verifies solutions.",
  "sources": "Input seed from command line, internal CNF formula generation, and the expression data structure.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file system modifications; all operations are internal.",
  "flows": "Seed input influences formula generation; formulas are processed through LP/MIP solving; solutions are verified internally.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or hidden behaviors are present. Usage of glpk is standard for such optimization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent, well-structured implementation of a SAT solver that employs LP and MIP techniques. It generates random CNF formulas, formulates the problem for glpk, solves it, and verifies the results. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected. The code relies on standard libraries and does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a SAT solver suitable for educational or research purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security threats.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
