  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import of get_distribution from pkg_resources, configuration variables, and comments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct untrusted data processing or execution points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mostly static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The use of get_distribution is benign and standard for version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic code execution or user input handling. It imports a benign function from a well-known package, 'pkg_resources', to obtain version info. The rest of the code sets static configuration options for documentation generation, with no indication of suspicious behavior. There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical documentation build configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It solely manages static configuration for Sphinx and imports a standard package function for versioning.",
