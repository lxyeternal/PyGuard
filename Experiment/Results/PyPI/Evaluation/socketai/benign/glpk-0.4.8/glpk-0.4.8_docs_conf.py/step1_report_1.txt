  "purpose": "Configuration setup for generating documentation for the 'pyglpk' project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import of 'get_distribution' from 'pkg_resources' to obtain package version info.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks of untrusted data or external influence; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow is static import and usage of 'get_distribution' to determine version info, which is a controlled, read-only operation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; the code strictly follows standard Sphinx configuration patterns. The only notable operation is retrieving the 'glpk' package version, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no external data transmission. The import of 'get_distribution' is used solely to get version info for documentation purposes. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs. All code is static and configuration-oriented, consistent with typical documentation setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security or contain malware.",
