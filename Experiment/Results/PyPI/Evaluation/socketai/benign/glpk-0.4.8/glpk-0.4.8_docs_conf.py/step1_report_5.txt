  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx for the 'pyglpk' package.",
  "sources": "Import from pkg_resources to get distribution version; reading configuration variables and settings for Sphinx.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from imported modules and static configuration variables; no dynamic or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. The code is standard for a Sphinx documentation configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file with static setup for documentation generation, including theme, paths, and project info. It imports version info dynamically from a package distribution, which is a common pattern. There are no indications of code execution based on untrusted input, no network operations, and no embedded malicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign configuration file for documentation with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
