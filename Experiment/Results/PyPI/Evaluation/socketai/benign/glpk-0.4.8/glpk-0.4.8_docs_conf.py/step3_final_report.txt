  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation, setting up extensions, paths, project info, and output options.",
  "sources": "The only dynamic source is the call to get_distribution('glpk').version to retrieve the package version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing get_distribution and calling it to assign the version string; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is static, straightforward, and follows standard configuration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It imports a standard library function to retrieve package version info, which is safe. No user input, network activity, or code execution occurs. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for documentation setup. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The supply chain security assessment is clean, and no further action is necessary.",
