  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx for the 'pyglpk' project.",
  "sources": "Import from 'pkg_resources' to get distribution version; configuration variables set directly within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted input or lead to security risks; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "N/A – no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. The script primarily sets static configuration values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for documentation build setup. It imports 'get_distribution' from 'pkg_resources' to retrieve package version info, which is safe and typical. All configuration parameters are static, intended to control documentation output. There are no input or output functions that process untrusted data, nor any code that dynamically executes code or interacts with external systems in a suspicious manner. The script does not contain malware indicators such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It is purely a configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard, benign Sphinx documentation configuration script. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues. The use of 'get_distribution' to obtain package version info is safe. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
