  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'pyglpk' project.",
  "sources": "Import of 'get_distribution' from 'pkg_resources' to retrieve package version info.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves retrieving the version of the 'glpk' package and setting it as the project release info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is standard configuration for documentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with comments and settings for building project documentation. It imports 'get_distribution' to dynamically set the package version, which is standard practice. No user input, external untrusted data, or code execution mechanisms are present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate documentation configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate configuration file for generating documentation with Sphinx. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
