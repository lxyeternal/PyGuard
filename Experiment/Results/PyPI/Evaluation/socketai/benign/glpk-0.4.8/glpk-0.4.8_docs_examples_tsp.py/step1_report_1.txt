{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver using the GLPK optimization library to find the minimum-cost cycle covering all nodes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'edges' parameter, which contains edge information including node pairs and costs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that send data externally or to untrusted sources. No external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data (edges) is processed to set up the LP model; the LP solver attempts to find an optimal solution; no external data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard GLPK library functions; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a linear programming model for TSP using GLPK, setting up variables, constraints, and the objective function. It performs standard LP solving and integer rounding procedures to find a feasible cycle. There are no signs of malicious data handling or harmful operations. The code appears to be a legitimate optimization implementation without suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard TSP solver implementation using the GLPK library with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and focused solely on solving the optimization problem.",
