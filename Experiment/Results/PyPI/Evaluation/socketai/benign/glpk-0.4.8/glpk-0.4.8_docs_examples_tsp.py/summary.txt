  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of a TSP solver using GLPK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is justified due to reliance on an external library and environment variable manipulation, but it does not indicate malicious intent."
