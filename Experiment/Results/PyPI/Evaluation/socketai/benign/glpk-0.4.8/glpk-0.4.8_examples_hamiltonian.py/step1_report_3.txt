{
  "purpose": "This code implements algorithms to solve Hamiltonian path and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances using linear programming via the glpk library.",
  "sources": "Reads input edges (g1, g2, g3) for graph representations and their associated costs for TSP.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input edges are processed into LP variables; LP is formulated and solved; solutions are returned as selected edges.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls detected. Use of 'glpk' appears standard for LP solving.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for solving Hamiltonian path and TSP problems using linear programming. It sets up LP variables, constraints, and objectives, then solves using 'glpk'. The logic appears consistent with standard LP formulations for these problems. No obfuscated constructs, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious data handling are present. The code uses a legitimate library 'glpk' for LP solving, and there are no signs of malicious data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Hamiltonian and TSP solvers using linear programming, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not perform any network communication, data theft, or system manipulation. Overall, it appears safe with no security risks identified.",
