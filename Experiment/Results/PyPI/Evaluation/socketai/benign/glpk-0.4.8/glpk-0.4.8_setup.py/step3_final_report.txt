  "purpose": "Build configuration script for the 'glpk' Python extension module, handling environment variables, command-line arguments, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('GLPK'), command-line arguments ('--with-glpk='), and version control via setuptools_scm.",
  "sinks": "Paths used for include_dirs, library_dirs, and macros; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and CLI args influence path variables and macros; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of sys.argv for custom build options; use of environment variables without validation, but standard in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build setup script for a Python C extension, configuring paths based on environment variables and CLI options. It fetches version info, sets macros, and defines an Extension object accordingly. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The environment variables and CLI args are used for configuration, which is common practice. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build configuration script with no malicious intent. The use of environment variables and command-line arguments introduces minimal security risk, typical for such scripts. No malware or obfuscation detected. Overall security risk is very low.",
