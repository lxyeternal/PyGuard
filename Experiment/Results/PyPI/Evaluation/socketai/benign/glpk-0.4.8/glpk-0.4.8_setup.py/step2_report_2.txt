  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate build script for a Python C extension, handling environment variables, command-line args, and versioning.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to environment variable reliance.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the script as standard build code with no malicious intent. The slight security risk score accounts for potential manipulation of environment variables, which is typical in build scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build configuration with environment variables and command-line args.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, possibly due to the dynamic nature of environment variables.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The script's use of environment variables and argument parsing is standard, with no malicious behavior. The security risk is appropriately low but acknowledges the potential for environment variable manipulation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical build setup script, handling environment variables and CLI options.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly notes that no malicious activity is present. The potential risk is minimal and typical for such scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard build configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report rightly concludes that this is a safe, legitimate build script with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script with environment variables and CLI options influencing build configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. While the script manipulates environment variables and command-line arguments, this is typical for build scripts. No malicious activity or code injection is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual malicious code or behavior. All focus on standard build configuration practices.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, primarily related to environment variable reliance, which is common and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a straightforward build configuration script.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The manipulation of environment variables and command-line arguments is typical in build scripts.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, due to reliance on environment variables, but standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe. No further security concerns are warranted based on the provided information.",
