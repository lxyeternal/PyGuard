  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Python extension module using setuptools and setuptools_scm, configuring build parameters for GLPK library integration.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (GLPK path), command-line arguments (e.g., --with-glpk=), and version information from get_version().",
  "sinks": "Passing data to the Extension constructor, environment variable access, and command-line argument modifications that could influence build configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line arguments serve as sources; these influence the extension build configuration (include_dirs, library_dirs, define_macros).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected; usage of environment variables and command-line args is standard for build configuration. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures build parameters for a C extension module, reading environment variables and command-line args to determine library and include paths. It appends paths based on env variables and CLI options, formats version info conditionally, and defines build macros. The code does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. The logic is straightforward and typical of build scripts. No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build setup script for a Python C extension module, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
