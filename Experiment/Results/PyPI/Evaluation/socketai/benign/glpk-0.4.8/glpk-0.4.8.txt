      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build configuration script with no malicious intent. The use of environment variables and command-line arguments introduces minimal security risk, typical for such scripts. No malware or obfuscation detected. Overall security risk is very low."

The only minor operational concern is the use of assertions that could cause abrupt termination, but this does not indicate security risk. Overall, the code is safe and benign."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of a TSP solver using GLPK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is justified due to reliance on an external library and environment variable manipulation, but it does not indicate malicious intent."

The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to environment variable usage. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
