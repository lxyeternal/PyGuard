  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling, with scores appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The overall supply chain security risk from this code is negligible."
