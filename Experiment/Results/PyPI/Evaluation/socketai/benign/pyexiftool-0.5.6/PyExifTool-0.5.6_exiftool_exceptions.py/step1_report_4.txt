{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the PyExifTool library, including process state errors, execution errors, JSON parsing errors, and version/tag validation issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and exception handling logic; no input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no data processing, output, or network communication occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data propagation paths in this code; it's solely for error class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and well-structured; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or external data handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes to handle different error scenarios within the PyExifTool package. It includes process state errors, execution errors, JSON errors, and version/tag validation errors. The classes are straightforward, inheriting from the base Exception class or other custom exceptions, with no data processing, network activity, or code injection. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is static, well-documented, and intended for structured error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely for defining exception classes for error handling in a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It is standard, safe, and intended for internal error management.",
