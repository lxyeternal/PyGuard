{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes used within the PyExifTool library for handling errors related to the execution and process management of the exiftool subprocess.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (e.g., message, exit_status, cmd_stdout, cmd_stderr, params, bad_tag), which are used for exception messages and data. No external data sources or user inputs are directly read in this file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code, as it only defines exception classes without any data output, network activity, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Since the code only consists of class definitions for exceptions, there are no data flows or source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code contains only standard exception class definitions with straightforward message handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for error handling within a Python package related to exiftool. It includes classes for process state errors, execution errors, JSON output errors, and version/tag validation errors. No external data reading, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The classes inherit from built-in exceptions and are used solely for control flow and error reporting. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The structure is typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code serves its purpose of structured error handling without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
