{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling within the PyExifTool library, serving as structured error reporting mechanisms.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user input, or data reads; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the classes are instantiated with error messages but do not process external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, with constructors setting messages and storing error details. It contains no system calls, external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is standard for error handling modules, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, static code used for structured error reporting within a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling, with scores appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The overall supply chain security risk from this code is negligible.",
