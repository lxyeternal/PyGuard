{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the PyExifTool library, including process states, execution errors, JSON handling, and version/tag issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads input mainly from the parameters passed during exception instantiation (e.g., message, exit_status, cmd_stdout, cmd_stderr, bad_tag). It does not read external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code. There are no operations that write or send data over a network or file system.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks occurs in this code. It solely defines exception classes with no active data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code behaviors such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of custom exception class definitions used by the PyExifTool library. It is purely for error handling and does not execute any system commands, read external data, or perform operations that could be malicious. No code injection, backdoors, or data leaks are present. All exception classes inherit from base exception classes and include attributes to store error details. There is no indication of malicious intent or malicious code. The structure and content are typical for a Python error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling within the PyExifTool library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leakage mechanisms, and no signs of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is minimal.",
