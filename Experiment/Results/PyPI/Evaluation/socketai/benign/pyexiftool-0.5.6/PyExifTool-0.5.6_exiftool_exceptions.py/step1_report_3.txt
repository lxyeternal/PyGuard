{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the PyExifTool library, primarily related to subprocess management, execution errors, and JSON processing.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and error handling mechanisms without reading input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks or data leak points since no data processing or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the classes are used for exception handling and do not process or transfer untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code strictly defines exception classes with standard constructor implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for exception handling related to subprocess execution, version, and tag validation errors. There are no data inputs, network interactions, or code execution functions present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are evident. The structure is straightforward, and the functionality aligns with standard error handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining custom exceptions for the PyExifTool library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It is safe and intended for error management purposes.",
