  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to the PyExifTool library.\n- There are no data inputs, external data reads, network activity, or code execution beyond class definitions.\n- The exception classes include attributes for error details but do not perform any malicious actions.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for error handling modules.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or external interactions.\n- The purpose and logic of the code are clear and standard for exception handling.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n- The code is purely for defining exceptions; it does not perform any harmful operations.\n- The detailed class attributes and messages are standard for error reporting.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the code is static and safe.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe, and benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- There are no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious payloads.\n- The security scores should remain at **0** for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I agree with the provided reports' assessments.\n- The code does not warrant any concern regarding malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, benign part of a Python error handling framework with no security issues.",
