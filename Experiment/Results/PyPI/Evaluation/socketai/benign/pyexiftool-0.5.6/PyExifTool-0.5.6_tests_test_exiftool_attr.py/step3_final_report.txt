{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests validating the behavior of the exiftool Python wrapper, focusing on attribute access, error handling, and process control.",
  "sources": "Reading the test image file TEST_IMAGE_JPG, accessing class attributes, and invoking methods within the exiftool library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network operations, or external command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Test code reads from local files and class attributes; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, interacting only with local files and the exiftool library. It performs attribute validation, exception handling, and process management in a standard manner. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The tests are well-structured and focus solely on expected behaviors. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite with no malicious or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
