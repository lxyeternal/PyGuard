  "purpose": "Unit testing for the exiftool Python wrapper, specifically validating attribute behaviors and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exiftool, pathlib, and test helpers; test input file path (TEST_IMAGE_JPG).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network calls, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are used in method calls; no untrusted data flows to system commands or external services.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The test code appears standard and focused on attribute validation and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for the exiftool wrapper class. It tests attribute access, exception raising, and behavior when starting/stopping the process. No system calls, network operations, or malicious logic are present. No signs of backdoors, hidden functionality, or malicious code segments. The code strictly performs attribute validation and exception handling for a known library, with no external or untrusted data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for validation of the exiftool Python wrapper's attributes and behaviors, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
