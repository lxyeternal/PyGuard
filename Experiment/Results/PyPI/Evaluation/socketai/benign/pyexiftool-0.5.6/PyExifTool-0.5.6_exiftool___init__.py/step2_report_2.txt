  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a setup module for a Python library interfacing with ExifTool.\n- It contains licensing, documentation, versioning, and import statements.\n- There are no data processing, user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code is standard for an open-source library initialization file.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there's no evident security concern or vulnerability.\n- **Analysis of claims:** All reports correctly identify the code as standard setup and documentation, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores or reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments. The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**. The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat.",
