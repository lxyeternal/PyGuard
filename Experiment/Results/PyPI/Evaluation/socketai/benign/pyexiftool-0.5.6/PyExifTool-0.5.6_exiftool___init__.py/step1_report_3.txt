{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python library for interfacing with the ExifTool command-line application to extract metadata from image files.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are directly read in this code; it mainly imports modules and defines version info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data processing paths involving untrusted data within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code establishes module imports and documentation but does not include runtime data flows or data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward library setup and documentation.",
  "analysis": "This code primarily contains licensing information, module imports, documentation, and versioning details. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The imports and comments suggest a library that interacts with an external command-line tool, but the interaction code is not shown here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Python library setup for a metadata extraction tool. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident in this code fragment.",
