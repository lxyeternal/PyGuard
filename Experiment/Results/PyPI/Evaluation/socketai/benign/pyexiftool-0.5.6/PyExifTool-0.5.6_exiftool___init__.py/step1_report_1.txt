  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python library to interface with the ExifTool command-line application, allowing users to extract metadata from image files efficiently.",
  "sources": "It does not contain input reading mechanisms; it primarily imports modules and defines versioning information.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data output sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks are present; the code mainly sets up module imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The license comments are standard. No dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module setup with licensing, import statements, versioning, and documentation. It imports public modules and sets up the library's public interface. No user input handling, network operations, or insecure code practices are present. The structure aligns with typical open-source library files and shows no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for a Python library interfacing with ExifTool. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and poses no security risks based on the provided snippet.",
