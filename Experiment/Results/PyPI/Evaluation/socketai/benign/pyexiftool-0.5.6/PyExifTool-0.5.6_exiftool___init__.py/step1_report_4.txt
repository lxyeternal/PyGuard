{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python library to interface with the ExifTool command-line application for extracting metadata from images.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes from the same package, including exceptions, exiftool, helper, and experimental modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input/output operations, or network communication are present that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and documentation; it does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. All code is standard library setup and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines versioning info, imports relevant modules, and provides documentation and licensing details. There are no operations that handle external input, execute commands, or perform unsafe actions. The presence of comments and license info indicates standard open-source project setup. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup and documentation for an open-source Python library interfacing with ExifTool. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
