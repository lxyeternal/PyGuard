{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the initialization and documentation module for the PyExifTool Python library, providing versioning, licensing, and import statements for core components to facilitate interaction with the ExifTool command-line application.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments, licensing information, version string, and import statements from internal modules (exceptions, exiftool, helper, experimental).",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, user inputs, network operations, or data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and sets up the namespace; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup module containing licensing comments, version information, and static import statements. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, well-documented nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard library setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
