  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup module for a Python library interfacing with ExifTool.\n- No evidence of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or any malicious patterns.\n- The code consists mainly of comments, licensing, versioning, and static imports.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The import statements are standard and do not pose security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- The license comments are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n- The version string is not sensitive.\n- The code does not contain any embedded or hidden code, nor does it perform any code execution beyond static imports.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Any discrepancies or questionable claims?**\n- No. All assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard library setup code with no malicious intent.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above. The code is safe and standard for an open-source Python library setup.",
