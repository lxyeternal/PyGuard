{
  "purpose": "Provide a Python library to interact with the ExifTool command-line application for metadata extraction from images.",
  "sources": "The code imports external modules (.exceptions, .exiftool, .helper, .experimental), and defines metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to library functions, but no untrusted input to critical functions is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code mainly contains licensing comments, documentation, and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a library setup with licensing information, documentation, and import statements. It does not execute any user input, network operations, or system modifications. The only potentially sensitive element is the import of modules, but these are standard and presumably safe. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. There are no backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard library module for interacting with ExifTool, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
