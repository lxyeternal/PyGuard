  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, experimental extension for media metadata processing. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond the normal considerations of subprocess invocation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the external command execution but justified by careful handling and standard practices."
