{
  "purpose": "The code manages subprocesses to run exiftool, handling command execution, output parsing, and process lifecycle with platform-specific safety measures. It does not contain malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to execute(), environment variables, system signals, and subprocess streams.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess command execution, stdin writing, stdout/stderr reading, and output parsing.",
  "flows": "Parameters are encoded and sent to subprocess; output is read via os.read() until sentinel sequences; output is decoded and stored.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of ctypes for prctl is standard for process safety, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard subprocess wrapper around exiftool, with process control, output parsing, and platform-specific safety features. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. Input validation is limited to type checks, which is typical for such wrappers. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure subprocess interface for exiftool, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard process management and platform safety measures.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
