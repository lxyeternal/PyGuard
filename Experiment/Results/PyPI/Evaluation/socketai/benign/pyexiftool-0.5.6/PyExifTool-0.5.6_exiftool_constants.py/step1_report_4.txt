  "purpose": "Defines constants and platform-specific configurations used by other modules in the PyExifTool package.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, environment variables (PATH), and internal constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; constants are derived from system information.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration constants based on the operating system and other environment parameters. It includes platform checks, executable naming, process startup flags, and default values for file handling. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. All variables are standard constants or derived from system properties, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup for platform-specific and process-related constants. It does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It serves as a straightforward foundation for other parts of the package.",
