  "purpose": "Defines platform-specific constants, executable names, process flags, and default parameters for the PyExifTool package, primarily for configuration and environment detection.",
  "sources": "sys.platform checks for platform detection",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed",
  "flows": "Platform detection influences executable name and process flags",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration",
  "analysis": "The code performs static platform detection using sys.platform, sets constants accordingly, and defines default parameters for process control and executable names. It contains no user input, external data processing, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The constants and logic are standard, well-documented, and serve configuration purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate a benign configuration module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration module for platform detection and constants, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
