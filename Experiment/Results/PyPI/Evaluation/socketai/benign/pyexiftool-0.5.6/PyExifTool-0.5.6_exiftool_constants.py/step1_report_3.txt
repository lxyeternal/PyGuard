{
  "purpose": "Defines constants used by other modules in the PyExifTool package, primarily for platform checks and process configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads the sys.platform value for platform detection.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "sys.platform is read and used to set constants based on the detected platform.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; all constants are straightforward and derived from system parameters or static values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to check the platform and sets constants accordingly, such as DEFAULT_EXECUTABLE based on the platform. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are processed. The constants for process management and defaults are static and well-documented. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for configuration and platform detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration/constants module for a Python package. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It simply sets platform-dependent constants and configuration values.",
