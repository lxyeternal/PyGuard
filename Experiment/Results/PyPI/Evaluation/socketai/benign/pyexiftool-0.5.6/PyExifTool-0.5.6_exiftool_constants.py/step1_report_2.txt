{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration settings used by the PyExifTool package, including platform detection, executable names, process control constants, and default parameters.",
  "sources": "sys.platform for platform detection, environment variables for executable search path (implied), no direct external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is primarily configuration and constant definitions without data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; all code appears standard and related to environment detection and configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to check the platform and sets constants accordingly, such as DEFAULT_EXECUTABLE. It defines platform-specific values, process control constants, and default parameters for reading data. All variables are straightforward and do not involve dynamic execution, user input, or external data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for configuration and constants, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard for a Python package setup.",
