  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward constants and configuration module.\n- It performs platform detection via `sys.platform`.\n- Sets platform-specific constants such as executable names and process flags.\n- Defines default parameters for the package.\n- No user input, external data processing, dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is benign; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- The constants are static, well-documented, and serve configuration purposes.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- None observed. The code is clear, standard, and free of security flaws.\n\n### Scores given to each issue:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- Risk scores are 0 or 1, with 1 only if the risk is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a high risk score; the code is purely configuration.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, malware score remains 0.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as configuration with no malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified, as the code is static.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely for platform detection and setting constants.\n- No external data, user input, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- The minimal risk is inherent to configuration files, which are inherently low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard configuration module for the PyExifTool package. It does not pose any security threat, nor does it contain malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores at 0 for malware and obfuscated.  \n- Maintain a risk score of 0.",
