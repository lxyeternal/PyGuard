{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and configure the packaging and distribution of the Python library 'PyExifTool'. It reads project metadata, handles package inclusion, and defines dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; the code only performs local file reading and package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading README.rst → Using get_long_desc() to process long description → Passing parameters to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. All code appears standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging modules, defines a function to read and process a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata and configuration. It does not execute external commands, handle user input, or process untrusted data. All operations are static and related solely to package setup. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It primarily reads local files and configures package metadata for distribution.",
