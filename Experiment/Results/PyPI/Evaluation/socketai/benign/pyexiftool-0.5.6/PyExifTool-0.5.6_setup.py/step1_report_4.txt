  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to define setup configurations for packaging and distributing the PyExifTool Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading README.rst file for long description",
    "Setup function parameters including package details, URLs, classifiers, and dependencies"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "Open file operation to read README.rst",
    "Regular expression substitution to modify README content"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Reading README.rst and processing its content before passing it as long_description",
    "Defining package metadata and dependencies via the setup() function"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code activities detected. The only dynamic operation is reading and processing a README file, which is standard. No external network connections, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file and removes specific sections via regex, then configures the package with metadata and dependencies. No input from untrusted sources, no network operations, or code that could be malicious. All operations are typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It adheres to common practices for Python packaging and contains no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
