  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the PyExifTool Python package, used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading the README.rst file for long description",
    "Configuration of package metadata and options",
    "Import statements for setuptools and re modules",
    "Function get_long_desc() that reads and processes the README file",
    "setup() function call with package details"

  "sinks": [
    "None apparent. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
    "No execution of external commands or system calls.",
    "No handling of user input or environment variables that influence security-sensitive actions."

  "flows": [
    "Reading and processing README.rst -> setting long_description parameter in setup()",
    "Configuration data flows from static code into setup() call parameters"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Commented-out distutils import; harmless and standard in setup scripts",
    "No hardcoded credentials, tokens, or secrets",
    "No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns",
    "No external network calls or code injection points"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It reads a README file, processes it with regex to remove specific sections, and then calls setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The functions and modules used are typical for packaging and do not perform any insecure or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no malicious intent. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any security risks or malicious code. The use of regex for cleaning the README is safe, and no external data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
