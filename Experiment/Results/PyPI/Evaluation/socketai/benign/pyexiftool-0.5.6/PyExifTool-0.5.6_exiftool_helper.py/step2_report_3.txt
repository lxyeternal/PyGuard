  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a wrapper for exiftool, validating inputs, managing process execution, and handling exceptions. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The malware score is 0, security risk is negligible (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs standard validation, exception handling, and process management. No signs of malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing input validation and process management. It notes that untrusted input could pose a security risk if passed directly to command execution, but validation is in place. Malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code performs validation and safe command construction. The potential risk from untrusted input is mitigated by validation, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is minimal, and the reasoning is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on input validation, process control, and the absence of malicious behaviors. It notes that the code is a standard helper library with proper validation and no signs of sabotage.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code validates tags, manages subprocesses, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score 0 is justified. The security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing input validation, process management, and the absence of malicious behaviors. The code is deemed legitimate and safe.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough. The regex validation, input handling, and subprocess control are standard and safe.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. The risk assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a helper for subprocess management with validation, no malicious behaviors, and safe practices.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's implementation. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns are evident.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code is primarily a wrapper with validation.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity or code suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — Slightly above zero, justified by the fact that it executes external commands, but with proper validation and no malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard, well-implemented helper class for managing exiftool subprocesses, with input validation and error handling. No evidence suggests any supply chain attack, malware, or malicious sabotage.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable. The code is benign, and the security posture is very low risk.",
