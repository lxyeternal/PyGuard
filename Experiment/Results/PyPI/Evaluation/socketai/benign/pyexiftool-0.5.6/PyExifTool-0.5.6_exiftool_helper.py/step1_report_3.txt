{
  "purpose": "Helper and wrapper extension for the ExifTool class to facilitate safer and easier metadata extraction and modification of media files.",
  "sources": "Input files via function parameters (files argument), input tags via function parameters, environment variables are not used, data read from files passed to methods, internal regex validation of tag names.",
  "sinks": "Execution of exiftool commands via execute() method, potentially sending data to subprocesses; tag validation functions that could block malicious tags, but no direct data leaks or system access is observed.",
  "flows": "Input files/tags -> validation (if enabled) -> command parameter construction -> execute() call to run exiftool process. No untrusted data flows into external systems other than exiftool subprocess execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard parameter validation, command construction, and process control. Regex validation is basic and not overly complex. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard wrapper for exiftool, providing additional validation and convenience methods. It manages subprocess execution, checks tag name validity, and handles file inputs. No malicious behavior, no system disruption, or privacy violations are evident. Security measures include input validation and controlled command execution. No signs of sabotage or malware components are present. No suspicious external calls or hidden behaviors identified. The regex for tag validation is simple and appropriate for its purpose. Overall, the code adheres to best practices for a helper library, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured helper module for managing exiftool commands safely. It includes input validation, process management, and error handling. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. Its security risk is negligible, and the likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
