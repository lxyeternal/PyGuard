  "purpose": "A wrapper/helper class for exiftool, managing subprocess execution, input validation, and exception handling to facilitate safe interaction with exiftool commands.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for commands, such as file names, tags, and command options; data read from user inputs and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "External exiftool subprocess execution, command-line argument construction, and subprocess output handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and converted to strings, then assembled into command arguments, which are passed to the subprocess execution methods; outputs are captured and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; regex validation for tags is straightforward; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for filenames and tags, manages subprocess execution with error handling, and ensures parameters are safely converted to strings before execution. Regex validation for tags is simple and appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is minimal, mainly dependent on upstream validation of inputs, which the code encourages but does not enforce beyond basic regex checks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured helper class for interacting with exiftool, with proper validation and process management. There are no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security posture is very low risk, and the scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior.",
