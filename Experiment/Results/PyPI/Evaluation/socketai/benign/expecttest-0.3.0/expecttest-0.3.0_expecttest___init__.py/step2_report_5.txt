  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a test utility that manages expectations, modifies source files based on test outcomes, controlled via environment variables. It uses AST and file I/O to replace string literals in source code, with safety checks and backup creation.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malicious behavior detected. The only concern is the ability to overwrite source files, which is a known pattern in test frameworks but could be misused.\n\n- **Assessment:** The logic is consistent, safe in context, and designed for test maintenance. No obfuscation or malware signs.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 (moderate, due to source modification capability).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions for string manipulation, source code editing, and test expectations. It highlights the potential for source code modification when accepting new outputs, but finds no malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malware or backdoors. The source code modification feature is intended for test convenience, not malicious purposes.\n\n- **Assessment:** Well within expected patterns for test frameworks. No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions for string assertions and source code modifications, controlled via environment variables. It emphasizes the safety and purpose of source code rewriting for test expectations.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malware or backdoors. The source modification is a known testing pattern.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and safe in context. No obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the utility functions, especially the ability to update source code during tests via environment variables. It recognizes the potential risks but sees no malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malicious behavior. The source modification feature could be misused but is intended for test updates.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns; standard testing utility.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, source code manipulation for test expectations, controlled via environment variables. No malicious behavior or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malware. Source modification is a known pattern.\n\n- **Assessment:** Safe, designed for test maintenance.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on **0**. The code is a test utility with no malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All indicate **0**; the code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher due to source modification capabilities, but this is a known pattern in testing frameworks. The consensus is around **0.2**, which is moderate but not severe.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — due to source code rewriting features, but within expected testing utility scope.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate testing utility for managing source code expectations, with the ability to modify source files based on test outcomes when enabled via environment variables. No evidence suggests malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The potential for source modification is a known and controlled feature, not a security flaw.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2",
