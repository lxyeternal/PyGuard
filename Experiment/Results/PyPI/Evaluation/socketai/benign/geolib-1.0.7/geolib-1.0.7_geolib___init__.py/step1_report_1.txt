  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a generic utility or module, but without specific context or comments, its exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from the 'input_data' variable and potentially from environment variables via os.environ (if used).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any operations that write to files, network, or execute system commands; however, none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables or environment variables through processing functions to output or system actions, but explicit flow details are limited due to the lack of complete code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code constructs are observed. No obfuscated code features or dynamic execution are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal or incomplete, making comprehensive analysis challenging. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are apparent. The absence of complex logic, obfuscation, or external data sources suggests low risk. However, the lack of context prevents definitive conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious logic detected.",
