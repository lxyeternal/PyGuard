{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for geohash encoding, decoding, adjacency, and neighbor calculations, used for spatial data representation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as latitude, longitude, geohash strings, and direction indicators.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or system interactions; computations are internal.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding/decoding functions to produce geohash strings or coordinate bounds; adjacency functions process geohash strings to find neighbors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geohash algorithms with proper validation and no external or malicious behavior. It uses well-known libraries and straightforward logic. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Input validation is adequate, and no external system calls are made. The implementation aligns with common geohash practices, and the code is transparent and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of geohash functions with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain obfuscation or sabotage mechanisms. The supply chain security risk is negligible.",
