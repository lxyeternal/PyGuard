{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for encoding, decoding, and navigating geohashes, which are spatial encoding tools used for geolocation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters such as geohash strings, latitude and longitude values, and direction strings.",
  "sinks": "Returns geohash strings and coordinate bounds; no sinks for untrusted data processing or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (coordinates and geohash strings) are processed to produce geohash strings or neighboring geohashes; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors; functions follow standard geohash algorithms. Usage of decimal and math libraries for precise calculations is typical. No suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements geohash encoding, decoding, and neighbor calculations using standard mathematical procedures and data structures. No signs of malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The code uses standard Python libraries and well-structured logic for geospatial calculations. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The functions are self-contained and do not interact with the system or external systems beyond computational tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of geohash algorithms with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It appears to be a legitimate, purpose-specific library for geospatial encoding and neighbor calculation, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
