{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to encode and decode geohashes, and to find adjacent and neighboring geohash cells for spatial indexing and location approximation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from parameters such as geohash strings, latitude, longitude, and direction arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or code execution. No external output or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (geohash, lat, lon, direction) are processed within functions to compute bounds, neighbors, and encodings. There are no flows that lead to untrusted data being executed or sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of geohash algorithms with proper error handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. All logic is consistent with spatial encoding/decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code implements geohash encoding, decoding, boundary calculations, and neighbor identification purely for spatial computations. Usage of standard Python libraries and controlled data flows indicate benign functionality. No suspicious dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious payloads are detected. The code does not include any functions or behaviors that could be used maliciously, such as data exfiltration or remote command execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-documented implementation of geohash algorithms with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not contain malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
