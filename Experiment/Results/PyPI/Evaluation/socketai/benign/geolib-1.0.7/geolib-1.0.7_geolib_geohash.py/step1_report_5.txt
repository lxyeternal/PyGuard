{
  "purpose": "Provide functions for encoding, decoding, and finding neighboring geohashes for geospatial data.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: geohash strings, latitude, longitude, and direction strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data into system effects. No network, file, or system commands present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through boundary calculations and string manipulations, with no dangerous data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets. The code performs standard geohash computations with typical mathematical operations and string handling. No obfuscated code features are present. The only potential concern is the absence of validation for input ranges or types, but these are typical for such functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geohash encoding/decoding and neighbor functions using known algorithms. It reads data only from function inputs, processes with mathematical and string operations, and outputs geohash strings or coordinate bounds. No network, system commands, or data exfiltration methods are present. The code appears straightforward and uses common libraries for mathematical calculations. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior were detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard implementation of geohash functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use and contains no malware or security risks beyond normal computational operations.",
