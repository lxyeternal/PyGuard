{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'geolib' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "File reading for 'README.md'; static dependency lists; setuptools.setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no external data inputs or outputs are handled at runtime",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content (source) used in package description (sink); static dependencies loaded into setup (no flow from untrusted sources)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code is standard setup script with no obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads a markdown README file for long description, defines dependencies, and configures setup parameters. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input. The dependencies are standard and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code strictly adheres to conventional Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for package distribution.",
