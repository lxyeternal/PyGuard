{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'geolib' Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; defining dependencies in 'requires' and 'test_requirements'; no user input or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external outputs; setup configuration does not process untrusted input or perform network/file operations beyond standard setup.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; the code primarily prepares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code adheres to standard Python package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', reads a local 'README.md' for the long description, defines required packages for normal and testing purposes, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All actions are typical for a Python package setup script. There are no code injection points, external data handling beyond reading a local file, or suspicious behavior. The dependencies are standard, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or security-risk behavior. It only performs package configuration tasks with local file reading and dependency declarations. No security concerns are identified.",
