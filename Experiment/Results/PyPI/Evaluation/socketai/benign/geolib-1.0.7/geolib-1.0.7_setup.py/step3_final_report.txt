  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'geolib' library, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines dependencies 'future' and 'pytest'; calls setuptools.setup() with package info.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> sets dependencies -> executes setup() with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in 'tests_require' parameter (should be 'tests_require') but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It reads a local file, defines dependencies, and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious code structures are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The only issue is the minor typo in 'tests_require', which does not impact security but should be corrected for proper functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. The only recommended change is fixing the 'tests_require' parameter name. Overall, the supply chain security posture is excellent.",
