{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'geolib' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining dependency lists; calling setuptools.setup() to initialize package setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only sets up package metadata and dependencies, with no execution of untrusted code or data.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> defining dependencies -> executing setup() with package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, no code execution, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for long description, defines dependencies, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and requirements. All elements are standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated behavior, or malicious data handling. The dependencies are benign ('future', 'pytest'), and no code execution or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to configure package installation parameters.",
