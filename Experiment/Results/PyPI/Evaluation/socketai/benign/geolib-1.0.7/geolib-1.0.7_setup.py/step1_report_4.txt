{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'geolib' that provides geohash encoding, decoding, and related functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description; no other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data; the script primarily calls setup functions and reads a static file.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading a static markdown file for description and passing package configuration to setuptools.setup(), with no untrusted data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and reads a README file for long description, then defines dependencies and package metadata before calling setuptools.setup() to prepare the package. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior observed. The dependencies are standard, and the setup parameters appear normal for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles package configuration and distribution setup.",
