{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and author information header, likely part of a larger Python module or script.",
  "sources": "The source reads metadata such as author, license, and copyright information at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only license and author comments; no suspicious or unusual code or behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of comment blocks and module-level metadata such as author, license, and copyright information. There are no executable statements, no data processing, no input/output operations, or third-party library usage. As a result, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's purpose appears to be documentation and licensing only.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, non-executable license header with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides author and licensing information typical for open-source projects.",
