  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.getcwd(), time.strftime()), importing minimalmodbus library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions affecting data security or system integrity.",
  "flows": "No dangerous data flow from sources to sinks. The code mainly imports modules, sets paths, and configures documentation settings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The code performs standard setup for documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up paths, imports minimalmodbus, and configures Sphinx documentation parameters. No user input handling, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is present. The import of minimalmodbus is static and does not involve dynamic code execution or potentially malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious functions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard documentation build configuration script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs environment setup and configuration tasks typical for a Python project.",
