  "purpose": "Create a spinner animation in a separate thread to indicate progress or activity.",
  "sources": "Importing threading, time, and Spinner; creating TimerThread class; initializing spinner inside run method.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Thread's run method executes spinner.next() every second in an infinite loop.",
  "anomalies": "Infinite loop without exit condition; no apparent malicious behavior, but design may cause resource exhaustion if used improperly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a thread class that runs an infinite loop, updating a spinner animation every second. It uses a third-party Spinner class, likely for visual feedback. There are no signs of data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or malicious actions. The infinite loop could cause high CPU or resource consumption if not managed carefully, but this is a typical pattern for progress indicators. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a non-malicious, standard progress spinner in a separate thread. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident, but improper use could lead to resource issues.",
