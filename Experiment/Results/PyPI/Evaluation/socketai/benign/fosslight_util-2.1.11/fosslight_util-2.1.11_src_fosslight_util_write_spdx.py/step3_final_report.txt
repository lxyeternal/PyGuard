  "purpose": "Generate SPDX license documents from scan data, including packages, files, licenses, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "scan_item.cover.get_print_json(), file_item.source_name_or_path, oss_item.license, oss_item.copyright, oss_item.download_location, file_item.purl, file_item.depends_on",
  "sinks": "write_file(), validate_full_spdx_document()",
  "flows": "scan_item.cover.get_print_json() -> license parsing; file_item.source_name_or_path -> checksum calculation; oss_item.license -> SPDX license normalization; oss_item.download_location -> package info; file_item.purl and depends_on -> dependency relationships",
  "anomalies": "Broad try-except blocks that may mask errors; no hardcoded credentials or network activity; license parsing exceptions handled broadly",
  "analysis": "The code constructs SPDX documents by processing scan data, handling license normalization, checksum calculation, and dependency relationships. It uses external SPDX libraries for validation and writing. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling is broad but standard for such tools. License conversions and checksum computations are routine. The code's structure and behavior align with legitimate license documentation utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SPDX document generator with no malicious intent or behavior. It performs standard license and dependency processing, with no signs of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
