  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SPDX document generator with no malicious intent or behavior. It performs standard license and dependency processing, with no signs of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
