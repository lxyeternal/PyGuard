  "purpose": "The script generates SPDX documents from scan data, including package and license information, and writes the SPDX data to a file.",
  "sources": "Reads scan_item data, file paths, license info, and environment via imported modules and local variables.",
  "sinks": "Writes SPDX document files, logs information, and processes license strings.",
  "flows": "Input data from scan_item and file items flows into SPDX document creation and is then written to a file; license data is processed and formatted before inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code relies on external libraries with standard functionality; no obfuscated code or unusual language features are evident. Error handling is generic, but no malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs SPDX document generation, involving reading scan data, calculating checksums, and formatting license and package info. It handles license conversions and validations, and writes output SPDX files. The usage of external SPDX libraries appears legitimate, and the license conversion functions are standard. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity are present. The error handling is generic, but there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SPDX document generator with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It processes scan data securely and writes SPDX files without suspicious activities. The risk of malware or security issues appears very low.",
