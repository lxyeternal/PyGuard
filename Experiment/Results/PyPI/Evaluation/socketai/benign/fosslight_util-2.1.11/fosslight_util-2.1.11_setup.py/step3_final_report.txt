  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'fosslight_util', configuring metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files for package description and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static files into variables, then passes data to 'setup()' for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script utilizing 'setuptools' to configure package metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points. It reads static files for description and dependencies, with conditional dependencies based on Python version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data flows. The use of 'codecs.open' is standard, and no dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
