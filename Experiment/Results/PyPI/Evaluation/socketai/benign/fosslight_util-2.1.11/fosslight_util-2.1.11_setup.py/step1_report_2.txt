{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'fosslight_util', defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and package data files.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data flows to external systems or untrusted destinations in this script.",
  "flows": "Reading files to gather package information, then passing data to 'setup()' without further data manipulation or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The script strictly performs package setup tasks. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures using 'setuptools'. It reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') to populate package metadata and dependencies. It defines entry points for console scripts. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code injections. The use of 'open' from 'codecs' is for reading files, a common practice. No suspicious logic, obfuscated code, or external data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely defines package configuration and dependencies, with no malicious behaviors detected.",
