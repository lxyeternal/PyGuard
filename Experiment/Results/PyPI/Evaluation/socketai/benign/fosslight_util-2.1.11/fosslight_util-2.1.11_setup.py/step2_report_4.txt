  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Python setup script, performing typical tasks like reading README and requirements files, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no signs of code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Anomalies**:  \n   All reports agree that no suspicious or malicious patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or external network activity are detected. The use of 'codecs.open' and conditional dependencies are standard practices.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since no obfuscation is detected.  \n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.  \n   - **Security risk score**: Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1. Given the code's nature, this is reasonable; setup scripts are generally low risk, but some might assign a minimal risk score due to the potential for malicious setup scripts. However, in this case, the code is clean.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:  \n   - No claims are based on assumptions; all observations are factual and consistent.  \n   - The dependency on 'pygit2' with conditional requirements is standard and does not introduce risk.\n\n5. **Overall assessment**:  \n   The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security flaws. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score**: **0** (the script is a standard setup file with minimal risk)\n\n### Final note:\nThis setup script is typical, well-structured, and free of security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
