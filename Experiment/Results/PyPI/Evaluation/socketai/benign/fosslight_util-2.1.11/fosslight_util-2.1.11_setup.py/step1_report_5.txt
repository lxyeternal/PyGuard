{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'fosslight_util'. It prepares the package for distribution, specifying dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files to load long description and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Reads files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt') and uses their content in package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and reads package metadata files. It then invokes 'setup()' with package information, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic code evaluation occurs. The file's purpose is to configure package distribution; it does not contain or execute malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical build/configuration code for a Python project.",
