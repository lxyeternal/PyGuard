{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package 'fosslight_util', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files, as well as package data files within 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data directly influences execution or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads files containing potential configuration or dependencies, then uses setuptools to package the code. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are observed. The script performs standard packaging functions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and uses them for packaging a Python project. It reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' for package description and dependencies, respectively. It sets up package information including metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious code flows. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no anomalies or indicators of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. The code performs typical packaging functions and does not include any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
