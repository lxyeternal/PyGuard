  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'fosslight_util', configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external network or system modifications are performed in this code.",
  "flows": "Reads package documentation and requirements files during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly follows standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading README and requirements files, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All operations are standard for Python package distribution. No code injections, external network communications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The 'pygit2' dependency is conditionally included based on Python version, which is a common practice. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It adheres to standard practices without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
