  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report states the code is a typical setup script with no malicious activity, no suspicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code analysis. The code is standard and safe.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes standard setup procedures, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk is set at 0.1, which is very low, indicating minimal concern. Given the code's nature, this seems reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code content.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard packaging code, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Matches the code's nature.\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; scores are 0.0.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation in Report 2 (0.1), which is reasonable given the minimal risk associated with a standard setup script.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs standard package setup operations, reading static files, and configuring package metadata.\n- No suspicious behaviors, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (or possibly 0.1 for conservative caution, but 0.0 is justified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are accurate and justified based on the code and reports. No further action or score adjustments are needed.",
