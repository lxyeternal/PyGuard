  "flows": "Reads data from files, uses the data to configure package installation, and sets up entry points for command-line scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads external files for description and requirements, and configures package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It uses conditional extras based on Python version, which is a common practice. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
