  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate dependency downloader/extractor with no active malicious behavior. However, unvalidated inputs, especially URLs used in subprocess calls, could be exploited for command injection. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk score should be around 0.35 to reflect the potential vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the code analysis."
