{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to scan a directory tree and exclude files and directories matching specific patterns, returning a list of excluded paths.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'patterns' list parameter and the 'path_to_scan' directory argument; 'os.walk' reads filesystem data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted input in a manner that could lead to security vulnerabilities such as code injection or data leaks. No sensitive data is sent over the network or written insecurely.",
  "flows": "Patterns are processed and used to match directory and file names during traversal; matched paths are added to 'excluded_paths'.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Pattern normalization and directory traversal logic are standard. No obfuscation or hidden behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script normalizes input patterns, traverses directories, and matches directories and files against these patterns to exclude them from a result list. It uses 'fnmatch' for pattern matching and performs directory pruning to optimize traversal. The code appears to be a utility function for filtering filesystem paths based on patterns, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard directory scanning utility for excluding paths based on patterns. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The code’s purpose and operations are transparent and safe.",
