{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to traverse a directory tree and exclude files and directories matching specified patterns, returning a list of excluded paths.",
  "sources": "User-provided list of patterns, directory structure during os.walk",
  "sinks": "Adding file and directory paths to the 'excluded_paths' set; no other data sinks present",
  "flows": "Patterns are used to match directory and file names, and matching paths are added to excluded_paths",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Pattern normalization and directory traversal are standard. No suspicious network or system calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The script normalizes input patterns and performs directory traversal, matching patterns against directory and file names. Matching directories have their entire subtree added to the exclusion list. Files matching patterns are added individually. No code injection, data leaks, or external communications are present. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and intended for filtering files based on patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for excluding files/directories based on patterns. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
