  "purpose": "A directory traversal utility that normalizes exclusion patterns, matches directory and file names against these patterns, and returns a sorted list of paths to exclude.",
  "sources": "Pattern list provided as input, filesystem directory and file names during os.walk traversal",
  "sinks": "Excluded paths added to the set; no untrusted data sinks or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Patterns are normalized, then directory and file names are matched against patterns; matching paths are added to excluded_paths",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward pattern matching and directory pruning without obfuscation or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code normalizes patterns by replacing backslashes and stripping trailing slashes or '/*'. It then walks the directory tree, matching directory names and relative paths against patterns. When a match occurs, it adds all files under that directory to the exclusion set and prunes the directory from further traversal. File matching is performed similarly. The logic is standard, with no external network calls, code injection, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The code is a benign utility for pattern-based filesystem filtering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward directory exclusion utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. The code does not perform any harmful actions, external communications, or contain obfuscation. The scores should reflect its benign and transparent design.",
