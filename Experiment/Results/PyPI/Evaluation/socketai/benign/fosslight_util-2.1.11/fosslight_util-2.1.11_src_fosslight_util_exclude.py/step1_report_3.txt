{
  "purpose": "This code scans a directory and its subdirectories to exclude files and folders matching specified patterns, returning a list of excluded paths.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'patterns' list input, and the directory structure via os.walk on 'path_to_scan'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; only filesystem traversal and path collection.",
  "flows": "Input patterns influence which directories/files are excluded, but no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations like network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code normalizes user-provided patterns and uses them to match directory and file names during os.walk traversal. When a directory matches, all its files are added to the exclusion list, and the directory is pruned from further traversal. Similarly, files matching the patterns are added to the list. The pattern normalization and matching logic seem standard. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The code solely operates on the filesystem to exclude paths based on patterns, with no external communications or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a directory and file exclusion utility based on pattern matching. It performs standard filesystem operations without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
