{
  "purpose": "This code defines a function to exclude files and directories based on specified patterns during a filesystem traversal.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'patterns' (list of string patterns), 'path_to_scan' (directory path).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data outputs are evident; the function operates solely on filesystem data.",
  "flows": "The code reads filesystem directory and file names; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; patterns are used for matching.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Pattern normalization appears standard. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script normalizes input patterns, traverses directories, matches directory and file names against these patterns, and excludes matching files by adding them to 'excluded_paths'. Directory exclusions trigger a walk to include all nested files. No code injection, network activity, or system manipulation is observed. No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code appears as a utility for pattern-based file exclusion, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for excluding files and directories based on patterns. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It functions as a filesystem filter with no security risks identified.",
