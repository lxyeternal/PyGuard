  "purpose": "Utility for comparing two lists of FileItem objects, merging and identifying differences based on name, version, and license attributes.",
  "sources": "In-memory JSON representations extracted from FileItem objects via get_print_json() method.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processing occurs entirely within memory, with no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from FileItem.get_print_json() to merging and comparison functions, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Potential bug in get_merged_item: oi_license is a string, but extend() expects an iterable; may cause runtime error if oi_license is not a list.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data comparison for dependency/license management, with straightforward logic and no suspicious constructs. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The only concern is a possible runtime error due to license extension logic, but this does not impact security. All reports correctly assess the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is benign, and no external or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, transparent utility for dependency comparison with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
