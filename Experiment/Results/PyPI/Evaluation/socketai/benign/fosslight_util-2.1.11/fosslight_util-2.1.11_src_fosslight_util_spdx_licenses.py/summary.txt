  "conclusion": "The script is a benign license data collector and processor with no malicious intent or behavior. The external URL fetches are from trusted sources and do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score of 0.2 is justified due to external data fetching without validation but is acceptable in this context."
