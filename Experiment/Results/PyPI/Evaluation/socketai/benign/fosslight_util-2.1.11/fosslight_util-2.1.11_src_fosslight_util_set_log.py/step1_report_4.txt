  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed",
    "Use of external library 'lastversion' for version checking, which is not suspicious",
    "Logging configurations appear standard, no obfuscation or misleading code",
    "Conditional OS detection logic is straightforward",
    "Potential verbose debug logging in exception handlers, which could expose internal errors if logs are accessible",
    "No network calls other than 'lastversion.has_update' which checks remote repo, but this is legitimate functionality"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging, checks for package updates, and detects OS version. It uses standard Python libraries and common patterns for logging and system info retrieval. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The external 'lastversion' library is used properly for update checks. Exception handling is minimal but does not perform any malicious actions. All operations are typical for a system utility or developer tool, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code intended for version management, OS detection, and logging setup. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It performs normal operations typical for a software tool and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
