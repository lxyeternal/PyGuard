  "purpose": "Initialize logging (console and optional file), check for package updates via lastversion, retrieve OS info, and log relevant details.",
  "sources": "Arguments to functions, environment info via platform and sys modules, external package lastversion for update check",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, exception messages (debug logs), potential info in log files if created",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> logging setup -> version check -> environment info retrieval -> logging outputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup routines for logging, version checking, and environment info gathering. It uses legitimate external libraries (lastversion, coloredlogs). Exception handling is minimal and appropriate. No network activity beyond the benign version check, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, which is benign and typical for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for logging and environment info with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious intent. The scores in the reports are justified and accurate.",
