  "purpose": "This code provides functionality for generating and merging reports related to open-source scanning, including writing CSV and Excel files, handling headers, and processing scan results.",
  "sources": "Reads data from scan_item.get_print_array(), scan_item.cover.get_print_json(), external sheets, input directory files, and file names for merging.",
  "sinks": "Writes to CSV files, Excel workbooks, and sheets; creates and merges files in specified directories.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from scan_item methods and directory scans to file output functions; header data flows from get_header_row to file writers; merged data flows from multiple source files into combined reports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets detected. Usage of time.time() for sheet naming could be misused to obscure data, but is typical for dynamic sheet names. No obfuscated code patterns are present. The code handles external file merging and report generation in a standard manner. No hidden network activity or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly focuses on report generation from scan data, using standard Python libraries (xlsxwriter, csv, pandas). It reads data from scan_item objects and external files, then writes formatted reports. It merges multiple Excel files and handles headers dynamically, with no indication of malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, with exception handling that logs errors but does not perform unsafe actions. No suspicious code paths, credential handling, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard report generation utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. Its structure and logic are consistent with legitimate report processing functions. Overall, the risk of malicious activity is very low.",
