  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a report generation utility, reading data from scan_item objects, external files, and writing CSV/Excel reports.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic.\n- Exception handling is broad but standard.\n- Uses common libraries (pandas, xlsxwriter, jsonmerge).\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with code; reads from scan_item, filesystem.\n- **Sinks:** Writes CSV/Excel files.\n- **Flows:** Data flows are straightforward; no network or external command execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate report generation utility, low security risk.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, as per report, justified)\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1; emphasizes standard data processing, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (justified)\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Focuses on merging Excel files; no suspicious code.\n- Uses `time.time()` for sheet naming, which is normal for dynamic naming.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Describes report creation, header handling, and merging.\n- No suspicious patterns; uses standard libraries.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (justified)\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Similar in scope; no suspicious behavior.\n- File I/O and data handling are standard.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Scores & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### **Additional Comments:**\n- The code does not contain any hidden or malicious logic.\n- No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation.\n- The use of broad exception handling is standard for such scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The code is consistent with legitimate report processing functions.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese scores are aligned with the detailed review and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:** No changes are necessary; the current scores are appropriate given the code and reports.",
