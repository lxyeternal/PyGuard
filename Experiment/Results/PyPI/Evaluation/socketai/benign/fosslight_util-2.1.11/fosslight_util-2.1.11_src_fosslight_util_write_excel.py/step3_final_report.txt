  "purpose": "Generate CSV and Excel reports from scan data, merge reports, create cover sheets, handle headers, and process multiple sheets.",
  "sources": "scan_item.get_print_array(), scan_item.cover.get_print_json(), external sheets, filesystem files",
  "sinks": "Writes CSV and Excel files, merges Excel files, creates sheets, hides columns",
  "flows": "Data flows from scan_item and external sources to file outputs; no network or dynamic code execution involved",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; broad exception handling present but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward report generation utility, utilizing standard libraries (csv, pandas, xlsxwriter, jsonmerge). It reads data from scan_item objects and filesystem, then outputs reports. No network activity, code injection, or credential handling is present. The use of time.time() for sheet naming is common and not suspicious. Exception handling is broad but typical for such scripts. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and low security risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured report generator with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 accurately reflect its benign and standard functionality.",
