{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates applying and tracking image transformations using TorchIO, including visualization and inversion of transforms.",
  "sources": "Data loaded from TorchIO datasets and transformations applied during dataset creation and batch processing.",
  "sinks": "Transformation history stored within data objects; no external data leaks or untrusted sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input images -> apply transformations -> store history -> visualize and invert transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard TorchIO functions for medical image processing, including transformation composition, history tracking, and visualization. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The transformation history is used solely for visualization and inversion purposes. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The only minor concern is the security risk score assigned in some reports, but given the benign nature, it should be set to zero or near-zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign example of using TorchIO for medical image transformation tracking and visualization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the safe and standard nature of the code.",
