{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to apply and track image transformations using TorchIO for neuroimaging data, including visualization of transformed images and their transformation history.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the dataset loaded from TorchIO's FPG dataset and the batch loader.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could leak data or cause unintended effects; the code only visualizes data and prints transformation histories.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the dataset into transformations, which modify the images; the transformation history is stored and retrieved for analysis; images are visualized with titles indicating applied transforms.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script sets a seed for reproducibility, constructs a dataset with a sequence of transformations, and loads data in batches while tracking transformation history. It visualizes the transformed images with their histories. The code primarily relies on TorchIO's functions and standard Python libraries for data handling and plotting. There are no signs of hidden malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities. The focus is on data transformation and visualization, with proper usage of functions and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation for applying, tracking, and visualizing data transformations in neuroimaging workflows. It does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
