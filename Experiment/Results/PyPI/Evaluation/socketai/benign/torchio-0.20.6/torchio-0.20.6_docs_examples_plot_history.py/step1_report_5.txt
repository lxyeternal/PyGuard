{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates how to apply and track image transformations during training using TorchIO, including saving and inverting transform history.",
  "sources": "Imports of torchio library, dataset creation, and transformation functions. Data read from TorchIO dataset objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network communication or file writing are present. No sensitive data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Transform functions process dataset images, storing transformation history; then history is retrieved and inverted. No untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is standard for medical image processing with TorchIO.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes random seed, loads a dataset, applies a series of transformations, and tracks their history. It prints transformation history, attempts to invert transformations, and visualizes images with their transformation labels. The library functions used are standard for image processing, with no signs of malicious or suspicious code. There are no network operations, file writing, or external system interactions that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of transformation tracking in TorchIO for medical imaging. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It purely demonstrates usage of TorchIO functions for data augmentation and visualization.",
