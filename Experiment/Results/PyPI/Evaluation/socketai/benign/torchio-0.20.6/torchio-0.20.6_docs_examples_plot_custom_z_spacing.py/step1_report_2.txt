{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom image preprocessing transformation that resamples medical images along a specific axis, then applies a sequence of transformations to an example image dataset.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from 'tio.datasets.FPG().t1', which loads a medical imaging dataset.",
  "sinks": "The code performs in-memory image processing and plotting; no data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Dataset is loaded -> custom ResampleZ transformation is instantiated and applied -> transformed image is stored -> plotting function displays the result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no suspicious data handling or malicious commands detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary libraries, defines a simple custom class for resampling a specific axis, and applies this transformation to a medical image dataset. The code uses standard library functions and well-known packages (torchio, torch). There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The only potential concern is that the code manipulates medical imaging data but does so in a benign, straightforward manner aligned with normal image preprocessing tasks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard medical image preprocessing without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and appears to be intended for normal use within medical imaging workflows.",
