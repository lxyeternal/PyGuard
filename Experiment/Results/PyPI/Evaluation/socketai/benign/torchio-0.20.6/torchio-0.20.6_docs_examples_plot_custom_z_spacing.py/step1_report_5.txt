{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom image resampling transformation for medical imaging data and applies it to an example dataset.",
  "sources": "Imports torch, torchio, and a dataset from torchio.datasets.FPG().t1",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network or file system outputs besides plotting, which is standard visualization",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset load (FPG().t1) through custom transformation (ResampleZ) and subsequent plotting",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; no obfuscated code or hidden functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, defines a straightforward custom transformation class, applies transformations to a dataset image, and plots the result. All operations are typical for medical imaging preprocessing. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard image resampling with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign example of customizing data preprocessing in a medical imaging pipeline.",
