{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom resampling class for medical images, resampling only along the z-axis.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset image (`tio.datasets.FPG().t1`), applying transformations (`ToCanonical()`, `ResampleZ`) and plotting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input image -> transformations (including ResampleZ) -> transformed image -> plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard medical image preprocessing using TorchIO. It defines a straightforward class for resampling along one axis, applies it to a sample dataset, and visualizes the result. No malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical usage patterns. The security assessment indicates no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for standard image preprocessing in medical imaging workflows. All signals point to a safe, straightforward implementation with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
