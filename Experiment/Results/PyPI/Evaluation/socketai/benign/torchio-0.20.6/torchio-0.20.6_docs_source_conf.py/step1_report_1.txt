{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder for the TorchIO project, defining extensions, paths, themes, and output formats.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and datetime; accesses torchio.__version__; reads configuration parameters for Sphinx extensions and output options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data outputs or network connections; no eval, exec, or similar functions used.",
  "flows": "N/A - Configuration file with static data and imports only; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code mainly sets up static configuration variables.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a package (torchio) to extract version info. It defines configuration options for various output formats and extensions, specifying paths, themes, and gallery options. No code executes external commands, handles user input, or performs network operations. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration file without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply sets up documentation build parameters for the TorchIO project. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
