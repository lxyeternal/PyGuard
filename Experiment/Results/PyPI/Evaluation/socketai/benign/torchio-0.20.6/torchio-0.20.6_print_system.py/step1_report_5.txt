{
  "purpose": "The code imports several scientific and medical imaging libraries and prints version information for the runtime environment and these libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from the sitk.Version() call and sys.version; imports libraries without processing user input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is written to network, files, or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or outputs; version information is retrieved locally and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The version extraction with regex is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers environment information and library versions. It uses standard library functions and imports widely used open-source packages without performing any actions that could be malicious. No user input, network communication, or file operations that could be exploited are present. The only potential concern might be version extraction from sitk.Version(), but this is a benign read operation. Overall, the code appears to be intended for environment diagnostics or logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment information script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any network, file, or sensitive operations. Overall, it is safe.",
