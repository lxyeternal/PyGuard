{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather and print environment and library version information related to the system and specific scientific Python packages.",
  "sources": "Reads data from system modules (platform, sys), version info from imported libraries (SimpleITK, torchio, torch, numpy).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted input or data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, and no dynamic execution or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several libraries related to medical imaging and scientific computing, retrieves their version information, and prints system environment details. It uses regex to parse the SimpleITK version string, which is standard. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data exfiltration, no malicious logic, and no obfuscation or backdoors. The code’s purpose appears to be environment setup or verification, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to display environment and library versions. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
