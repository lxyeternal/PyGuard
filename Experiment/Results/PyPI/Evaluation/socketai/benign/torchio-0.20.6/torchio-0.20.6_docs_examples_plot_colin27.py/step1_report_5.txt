{
  "purpose": "To load and plot a medical imaging dataset (Colin27) using the TorchIO library.",
  "sources": "The code imports the TorchIO library and accesses a dataset (Colin27) via torchio.datasets.Colin27().",
  "sinks": "The code calls the plot() method on the dataset object, which may display images but does not send or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Dataset is loaded from the torchio.datasets module (source). The plot() method visualizes the data locally (sink). No data flows to external entities or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the TorchIO library, loads the Colin27 dataset, and plots it using the built-in plot method. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network communications, or data exfiltration routines. The code performs a benign action—visualizing a known dataset—without any malicious behavior or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script that loads and visualizes a medical imaging dataset without any malicious intent. It poses no security threat.",
