  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The use of include/exclude parameters is appropriate and does not introduce vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0), consistent with the benign nature of the code."
