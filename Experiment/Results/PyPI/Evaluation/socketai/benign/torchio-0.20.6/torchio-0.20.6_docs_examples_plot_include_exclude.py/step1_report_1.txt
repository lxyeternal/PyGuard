  "purpose": "The code demonstrates applying selective transformations to medical imaging data within a subject dataset using the TorchIO library.",
  "sources": "torch.manual_seed(0), tio.datasets.Pediatric(years=(4.5, 8.5))",
  "sinks": "transform(subject), transformed.plot()",
  "flows": "Initialization of seed and dataset -> application of transformations to dataset -> plotting of original and transformed data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; usage of include/exclude parameters in transformations is standard for selective data augmentation",
  "analysis": "The code sets a manual seed for reproducibility, loads a pediatric dataset, and plots it. It then constructs a composed transformation with affine and blur operations, selectively applying them to specific image types ('t1' and 't2') using include/exclude options. The transformed dataset is then plotted. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The use of standard libraries and functions suggests a typical data processing script without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate example of applying selective data augmentation to medical images using TorchIO. There are no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks. The script is safe and intended for image preprocessing.",
