  "purpose": "Demonstrates how to use include and exclude parameters in TorchIO transformations to selectively apply augmentations to specific images within a medical imaging dataset.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading (`tio.datasets.Pediatric`), transformation parameters (`include`, `exclude`), and plotting functions (`subject.plot()`, `transformed.plot()`).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations; data is loaded and processed locally without external communication.",
  "flows": "Dataset is loaded -> transformations with include/exclude are applied -> data is visualized; no data leaks or malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a pediatric dataset, applies targeted transformations using include/exclude parameters, and visualizes the results. All components are standard, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The use of include/exclude is legitimate for selective augmentation. No external data transfer or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs typical preprocessing tasks in medical imaging workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The use of include/exclude parameters is appropriate and does not introduce vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
