  "purpose": "Apply selective transformations to medical imaging data for data augmentation or preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Reading dataset via tio.datasets.Pediatric, setting random seed with torch.manual_seed.",
  "sinks": "Plotting methods (subject.plot(), transformed.plot()) potentially rendering data, but not leaking untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to transformation application and then to visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of standard libraries and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a dataset, applies specific transformations with include/exclude filters, and visualizes the results. No external data input or untrusted sources are used in a harmful way. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign example demonstrating image transformations with inclusion/exclusion filters. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
