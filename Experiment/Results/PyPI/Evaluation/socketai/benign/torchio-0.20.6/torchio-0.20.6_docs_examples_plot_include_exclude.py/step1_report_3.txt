{
  "purpose": "Apply image transformations to a medical imaging subject, with selective inclusion/exclusion of specific image modalities.",
  "sources": "Imports torch and torchio libraries; reads dataset via tio.datasets.Pediatric; creates subject object.",
  "sinks": "Uses transformation functions tio.RandomAffine and tio.RandomBlur which may process image data.",
  "flows": "Dataset is loaded into 'subject', transformations are applied via 'transform', resulting in 'transformed' object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials; usage of random seed for reproducibility is normal. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a pediatric imaging dataset, visualizes it, applies a composition of two transformations with include/exclude parameters, and visualizes the result. The transformations are typical data augmentation techniques. No network communication, system modification, or suspicious logic is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Use of torch and torchio libraries is standard for medical image processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating selective application of image transformations in medical imaging. No malicious intent, no suspicious activity observed.",
