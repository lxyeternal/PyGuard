{
  "purpose": "The code applies image transformations to a medical imaging subject dataset, specifically using random affine transformations and blurring with specified include/exclude options.",
  "sources": "The code reads the pediatric subject dataset from torchio.datasets.Pediatric.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data output or transmission functions; transformations are applied locally within the script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the dataset ('subject') through the transformation pipeline ('transform') which selectively applies transformations based on include/exclude criteria.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard torch and torchio libraries. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, or unusual variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes random seed, loads a pediatric dataset, visualizes it, applies a composed transformation with specific include/exclude parameters, and visualizes the result. No input/output beyond dataset loading and plotting. No network communication, no file manipulation, no credential handling. Usage of well-known libraries with standard functions. The include/exclude parameters are legitimate features for targeted transformations. No anomalies or signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate example demonstrating how to selectively apply image transformations using torchio. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code solely operates on local data and visualization.",
