  "purpose": "Utility functions for downloading, verifying via MD5, and extracting various archive formats, primarily used in data preparation workflows.",
  "sources": "Input URLs for downloads, file paths for verification and extraction, and network responses during urllib.request.urlretrieve.",
  "sinks": "File system writes during download, extraction, and checksum verification; network transmission during download (not malicious in context).",
  "flows": "Input URL -> download_url() retrieves data -> check_integrity() verifies file -> extract_archive() extracts contents.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback from HTTPS to HTTP in download_url(), which could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for file handling and network operations. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow detected. The fallback from HTTPS to HTTP is a known pattern for robustness but introduces a minor security concern. No signs of malware or backdoors. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard utility code with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The fallback mechanism from HTTPS to HTTP is a minor security concern but not malicious. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
