{
  "purpose": "The code implements a structured logging framework for recording test results and related events, facilitating detailed and organized test reporting.",
  "sources": "Method parameters and internal state variables that provide data for log messages.",
  "sinks": "Log handlers that process and output log data; no external network or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs through the logging functions into handlers, with internal state management ensuring proper sequence of events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard logging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive logging system with methods for various test events, crash reports, leaks, and process info. It manages internal state to prevent sequence errors and dispatches data to user-defined handlers. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The use of standard modules and clear structure indicates a benign utility. External handlers could potentially be malicious if compromised, but this risk is external to the code itself. No obfuscation or hidden logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as intended for organizing and dispatching test-related logs.",
