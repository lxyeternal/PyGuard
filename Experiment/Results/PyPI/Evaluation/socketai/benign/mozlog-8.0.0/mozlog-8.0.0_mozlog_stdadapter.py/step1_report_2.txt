{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom logging handlers and wrappers to enable structured logging in Python applications, providing an adapter to convert standard library logging into structured log messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads logger objects and log records; no external inputs or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Logging output via structured log methods; potential for log message modification if misused, but no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Log records are processed in the emit method, routed through structured logger methods based on log level, with no external data flows or untrusted sources beyond standard logging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated elements, or suspicious logic are present. The code relies solely on standard library components and straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom logging handler (UnstructuredHandler) that formats logs using a StructuredLogger class. The LoggingWrapper wraps existing loggers to add this handler, and the std_logging_adapter function provides an interface for converting standard loggers into structured loggers. There are no external inputs, network operations, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of enhancing log management with structured messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for structured logging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or contain backdoors. Overall, it is safe and aligned with common logging practices.",
