{
  "purpose": "Provides a logging handler that wraps structured logging and an adapter to convert standard logging into structured logging format.",
  "sources": "import statements, class constructors, method calls such as 'StructuredLogger(name)', 'logging.getLevelName', 'self.wrapped.addHandler', and 'self.wrapped.name'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'log_func(record.msg)' which output log messages; no other data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Logging record received by 'emit', mapped to structured logger method, then output as message; no untrusted input flows to insecure functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external connections, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logging handler that forwards log messages to a structured logger and an adapter that wraps standard loggers for structured output. It primarily manipulates log messages internally without handling user input or external data. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a utility module for structured logging, with no suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for structured logging. No malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain threats are identified.",
