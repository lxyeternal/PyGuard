  "purpose": "A utility for configuring mozlog-based structured logging, supporting multiple formats and command-line options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variables, file paths for log output",
  "sinks": "Log files or stdout; no external network activity or data exfiltration",
  "flows": "Input from command-line/env to log configuration, writing logs to files or stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured logging setup utility that handles log formatters, command-line options, and file handling safely. It uses common libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The logs are confined to local files or stdout, with no external data flows. The potential security concern is logging sensitive data, but this is a general risk, not an active vulnerability. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation as 0, and the security risk as low (0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging configuration utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
