  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> assign sys.modules alias -> define __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual but standard practice of sys.modules reassignment for legacy support.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script that imports internal modules, manages backward compatibility via sys.modules aliasing, and defines exported symbols. It does not process untrusted input, perform network or file I/O, or execute dynamic code. The sys.modules manipulation, while somewhat unconventional, is a common pattern for legacy support and does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard setup module for Mozilla's logging system with backward compatibility support. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
