  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data validation and structured logging. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2), justified by its utility nature. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use."
