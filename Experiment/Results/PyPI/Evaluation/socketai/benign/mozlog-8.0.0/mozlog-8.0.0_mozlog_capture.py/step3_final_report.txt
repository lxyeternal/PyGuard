{
  "purpose": "This code captures stdout and stderr streams, redirects them through a queue to a logging thread, and ensures thread-safe logging with proper cleanup.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, sys.stderr, the queue used for message passing, and the data written to LoggingWrapper instances.",
  "sinks": "The logger's info and warning methods, which receive log messages from the queue.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sys.stdout/sys.stderr through LoggingWrapper.write() into the queue, then from the queue to LogThread.run() which calls logger methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code uses standard threading, queue, and logging modules without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a multithreaded logging capture utility. It redirects stdout and stderr to custom BytesIO wrappers that enqueue log messages. A dedicated thread consumes this queue and logs messages via the provided logger. Proper setup and cleanup procedures are followed, including thread joining and queue closure. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, using standard Python constructs, and designed for safe log capturing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It effectively captures and redirects output streams for logging purposes without any malicious behavior.",
