  "purpose": "Provides a thread-safe, queue-based logging infrastructure with proxy logger capabilities for multiprocessing environments.",
  "sources": "get_default_logger() call during __getattr__, logger initialization, queue.get() in LogQueueThread.run()",
  "sinks": "self.queue.put() in _handle_log, logger._handle_log() in LogQueueThread.run()",
  "flows": "ProxyLogger __getattr__ -> get_default_logger -> logger methods; LogQueueThread run() -> self.queue.get() -> logger._handle_log()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard threading and queue usage; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard proxy logger that defers initialization until first attribute access, and a queue-based threaded logger for multiprocessing. It uses common patterns such as lazy initialization, threading, and multiprocessing queues. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden functionality. The potential security concern is minimal, related to untrusted data in logs, but this is typical for logging systems and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility designed for multiprocessing environments. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is 0.0. The obfuscation score is 0.0. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting typical concerns with untrusted data in logging queues but no actual threat.",
