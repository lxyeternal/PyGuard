  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'mozlog' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code executes untrusted input or performs data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A - static package configuration, no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage appears to follow standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, data files, and console entry points. It does not include any code that reads external input, executes untrusted code, or communicates externally. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The dependencies are common libraries, and no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical and benign package setup script for a Python project. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscated code are detected. The code is safe for use.",
