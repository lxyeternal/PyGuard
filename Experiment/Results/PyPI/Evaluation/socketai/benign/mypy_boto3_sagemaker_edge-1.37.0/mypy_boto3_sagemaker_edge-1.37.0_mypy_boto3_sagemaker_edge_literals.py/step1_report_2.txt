  "purpose": "Define type annotations and literals for AWS SageMaker Edge service and related AWS services.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys and typing), string literals defining types and service names.",
  "sinks": "None found; no dynamic or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A, static definitions only; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code primarily consists of static type aliases and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for specific string literals used in boto3 stubs. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version. The vast list of service and resource names is statically defined without any dynamic or executable code. No functions, user inputs, network calls, or file operations are present. No obfuscation, encryption, or code that could hide malicious intent is observed. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured module meant for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type aliases and constants for AWS service identifiers, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not execute any untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network operations. It is safe and aligns with its intended purpose as a type definition module.",
