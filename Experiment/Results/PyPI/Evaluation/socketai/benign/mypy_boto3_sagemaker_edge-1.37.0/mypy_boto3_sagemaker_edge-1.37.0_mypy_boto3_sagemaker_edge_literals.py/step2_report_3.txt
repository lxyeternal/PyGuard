  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines static string literal types for AWS SageMaker Edge and related services, with no external data handling or dynamic behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data processing. The version-dependent import of `Literal` is standard practice.\n- **Risk assessment:** The report correctly concludes that this is a benign, static type definition module with no security risks.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on AWS service identifiers, with static definitions and no dynamic code.\n- **Findings:** No external data, no network activity, no code execution. The list of service names is hardcoded and static.\n- **Risk assessment:** Correctly identified as safe, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines string literal types for AWS services, with static data and no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No I/O, no dynamic code, no external dependencies or secrets. The code is purely for type annotations.\n- **Risk assessment:** The conclusion of no security risks or malware is accurate.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar static definitions with conditional import for compatibility.\n- **Findings:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling.\n- **Risk assessment:** The code remains a benign static type declaration.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines AWS service literal types with no dynamic behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external interactions.\n- **Risk assessment:** The code is purely for static type annotations.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly note the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, read-only nature of the code, the risk score should be very low, ideally 0 or close to it.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0, since the code is static and safe.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nConsidering the purpose and content, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a simple, static set of type definitions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric          | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0      | No malicious code, obfuscation, or external threats present. |\n| Obfuscated      | 0      | Code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.       |\n| Security Risk   | 0      | No runtime behavior, external data, or vulnerabilities.    |\n\n**Final note:** This supply chain component is safe, intended solely for type hinting, and poses no security threat.",
