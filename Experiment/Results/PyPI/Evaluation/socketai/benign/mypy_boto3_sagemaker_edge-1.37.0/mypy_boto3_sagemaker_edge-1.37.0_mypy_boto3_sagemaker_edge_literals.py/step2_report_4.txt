  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  - Purpose: Type literals for AWS SageMaker Edge and related services.  \n  - Findings: Static definitions, no external input, no malicious behavior.  \n  - Conclusion: Benign static type definitions, no security risks.  \n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  - Purpose: Type annotations for AWS services.  \n  - Findings: Static string literals, no dynamic code or external data.  \n  - Conclusion: Safe, straightforward, no malicious intent.  \n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  - Purpose: Type definitions for sagemaker-edge literals.  \n  - Findings: Static data, no I/O or external interactions.  \n  - Conclusion: Purely static, safe, no malware.  \n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  - Purpose: Type annotations for AWS service literals.  \n  - Findings: Standard conditional import, static string literals, no malicious code.  \n  - Conclusion: Benign, purely declarative.  \n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  - Purpose: Type annotations for AWS service identifiers and statuses.  \n  - Findings: Static definitions, no dynamic code or external data.  \n  - Conclusion: Safe, straightforward, no malicious behavior.  \n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static type alias definitions using `Literal`. There are no functions, no data processing, no network calls, no external data, and no dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:**  \n  None of the reports find any signs of malware or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.\n\n- **Security Risks:**  \n  Since the code only defines string literals for type annotations, it does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the analysis. Given the static nature and the absence of any malicious or suspicious patterns, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports agree on 0.  \n- The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n- The code is purely static type definitions with no external interactions.\n\n**Confidence Level:**  \n- High (1.0), as all reports concur and the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n**Based on the provided reports and the code analysis, I concur that:**\n\n- The code is **benign**, static, and intended solely for type hinting.\n- There are **no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks**.\n- The scores assigned are **appropriate and reasonable**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0               | Clear, straightforward static definitions.                  |\n| Risk Score      | 0                 | No external data handling, no runtime code, no security concern. |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a well-structured, static type definition module with no security concerns. The assigned scores are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
