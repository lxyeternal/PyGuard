  "purpose": "Define type annotations for sagemaker-edge service literal definitions and related AWS service identifiers.",
  "sources": "Imports sys module; Conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; Definitions of string Literal types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, outputs, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A — No data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import based on Python version; extensive string literal definitions; no suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines string literal types for AWS SDK usage, with no data input, network activity, or code execution. The conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version is a standard compatibility pattern. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The scope is limited to type annotations and constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a type definition module for AWS service literals, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign, purely declarative code segment.",
