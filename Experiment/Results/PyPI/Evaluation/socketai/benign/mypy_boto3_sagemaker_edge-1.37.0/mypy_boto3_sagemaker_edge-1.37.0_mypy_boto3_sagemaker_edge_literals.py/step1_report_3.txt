{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for sagemaker-edge service literals, used for type annotations and documentation in Python code.",
  "sources": "Static data declarations; no dynamic input, file reads, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns literal types to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. Conditional import based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static type definitions using 'Literal' from typing or typing_extensions. It includes version-dependent imports and a long list of string literals assigned to variables. There are no input/output operations, no execution of code at runtime, no network calls, or external dependencies that could be malicious. The structure and content are straightforward and serve as type annotations/documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely static type annotations and documentation. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and has no suspicious behavior. It is safe and standard for defining string literal types for AWS service names and statuses.",
