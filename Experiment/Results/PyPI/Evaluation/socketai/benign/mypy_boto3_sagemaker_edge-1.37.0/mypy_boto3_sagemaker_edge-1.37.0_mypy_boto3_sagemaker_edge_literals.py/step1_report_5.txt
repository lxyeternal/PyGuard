{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for sagemaker-edge service literal definitions, providing clear and type-safe string literals for various AWS service identifiers and statuses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, and the assignment of Literal types to constants defining various string literal types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output handling present; no data sinks that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code solely defines constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward type alias definitions for documentation and type checking purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard modules, conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, and defines multiple string literal types for use as annotations in boto3 stubs for AWS services. All definitions are static and serve as documentation/type hints. No input handling, dynamic execution, or system manipulation present. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS service string literals, intended for use in type checking and documentation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
