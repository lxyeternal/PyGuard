  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SageMaker Edge and related service identifiers, statuses, and regions to facilitate static type checking.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external output; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or processing occurs at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type annotations with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Python's Literal, with a version-dependent import. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or obfuscation. The conditional import is standard for compatibility across Python versions. No secrets, dynamic code, or network activity are present. The code serves as a static type hinting module for AWS service identifiers and statuses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
