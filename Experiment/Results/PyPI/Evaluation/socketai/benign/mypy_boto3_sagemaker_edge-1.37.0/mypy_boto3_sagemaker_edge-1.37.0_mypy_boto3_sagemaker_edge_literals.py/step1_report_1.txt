  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SageMaker Edge service and related AWS services for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals; no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code solely provides static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation observed. The code is straightforward type alias definitions with conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several string literal types for use in type annotations related to AWS services. It includes a version-dependent import for 'Literal', which is standard practice. No input processing, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leaks, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is the version-dependent import, which is benign and typical for compatibility. The code appears to be a simple, static module for type hinting, with no runtime effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type definition module intended for type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data processing, and is purely for type hinting support. No security risks are present.",
