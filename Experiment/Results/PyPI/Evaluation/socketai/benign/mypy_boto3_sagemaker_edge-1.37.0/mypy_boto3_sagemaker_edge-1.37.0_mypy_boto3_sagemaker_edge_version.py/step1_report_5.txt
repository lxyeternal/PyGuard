  "purpose": "Define and store the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only assigns a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data flows or could leak.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely simple and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring comment and a single assignment of a version string to __version__. It includes a copyright statement with a future year (2025), which is unconventional but not suspicious. The structure and content are typical for version declaration in Python projects, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
