  "anomalies": "Absence of unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The comment header indicates source information and copyright.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version declaration with a copyright comment. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no secret data, or suspicious logic. The version string is hardcoded, which is typical for such files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a benign, common pattern in Python packages.",
