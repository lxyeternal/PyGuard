  "purpose": "Define and expose the version number of the module or package.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and contains only a version string and a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment header with copyright information and a single assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no input sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or sensitive operations. It simply declares a version constant, which is common in Python modules. The version string appears static and not manipulated at runtime. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as metadata for the module/package.",
