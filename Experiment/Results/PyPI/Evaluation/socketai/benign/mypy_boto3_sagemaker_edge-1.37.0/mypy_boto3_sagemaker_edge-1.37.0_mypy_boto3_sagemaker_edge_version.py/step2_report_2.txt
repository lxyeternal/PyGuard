  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues, scores, and conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with an accompanying copyright comment.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for Python modules.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright comment, which is likely an oversight or typo but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no input handling, no dynamic code, and no suspicious logic.\n- The only questionable point is the future year \"2025\" in the comment, which is not malicious but could be an oversight.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n\n- The reports correctly dismiss the future year as an anomaly but do not consider it a security concern.\n- No logical errors are present in the reasoning; the conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0, which are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, which seems reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The securityRisk score is 0 in all cases, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score. The code is purely declarative with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### Additional critical points:\n\n- The only minor point is the future year \"2025\" in the comment, which could suggest the code was written in the future or an oversight. However, this is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven all the above, **the overall scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk**. The confidence remains high because the code is straightforward.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0             |\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The minor anomaly (future year) is not a security issue but should be corrected for accuracy.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**  \n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, safe version declaration.",
