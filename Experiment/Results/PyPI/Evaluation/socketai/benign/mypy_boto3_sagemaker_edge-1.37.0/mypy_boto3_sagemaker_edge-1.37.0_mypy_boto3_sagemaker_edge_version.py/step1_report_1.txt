  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module, serving as a source of truth for version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assignment (__version__ = \"1.37.0\") and the copyright comment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code sets a version variable; no data flows from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright comment with a future year (2025), which may be inconsistent or suspicious but not malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string with an accompanying copyright comment. It does not include any user input handling, network operations, or secret handling. The presence of a future copyright year might indicate an oversight but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration typical in Python modules. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
