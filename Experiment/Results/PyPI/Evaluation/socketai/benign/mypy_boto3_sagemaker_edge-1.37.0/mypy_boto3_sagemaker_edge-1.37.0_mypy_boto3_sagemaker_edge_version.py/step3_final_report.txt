  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '__version__ = \"1.37.0\"' and the copyright comment.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "The comment contains a future year '2025', which is likely an oversight but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with a comment. No dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only anomaly is the future year in the comment, which is not a security concern. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
