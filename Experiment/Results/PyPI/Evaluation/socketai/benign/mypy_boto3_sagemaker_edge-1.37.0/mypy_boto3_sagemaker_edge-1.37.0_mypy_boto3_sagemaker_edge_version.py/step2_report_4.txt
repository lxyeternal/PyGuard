  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Findings:** Simple version assignment, future copyright year (2025), no malicious behavior.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the risk score of 0 aligns with the benign nature.\n   - **Scores:** All scores are appropriate; malware and securityRisk are 0.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward version declaration, no anomalies.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No issues, no obfuscation, malware score of 0.\n   - **Scores:** Appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Findings:** Simple static assignment, no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or obfuscation, malware score of 0.\n   - **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Findings:** Standard version string, no dynamic code, no anomalies.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No security risks or malware, scores are appropriate.\n   - **Scores:** No change needed.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Findings:** Very straightforward, with a future copyright year.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. The future year might be unconventional but is not suspicious or malicious.\n   - **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that this is a benign version declaration.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risks or vulnerabilities are introduced by this code.\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.
