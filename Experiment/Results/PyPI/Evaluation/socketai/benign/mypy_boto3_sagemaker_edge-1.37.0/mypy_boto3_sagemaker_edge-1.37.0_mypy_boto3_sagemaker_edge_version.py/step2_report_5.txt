  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- It contains only a comment with a copyright notice, including a future year (2025).\n- No user input, network activity, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any operations beyond assigning a string.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and simple.\n\n- **Anomalies?**  \n  The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which might be a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Benign version declaration, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1  \n- **Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Standard version declaration, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as expected.\n- The **security risk** is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The **confidence** is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The only minor point is the future year (2025), which might be a typo but doesn't impact security assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the current scores and conclusions. No changes necessary.",
