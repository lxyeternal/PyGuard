  "analysis": "The code includes a copyright notice, a version variable assignment, and a comment. It performs a straightforward static assignment of a version string to a variable, with no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external dependencies or obfuscated elements. The code appears to be a standard version declaration without any malicious components or suspicious behaviors.",
