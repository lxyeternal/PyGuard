  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a minimal interface module that imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- The documentation includes a usage example, a URL, and licensing info.\n- No user input, external data, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware indicators are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no obfuscated code, malware score 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward wrapper.\n- **Score suggestion:** Consistent with the code; no change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with the only anomaly being the future copyright year.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; just a simple interface.\n- **Score suggestion:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.  \n  The report's confidence is 1, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious code or data flow.\n- **Anomaly:** Future copyright year.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign module.\n- **Score suggestion:** No change; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Anomaly:** Future date.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Score suggestion:** Scores are consistent; no change.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as others; straightforward, documentation, import, aliasing.\n- **Anomaly:** None significant.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Score suggestion:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring consistency:\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and security risk = 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 0.95), appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- The only noted anomaly (future date) is not malicious but could be flagged as a minor concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The future copyright year is likely a placeholder or typo, but it does not impact security.\n- The code is a standard interface module, typical for SDKs or client libraries.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided reports and code analysis, **my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0**\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment, and no further action is necessary.",
