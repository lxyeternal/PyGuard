{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface and documentation for the sagemaker-edge service client setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module (.client), documentation string, and code assigning a class to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code does not handle input or data processing; it mainly imports and assigns classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply sets up references for later use.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a module for importing and exposing the sagemaker-edge client class. It contains a documentation string with usage instructions and a link, which appears legitimate. The import statement pulls a class from a local module, and the class is assigned to a variable for easier access. The code does not process user input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, but this is not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for the sagemaker-edge client interface, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured setup script.",
