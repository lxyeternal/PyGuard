{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface and documentation for the sagemaker-edge service client, allowing users to instantiate and interact with the service.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.client' and the embedded documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the client class, assigning it to a variable, and exposing it via __all__, with no data processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future, indicating potential inconsistency or placeholder. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module that sets up an interface for the sagemaker-edge service. It includes a documentation string with a usage example, imports a client class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and defines what symbols are exported. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data interactions are present. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is clean, standard, and does not contain suspicious or malicious logic.",
