{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the sagemaker-edge service, importing the client class and setting up the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Imports the SagemakerEdgeManagerClient class from a relative module; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses class instantiation and attribute assignment; no direct untrusted data sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Imports class -> assigns class to variable -> exports variable; no untrusted data flow or external command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only documentation, import statements, class aliasing, and module exports; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports a class, assigns it to a variable, and declares exports. It includes a documentation string with a link and copyright notice. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The content appears standard for a Python SDK interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign interface module with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It mainly facilitates access to a client class for the sagemaker-edge service.",
