  "purpose": "Provide a main interface module for interacting with the sagemaker-edge service, exposing the SagemakerEdgeManagerClient class for use in other code.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing SagemakerEdgeManagerClient from a local module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output generation observed",
  "flows": "Import of the client class, then assigning it to the variable Client for external use",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with clear documentation and licensing info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a client class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and defines module exports. It includes documentation with a URL, copyright info, and usage example. No user input, external data sources, or sink functions are present. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a standard wrapper or interface setup for a service client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that provides access to a service client class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a simple, well-structured interface module with no suspicious behaviors.",
