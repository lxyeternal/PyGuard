  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scores assigned, and any potential issues.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- The documentation string provides usage instructions and a URL, which appears legitimate.\n- All reports agree that there are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future and likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Presence of issues in the code:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports indicate the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n#### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Future copyright year (2025):**  \n  This is an inconsistency but not a security flaw. It might be a typo or placeholder.\n\n#### Scores assigned:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  0 in all cases, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All are 0 or very low (0.0 to 0.05). Given the benign nature, this seems appropriate.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code is simple, does not handle untrusted data, or perform any risky operations.\n\n#### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious or high-risk behavior.  \n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n#### Malware considerations:\n- The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input.\n- No signs of malware or backdoors.\n\n#### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No questionable assumptions are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with the analysis)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Estimated scores based on my review:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but perhaps a documentation oversight.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**. The code is a standard, safe interface module with no security issues.",
