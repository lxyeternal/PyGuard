{
  "purpose": "To provide a main interface for the SageMaker Edge service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements for the client class, and the script's own module code.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no use of untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly defines and re-exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and mainly documentation, imports, and aliasing; no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a docstring with documentation links and licensing info. It imports a client class from a relative module, then creates an alias. No data input, external network calls, or data handling occurs here. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The purpose is to set up a module interface. Overall, the code is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple module setup with documentation and class aliasing for a SageMaker Edge client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
