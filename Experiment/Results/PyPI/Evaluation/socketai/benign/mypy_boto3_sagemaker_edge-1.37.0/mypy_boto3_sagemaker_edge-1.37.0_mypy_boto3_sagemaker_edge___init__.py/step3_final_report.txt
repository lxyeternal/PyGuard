  "purpose": "Provide an interface module for the sagemaker-edge service, exposing the client class for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.client import SagemakerEdgeManagerClient)",
  "sinks": "Assignment of class to variable Client, exposure via __all__",
  "flows": "Import -> assignment to Client -> exposure through __all__",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a placeholder or typo",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward Python module that imports a class, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it. No user input, external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder and not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. The confidence scores are high, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The minor anomaly (future date) does not impact security but could be flagged as a documentation oversight. Overall, the code poses no security threat and functions as a standard SDK interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only minor concern is the placeholder copyright year, which does not affect security. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
