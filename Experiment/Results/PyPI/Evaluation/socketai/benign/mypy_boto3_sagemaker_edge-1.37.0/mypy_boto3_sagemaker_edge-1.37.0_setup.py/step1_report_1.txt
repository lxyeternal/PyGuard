  "purpose": "This setup script installs the 'mypy-boto3-sagemaker-edge' Python package and specifies its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for the long description; uses setuptools.setup to configure package installation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content and passes configuration data to setuptools.setup; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no handling of untrusted input are present. It appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It follows standard practices and contains no suspicious elements.",
