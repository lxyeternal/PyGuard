  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-sagemaker-edge package, providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, static package data, and static metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None of the code executes untrusted data or external commands; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is statically defined or read from local files during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The copyright year appears to be in the future (2025), but that does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for a package. It reads a local README.md file for description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. The code uses straightforward static data with no dynamic execution, user input, or external data processing. There are no suspicious code constructs, obfuscated sections, or potential backdoors. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year being in the future (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security issues are present based on the provided code.",
