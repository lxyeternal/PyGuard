  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-sagemaker-edge package, used to define package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and imports standard modules and setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external interactions that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The script performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a README file for documentation, and defines package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic or potentially unsafe operations. No input validation or external code execution beyond package setup. The code appears to be a typical Python setup script with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations such as reading a README file and configuring package metadata. No sensitive data, external connections, or suspicious logic are present.",
