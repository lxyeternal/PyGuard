  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-sagemaker-edge' to facilitate package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code reads untrusted data or interacts with external inputs during execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The script performs standard package setup procedures without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external commands are invoked dynamically. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and contains no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements. It performs standard package configuration without any anomalous or malicious behavior.",
