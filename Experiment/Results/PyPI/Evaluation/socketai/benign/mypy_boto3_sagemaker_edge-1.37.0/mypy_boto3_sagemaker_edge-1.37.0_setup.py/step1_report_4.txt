{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging the Python module 'mypy-boto3-sagemaker-edge'. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration options for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; retrieves package data from the filesystem; reads environment variables via setuptools (indirectly).",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct data sinks that handle untrusted input; no network connections or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and defines package metadata; no untrusted data flows or user input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated behavior are detected. The code strictly follows standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a static README file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata parameters. All values are hardcoded or derived from local files. There are no external data inputs, no code execution based on external input, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
