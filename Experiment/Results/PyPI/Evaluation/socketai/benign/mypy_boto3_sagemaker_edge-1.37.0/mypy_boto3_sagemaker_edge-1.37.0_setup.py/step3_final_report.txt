  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging mypy-boto3-sagemaker-edge with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata fields; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or untrusted inputs processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year '2025' is in the future, likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence (1). The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The code's static and straightforward nature confirms its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
