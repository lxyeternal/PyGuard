  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the SageMaker Edge Manager service in boto3, enabling type-safe interaction with AWS services.",
  "sources": "Code imports from standard libraries, boto3, botocore, and local type definitions. No input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "Function signatures and properties that return data, mainly API call interfaces. No direct sinks for untrusted data, no system effects or external connections are explicitly coded.",
  "flows": "Method calls that would invoke AWS service operations with provided parameters; no actual data processing or external communication in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The code appears to be standard, well-documented, and structured for type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for the SageMaker Edge service with type annotations, properties, and method signatures aligned with boto3's API. No logic, data handling, or external interactions are implemented directly; it mainly serves as a type stub or interface. No suspicious constructs, data leaks, or malicious patterns are detected. The only potential concern is the exposure of documentation links and class structures, which is standard for SDKs. Overall, it appears to be a benign, type-focused module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK type annotation and client interface for AWS SageMaker Edge. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, serving as a type-safe wrapper for API calls. It is safe for use, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
