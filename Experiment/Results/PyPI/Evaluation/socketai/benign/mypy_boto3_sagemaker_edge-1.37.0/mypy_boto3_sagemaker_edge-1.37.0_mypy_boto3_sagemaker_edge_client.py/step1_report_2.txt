  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the SageMaker Edge Manager service, facilitating type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal type definitions; class and method definitions that interact with AWS service APIs.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as generate_presigned_url, get_deployments, get_device_registration, and send_heartbeat that interact with AWS services, especially the generate_presigned_url method which could generate URLs for resource access.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like ClientMethod, Params, ExpiresIn, and HttpMethod flow into generate_presigned_url; kwargs unpacked into API methods like get_deployments, get_device_registration, and send_heartbeat; these flow from external inputs to API calls and URL generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of type annotations and method signatures align with standard SDK patterns. No suspicious obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for the SageMaker Edge service with methods matching the AWS SDK pattern, including URL signing and resource querying. The imports and class structure appear standard for a type-annotated SDK wrapper. The generate_presigned_url method could potentially generate URLs for resources, but it is a common SDK feature. No evidence of malicious data handling, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The code relies on external AWS SDKs and does not contain any logic that could be exploited maliciously within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate SDK client wrapper with thorough type annotations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of generate_presigned_url and API method signatures is typical for AWS SDKs. No malicious intent or security threat identified.",
