  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the SageMaker Edge SDK, serving as a safe interface for API interactions without executing logic or external data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, and method signatures that define the SDK interface; no external data reading or code execution.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters such as 'Params' in 'generate_presigned_url' and unpacked kwargs in API methods, which could potentially handle untrusted input but are standard SDK features.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK methods; no data processing or external effects are present; method calls are straightforward API wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is a clear, well-structured SDK interface with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-annotated SDK interface for AWS SageMaker Edge, primarily defining method signatures and type annotations. It does not include logic that could be malicious or insecure. The use of 'generate_presigned_url' and unpacked kwargs are typical SDK features, not indicators of malicious intent. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The security risk scores assigned (mostly 0.1) are justified by the potential for URL generation features but are not inherently risky. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscation score is 0, indicating a benign, transparent codebase. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the clarity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minor security risk score reflects typical SDK features like URL signing and parameter unpacking, which are not malicious. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malware.",
