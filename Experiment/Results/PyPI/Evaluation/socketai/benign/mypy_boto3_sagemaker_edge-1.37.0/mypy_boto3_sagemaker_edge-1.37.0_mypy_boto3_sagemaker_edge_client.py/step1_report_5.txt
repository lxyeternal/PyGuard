  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the SageMaker Edge Manager service in boto3, enabling type-safe interactions with the AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs; class and method definitions reading/writing AWS SDK data structures.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate URLs, perform API calls with parameters, and return structured responses; potential points where untrusted input could influence external calls or output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to methods like generate_presigned_url and API call results returned by get_deployments, get_device_registration, send_heartbeat.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or unusual code patterns detected. The code primarily consists of type annotations and method signatures. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and class definition for a boto3 client. It imports standard modules, uses conditional imports based on Python version, and defines a client class with documented methods mirroring AWS API endpoints. No logic manipulates untrusted data or executes code dynamically. The 'generate_presigned_url' method accepts parameters that could influence URL generation but does not perform any malicious actions itself. All classes and methods serve as type-safe wrappers around AWS SDK functionalities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears purely to facilitate type-safe AWS service interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type annotation and client wrapper for the SageMaker Edge service, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It is a normal SDK helper module with no indications of supply chain attacks or malware.",
