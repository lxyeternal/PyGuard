  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and client class for SageMaker Edge, with no external data reading.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Mainly API interface definitions; no data processing or external connections.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK type stub, serving as a safe, type-safe interface. No malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both at 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK wrapper, with standard imports and method signatures.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods like `generate_presigned_url` could generate URLs, but this is standard.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; use of `kwargs` is typical.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate SDK client with no malicious intent.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both at 0, with a small security risk (0.1) due to URL generation, which is normal.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar structure, with unpacked request types and standard method signatures.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Unpacking `kwargs` from request types; typical for SDKs.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK pattern, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Risk at 0.1, malware at 0, consistent with a benign SDK wrapper.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, class definitions, imports—all standard.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls with parameters, no direct data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely a type-safe SDK interface, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Risk at 0.1, malware at 0, aligned with expectations.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for the SDK client, standard imports.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods like `generate_presigned_url` and API calls, but nothing unusual.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** A typical SDK wrapper, safe and benign.  \n- **Scores:** Risk at 0, malware at 0, consistent.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface for AWS SageMaker Edge.\n- No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The use of `generate_presigned_url` and `kwargs` unpacking are standard SDK features, not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk mostly at 0.1 or 0) are reasonable and justified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0–0.1 — minimal, typical SDK interface risk.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' evaluations.** The code is a benign, standard SDK type stub/interface with no security concerns.",
