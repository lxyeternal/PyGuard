{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the sagemaker-edge service Client, facilitating type-safe interaction with AWS SageMaker Edge Manager.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions from '.type_defs' and system information from 'sys'. It also accesses class attributes and methods via the boto3 SDK interface.",
  "sinks": "Methods return or process data through the boto3 SDK; no direct sinks like network transmission or file writing are explicitly shown, but the SDK methods could potentially be exploited if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from SDK method calls (like get_deployments, get_device_registration, send_heartbeat) through parameters (unpacked from type defs) and returns data, with no apparent untrusted input handling within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a boto3 client wrapper, importing necessary modules, defining exception classes, and implementing a client class with documented methods. All code appears standard for SDK interface definition and does not include any malicious behaviors. The only notable aspect is reliance on external type definitions and the SDK, but these are typical and do not suggest malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, network manipulations, or other suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and client wrapper for AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates type-safe SDK interactions without performing any risky operations itself.",
