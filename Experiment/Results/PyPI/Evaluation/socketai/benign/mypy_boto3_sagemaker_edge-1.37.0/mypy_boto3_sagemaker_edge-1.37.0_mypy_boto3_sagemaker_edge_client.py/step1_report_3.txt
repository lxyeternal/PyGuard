  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the sagemaker-edge service, facilitating type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definition imports, class attributes, method signatures, property decorators.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters, especially **kwargs unpacked from request type definitions, which could include untrusted input if misused.",
  "flows": "Unpacking of request types into method parameters, direct method calls with parameters that could be externally influenced.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of '...' as default parameters is typical for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured client class with clear method signatures for interacting with the sagemaker-edge service. It uses type annotations and property methods for exception handling. No network calls, data leaks, or malicious constructs are present. The imports and class design follow standard patterns for boto3 stubs. There are no indications of obfuscated or malicious code. The only potentially sensitive aspect is the use of '**kwargs' unpacking from request types, but this is typical for boto3 clients and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type definition and client class for AWS SageMaker Edge, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain backdoors. Security risks are minimal and typical of AWS SDK stub files.",
