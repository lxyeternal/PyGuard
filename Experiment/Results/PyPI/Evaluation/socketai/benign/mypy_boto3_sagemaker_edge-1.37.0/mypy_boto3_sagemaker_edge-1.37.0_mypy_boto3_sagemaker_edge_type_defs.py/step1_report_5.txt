  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the sagemaker-edge service in Python, facilitating type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or untrusted data; it only defines type annotations and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output mechanisms; the code solely declares data types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no runtime data handling or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code uses version-dependent imports and type definitions, which are standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type definitions using TypedDict and Union for a Python SDK related to AWS SageMaker Edge. It includes conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, but no runtime logic, input handling, or output mechanisms. The code is purely declarative, aimed at providing structured type annotations for SDK consumers. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The presence of documentation and licensing info suggests legitimate intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for a SDK, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It’s designed solely for type safety and documentation purposes.",
