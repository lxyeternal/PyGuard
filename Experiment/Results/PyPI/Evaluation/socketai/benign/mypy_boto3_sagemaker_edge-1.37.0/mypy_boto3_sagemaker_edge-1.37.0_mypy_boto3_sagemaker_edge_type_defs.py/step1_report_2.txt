  "purpose": "Type annotations and structured definitions for sagemaker-edge service data models to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions, and internal literals; definitions of TypedDicts and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input handling, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flow is confined within static type definitions; no dynamic or runtime data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden code, or obfuscated elements. The code primarily consists of type definitions and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations for various data structures used in the sagemaker-edge service. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version for compatibility. The TypedDicts define expected data schemas, with optional fields indicated by NotRequired. No functions, dynamic code execution, or data processing is present that could lead to malicious behavior. The only external link is documentation, and the copyright notice does not influence code execution. Overall, the code is standard for type definitions with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type annotations and data schemas for AWS sagemaker-edge, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static type definition module to improve code clarity and tooling support.",
