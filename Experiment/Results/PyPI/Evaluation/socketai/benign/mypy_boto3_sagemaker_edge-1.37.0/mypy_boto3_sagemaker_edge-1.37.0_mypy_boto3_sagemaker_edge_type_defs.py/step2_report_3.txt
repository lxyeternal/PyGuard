  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines various TypedDict data structures for the sagemaker-edge service.\n- It employs conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions.\n- It contains no executable logic, data handling, network operations, or data processing routines.\n- The only external link is documentation, and the copyright notice is benign.\n- Overall, it serves as static type annotations and data schemas.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Presence of Issues in the Code\n- **Confirmed:** The code is purely type annotations with no executable logic or external data handling.\n- **No issues detected** in the actual code content.\n\n### 2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning\n- **Accurate:** The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, purely for type annotations, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **No flaws or mistakes** in their reasoning.\n\n### 3. Review of the Scores Given to Each Issue\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- **These scores are appropriate** given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### 4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5\n- Since **all evidence points to benign, static type definitions**, there's **no justification** for higher risk scores.\n- The code does not execute, process external data, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n\n### 5. Malware Score Justification\n- The malware score is **correctly set to 0** in all reports.\n- There are **no signs of malicious behavior**, such as code injection, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n### 6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they explicitly state that the code is only type definitions with no external data handling.\n- This is accurate; no assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n\n### 7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations.\n- No executable logic, data handling, or external input processing.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The provided reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is purely static type annotations with no malicious or risky elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
