  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code:\n\n**Overall Analysis of the Code:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type annotations and data structure definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- There are no functions, executable logic, network operations, or data processing routines.\n- The only external reference is a documentation URL, which is standard.\n- The copyright notice is present but does not influence code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to serve as a schema or interface for data validation and type checking in the sagemaker-edge SDK.\n\n**Security and Malware Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** The code is purely declarative, with no runtime or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The malware score of 0 aligns with this assessment.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques. The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice. Obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** No external data handling, no data sinks, no untrusted input processing. The code does not introduce any attack surface. Security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistently 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The detailed analyses reinforce that the code is a standard type definition module with no malicious or suspicious characteristics.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n\n- No issues found. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely for static type annotations.\n- The documentation and licensing are standard and do not raise concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores and assessments are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe set of type annotations with no security concerns.",
