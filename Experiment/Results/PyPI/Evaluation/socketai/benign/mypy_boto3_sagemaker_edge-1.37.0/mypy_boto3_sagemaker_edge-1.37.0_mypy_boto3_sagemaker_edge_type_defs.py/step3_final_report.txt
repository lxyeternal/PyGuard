{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations and data schemas for the sagemaker-edge service using TypedDict, aimed at static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and type definitions within the module; no runtime data sources or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static type definitions with no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A — no executable code or data flow; only type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with conditional imports for compatibility, and contains no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, network operations, or data processing routines. The absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations indicates a benign purpose. The documentation link and copyright notice are standard. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of static type annotations serving as data schemas for the sagemaker-edge SDK. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
