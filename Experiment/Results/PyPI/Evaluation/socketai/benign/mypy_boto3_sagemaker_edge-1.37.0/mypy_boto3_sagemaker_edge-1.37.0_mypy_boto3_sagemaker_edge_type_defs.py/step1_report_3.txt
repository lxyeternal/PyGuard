{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for sagemaker-edge service type definitions to facilitate type checking and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant strings, imported type definitions, and type hints from standard libraries, as well as module-level documentation and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only defines data types and constants without executing or processing external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely establishes static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard type annotations with version-dependent imports.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules based on Python version, defines several TypedDict classes and type aliases for structured data used in AWS SageMaker Edge service interactions. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling logic is present. The code's structure is straightforward and adheres to common patterns for type hinting, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK or application, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only provides static type annotations and data schemas necessary for development and type checking.",
