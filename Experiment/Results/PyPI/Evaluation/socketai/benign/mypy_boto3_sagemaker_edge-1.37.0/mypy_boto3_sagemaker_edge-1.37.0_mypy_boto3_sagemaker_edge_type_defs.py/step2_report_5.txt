  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code to determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent, and to identify any overlooked risks.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of static type definitions using TypedDict, type aliases, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- It contains no executable logic, no data processing, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code.\n- The only external link is to documentation; the copyright is a future date (2025), which is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is purely declarative, intended for type checking and documentation support.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is standard type annotation definitions.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes:** None detected. The code appears consistent, well-structured, and uses common patterns for compatibility and type safety.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code hiding techniques are used.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- The code is purely declarative and does not introduce any attack surface.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n- **Claims about benign nature:** All reports correctly identify the code as standard, non-malicious, and purely for type annotations.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's static, declarative nature.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The future copyright date (2025) is unusual but not malicious; it might be a placeholder or typo.\n- The external documentation link is benign, assuming it points to legitimate documentation.\n- The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Maintain current scores and conclusions.**\n- **No further action needed.**\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and serves its purpose for static type checking in the SDK.",
