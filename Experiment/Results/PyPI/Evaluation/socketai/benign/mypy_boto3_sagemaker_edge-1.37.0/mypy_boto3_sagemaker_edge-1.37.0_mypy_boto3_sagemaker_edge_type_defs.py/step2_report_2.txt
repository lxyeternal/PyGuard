  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type annotations and data structure definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network calls, or external input handling are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The only external reference is a documentation URL, which is standard.\n- The copyright notice is benign and does not influence execution.\n- The code appears to serve as a schema for data validation and code clarity within an SDK or application.\n\n**Assessment of potential issues:**\n\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None of the reports indicate any signs of malicious code, such as backdoors, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard practices for compatibility and type hinting.\n- **Security risks:** No runtime data handling, no external data sources, and no dynamic code execution are present that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, but given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or overestimations:**\n\n- Some reports assign a risk score of 0.5 or higher, citing no specific vulnerabilities but possibly considering the code as a security component. However, since there's no dynamic behavior, no data handling, and no external inputs, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for an SDK.\n- It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, though some could be lowered to reflect the absence of any risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — purely static type definitions with no security implications.\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' conclusions that the code is safe and benign.",
