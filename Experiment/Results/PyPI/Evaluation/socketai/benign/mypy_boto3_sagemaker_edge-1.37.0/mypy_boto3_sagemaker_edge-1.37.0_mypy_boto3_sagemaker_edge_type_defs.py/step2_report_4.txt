  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Code Review and Issues Confirmed:**\n- The code solely consists of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation comments.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network calls, or external input handling is present.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema or interface for data validation and tooling support.\n\n**2. Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard for type annotations and data schemas.\n- No mention of external data handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.\n- The summaries are consistent and accurate regarding the benign nature of the code.\n\n**3. Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores align well with the analysis.\n\n**4. Malware and Security Risk Assessment:**\n- The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads.\n- The documentation and licensing are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n**5. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly state that the code is purely type annotations with no malicious intent.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the static analysis of the code.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\nGiven the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate. The code is a well-structured, standard set of type annotations for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and serves as static type definitions.\n- The scores provided by all reports are accurate and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- These scores accurately reflect the code's nature and security posture.",
