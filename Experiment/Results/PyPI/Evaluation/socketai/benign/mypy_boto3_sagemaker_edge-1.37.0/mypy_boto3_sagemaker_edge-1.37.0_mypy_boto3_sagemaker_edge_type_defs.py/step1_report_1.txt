  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for the sagemaker-edge service used for data validation and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines data structures only.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows, as the code is purely type annotation definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted data, as this module only provides type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code uses standard Python typing and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various TypedDict data structures for the sagemaker-edge service, employing conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It includes no executable logic, no data handling, and no network or file operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure is consistent with standard type annotations and documentation comments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations and data structure definitions for a service SDK. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves as a schema for data validation and code clarity, with no external data sources or sinks.",
