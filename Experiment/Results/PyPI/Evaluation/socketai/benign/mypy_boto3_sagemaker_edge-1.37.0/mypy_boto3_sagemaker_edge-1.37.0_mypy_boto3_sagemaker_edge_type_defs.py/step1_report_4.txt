  "purpose": "Define type annotations for sagemaker-edge service data structures for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, sys.version_info, imported modules, and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code solely defines data types and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. Use of type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and a purpose description. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing routines that could lead to malicious activity. All imports are standard libraries or from the same package, and there are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. The version checks for importing typing features are routine for compatibility. Overall, the code serves as type definitions for SDKs and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions intended for static typing support in Python projects. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. The code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
