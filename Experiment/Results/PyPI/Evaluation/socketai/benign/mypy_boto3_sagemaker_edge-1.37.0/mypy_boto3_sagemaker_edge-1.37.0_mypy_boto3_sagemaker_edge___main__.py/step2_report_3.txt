  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses standard library functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write`) with no external dependencies.\n   - There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.\n   - No network activity, data leaks, or external data handling are present.\n   - The code's logic is straightforward, primarily static output.\n\n2. **Review of Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and intended solely for informational purposes.\n   - They uniformly identify no suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, justified because the code performs only informational output with no security-sensitive operations.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are reported or evident.\n   - The code is not doing anything that warrants a higher risk score.\n   - The logic and reasoning in the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, the scores seem appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments are justified and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No further action or escalation is needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the observed code behavior and the consensus of the reports.",
