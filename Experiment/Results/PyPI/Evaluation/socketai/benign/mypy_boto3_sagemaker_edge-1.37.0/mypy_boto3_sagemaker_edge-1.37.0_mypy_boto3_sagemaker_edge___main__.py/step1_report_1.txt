  "purpose": "CLI utility to display package information and version details for a specific Python package.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for outputting info",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write potentially outputs sensitive or unintended info, but in this context it is benign",
  "flows": "Command-line input in sys.argv determines whether print_version or print_info executes; output flows to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that provides package info and version upon command. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs data via sys.stdout.write. There are no external network connections, no data leaks, and no suspicious code patterns. The functions are simple, and the main function handles basic argument parsing to display info or version. No security issues or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for informational output. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for a CLI utility.",
