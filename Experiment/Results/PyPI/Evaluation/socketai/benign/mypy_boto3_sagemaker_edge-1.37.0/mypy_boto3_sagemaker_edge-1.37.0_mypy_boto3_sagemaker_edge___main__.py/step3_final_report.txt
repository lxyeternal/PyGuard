  "purpose": "Provides package information and version details via command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (if '--version') leads to printing version; otherwise, prints package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static output; no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments. It uses standard library functions with no external dependencies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The logic is direct, with no network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
