  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data, which is safe; no external data sinks or network communication present",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check flows to printing version, otherwise prints package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling, no external network calls or system modifications",
  "analysis": "The script simply provides informational output based on command-line input. It reads input via sys.argv and outputs via sys.stdout. No external data sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical CLI pattern without suspicious constructs or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package info or version. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
