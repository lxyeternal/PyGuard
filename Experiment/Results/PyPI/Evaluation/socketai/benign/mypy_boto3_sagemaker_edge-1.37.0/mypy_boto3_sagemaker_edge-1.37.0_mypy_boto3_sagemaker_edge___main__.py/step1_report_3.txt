  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a Python package related to boto3 SagemakerEdgeManager.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs information)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data to stdout), sys.argv (reads user input/arguments)",
  "flows": "User input via command-line argument -> checks for '--version' -> calls print_version or print_info -> outputs to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected; the output content appears informational and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to print package information and version. It checks command-line arguments for '--version' and prints corresponding info. No external data inputs, no network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious code. The code is straightforward, mainly performing output based on static strings. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated code. The code's structure and content are consistent with a benign CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely through standard output and command-line input with static data.",
