  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources' declare_namespace function.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkg_resources' module, invocation of declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to files.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' -> call to declare_namespace(__name__) with no data flow beyond namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for namespace declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace with __name__, which is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code is static, simple, and used in packaging contexts. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign namespace declaration used in Python packaging. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
