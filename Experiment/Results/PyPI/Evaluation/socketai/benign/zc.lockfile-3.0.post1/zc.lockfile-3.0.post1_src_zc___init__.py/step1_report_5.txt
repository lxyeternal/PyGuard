  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; this is a simple namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known packaging module and declares a namespace, which is standard practice in Python package development. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communications, or data manipulation that could be malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this small snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for organizing large packages and does not contain any malicious behavior.",
