  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for the current module using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The import statement which loads 'pkg_resources' and the namespace declaration",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' followed by namespace declaration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package declaration; no unusual or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace, which is a common pattern in Python package development. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be to enable namespace packaging, which is benign. No anomalies or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard namespace declaration for Python packages and contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
