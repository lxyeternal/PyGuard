  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code simply declares a namespace without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the use of declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages, but it's less common in modern setups, potentially indicating an older pattern. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current module as a namespace package. This is a standard practice in Python packaging to allow multiple distributions to extend the same namespace. There are no apparent sources or sinks of untrusted data, nor any suspicious code behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving only a packaging purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
