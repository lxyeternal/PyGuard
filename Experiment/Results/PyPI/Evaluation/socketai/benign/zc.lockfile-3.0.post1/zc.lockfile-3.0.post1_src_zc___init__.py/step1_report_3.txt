  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Import and call declare_namespace with __name__ as argument, no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the use of __import__ and declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls its 'declare_namespace' function with the current module's __name__. This is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python, facilitating package modularity. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and standard, with no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
