  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; the code only executes a namespace declaration",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'declare_namespace' indicates namespace package setup, which is standard practice; no unusual or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace package with the current module name. This is a common pattern in Python for defining namespace packages, especially in large modular projects. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity are evident. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or credential handling. It is a minimal, standard namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package declaration without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
