  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package 'zc.lockfile' with metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading files: README.rst, src/zc/lockfile/README.txt, CHANGES.rst",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data exposure detected.",
  "flows": "File reading functions load package documentation for setup; no flow from untrusted input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard setup script with no obfuscated elements or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os, setuptools), reads package documentation files, and calls setup() with package metadata and configuration. It performs no network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code follows common package setup patterns and does not include any potentially malicious or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
