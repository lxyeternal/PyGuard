{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package called 'zc.lockfile' with metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "File reading functions for 'README.rst', 'src/zc/lockfile/README.txt', and 'CHANGES.rst'; package metadata and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no execution of untrusted data, network operations, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading documentation files into the long_description variable, then into the setup() function, which uses this data for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard setup script practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup file using setuptools. It reads multiple documentation files to assemble the long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The only data processing involves file reading and configuration passing to setuptools, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard distribution configuration.",
