  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading static documentation files and configuring package metadata without executing any dynamic or untrusted code.",
  "sources": "File reads of README.rst, src/zc/lockfile/README.txt, CHANGES.rst for long description assembly.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Reading static files to assemble long_description, then passing data to setuptools.setup() without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static file reads and package configuration, typical for Python packaging. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. All dependencies are standard. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to best practices. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriately zero, and confidence is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
