  "purpose": "Utility functions for GSSAPI extension import, property creation, encoding management, and error handling decorators and classes for security context management.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import paths based on extension names, attribute access for context objects, input parameters for functions, class attributes for error states.",
  "sinks": "Property getters invoking _inquire, exception raising and traceback manipulation, global encoding variable, return of tokens or error objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (extension name, property names, encoding), dynamic import of modules, attribute access for context properties, exception handling and traceback adjustments, return of tokens or errors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with string concatenation, traceback manipulation in exception handling, global mutable encoding variable.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard patterns for plugin-like dynamic extension loading, property creation, and error handling via decorators. Traceback manipulation could be used to obscure error origins but is common in error management. The global encoding variable is typical for configurability. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The dynamic import could pose a risk if untrusted input is used, but in controlled environments, this is standard. The traceback adjustments are typical for error handling and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for managing GSSAPI security contexts, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of dynamic import and traceback manipulation are standard in such libraries but should be used cautiously if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the security risk is minimal.",
