{
  "purpose": "This code defines a GSSAPI Mechanism class for managing security mechanisms, including creation, retrieval, and property access related to GSSAPI mechanisms and their attributes.",
  "sources": "Imports from external gssapi modules and functions, class initialization parameters, properties fetching mechanism attributes, class methods for mechanism retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Methods and properties that return sensitive data such as mechanism names, descriptions, attribute sets, and mechanism lists.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., mechanism names, attributes) flows into class methods which query external modules or RFC extensions, and output data such as mechanism descriptions, supported attributes, and mechanism lists.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external RFC extension functions which may raise NotImplementedError if not supported; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; no network calls or file system access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing GSSAPI mechanisms with properties and class methods for creation and querying mechanisms. It relies heavily on external modules and RFC extensions to gather mechanism data. The code appears to implement standard data access patterns without executing external commands or network requests directly. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The use of external extensions and raising of NotImplementedError based on support indicates handling of optional features, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of GSSAPI mechanism management with no signs of malicious intent. It performs data retrieval and formatting without any suspicious behavior or malicious logic. The code appears safe for use.",
