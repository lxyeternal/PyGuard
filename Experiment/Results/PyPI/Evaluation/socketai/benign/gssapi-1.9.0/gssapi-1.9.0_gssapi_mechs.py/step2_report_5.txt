  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious intent, no suspicious operations, no obfuscation, and assigns a malware score of 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that the code is a straightforward class wrapping GSSAPI mechanisms, relying on external extensions and utilities. No network, file, or data exfiltration activities are evident.\n- **Verdict:** The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the absence of malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and standard use of external functions.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. No signs of malware or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code is mainly data access and management, with reliance on external functions and no malicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity or malicious intent detected. The code is a typical API wrapper.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard API wrapper, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's structure and behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, describes the code as a legitimate API wrapper with no malicious intent, no network or file operations, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code's purpose and structure.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** All reports agree that there's no malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose as a wrapper for security mechanisms, the low risk score (~0.1 to 0.2) is justified.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The code interacts with external extensions (rfc5587, rfc5801), which could be a vector if these extensions are malicious or compromised. However, the code itself just calls functions and raises NotImplementedError if unsupported—no malicious activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured API wrapper for GSSAPI mechanisms.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows.\n- External extension calls are standard in GSSAPI implementations and are handled safely.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, given the code's role and external dependencies, but always consider supply chain risks if external extensions are compromised)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears benign. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk remains minimal based on this analysis.",
