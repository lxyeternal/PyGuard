  "purpose": "Defines a GSSAPI Mechanism class with methods for querying and instantiating mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Uses external modules and functions, no suspicious data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Internal data processing, no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "Straightforward wrapper around GSSAPI, no malicious behavior detected. External extensions are used with proper error handling, and no external network or file I/O is present. The code is well-structured and typical for such an API wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a GSSAPI mechanism interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
