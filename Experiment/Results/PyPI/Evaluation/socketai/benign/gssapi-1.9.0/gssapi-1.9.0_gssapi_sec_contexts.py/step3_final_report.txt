{
  "purpose": "A high-level wrapper class for managing GSSAPI security contexts, providing methods for message signing, verification, wrapping, unwrapping, encryption, decryption, token processing, exporting, and context inquiry.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as tokens, names, credentials, and internal API calls to low-level GSSAPI functions like import_sec_context, accept_sec_context, init_sec_context, and message processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Low-level GSSAPI functions processing untrusted tokens and messages, such as accept_sec_context, init_sec_context, get_mic, verify_mic, wrap, unwrap, and context inquiry functions.",
  "flows": "Untrusted tokens flow into context processing functions; message signing, wrapping, and encryption functions produce outputs; context state and credentials are managed internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is a straightforward high-level API wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a GSSAPI high-level context management class. It correctly handles context creation, token processing, message security, and context export/import. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The functions used are standard API calls, and the code includes proper error handling and documentation. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. It processes untrusted input tokens in a typical manner for security contexts, which is expected and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a GSSAPI security context wrapper with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting the inherent risks in processing untrusted tokens but nothing malicious in the code itself.",
