  "purpose": "Defines a high-level Python class for managing GSSAPI names with support for RFC 6680 extensions, including name import, export, canonicalization, comparison, and attribute handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from gssapi.raw (names, NameType, oids), gssapi._utils (import_gssapi_extension), and collections.abc (MutableMapping, Iterable).",
  "sinks": "Methods that convert names to bytes/strings, import/export tokens, and attribute get/set/delete operations. No direct sinks for untrusted external input are evident.",
  "flows": "Name initialization and conversion flows through rname.import_name, display_name, export_name, and attribute access via _NameAttributeMapping.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external extension imports (_utils.import_gssapi_extension), optional handling of RFC 6680 support, and attribute mapping class which manipulates name attributes via external functions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed. Exception raising for unsupported features is standard. No obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a wrapper around low-level GSSAPI name objects, providing high-level methods for name creation, comparison, display, export, and attribute management. It carefully checks for support of RFC 6680 extensions before calling extension-specific functions, raising appropriate exceptions if not supported. The attribute mapping class uses standard dict-like methods to access and modify name attributes via external extension functions. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns are identified. The code primarily relies on external libraries for core functionality, with proper exception handling for unsupported features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured high-level wrapper for GSSAPI name management with extension support. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activity is detected. It mainly facilitates name handling with extensions, with appropriate safeguards for unsupported features.",
