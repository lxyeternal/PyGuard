  "purpose": "Define a high-level Python class for handling GSSAPI Names with support for RFC 6680 attributes, name import/export, and comparison.",
  "sources": "Imports from gssapi.raw (names, oids, utils), internal extension imports, class methods reading attributes, exporting, importing, and displaying names, attribute management.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through display_name (which exposes name strings), export (which outputs name tokens), attribute get/set/delete (which manipulate name attributes).",
  "flows": "Name creation/import → display_name / display_as → attribute retrieval / modification → export/import tokens.",
  "anomalies": "Use of rname_rfc6680 extension if available; potential reliance on external extension modules; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a high-level Name class extending low-level gssapi names, providing methods for creating, comparing, displaying, exporting, and managing attributes. It conditionally supports RFC 6680 extensions through optional imports, with appropriate error handling. The display_name and export_name methods reveal internal name data, but this is standard for such APIs. The attribute mapping class provides dict-like access to name attributes, with proper encoding handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured GSSAPI name handling implementation, with support for optional extensions, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard high-level wrapper for GSSAPI Name handling with optional RFC 6680 extensions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. It handles sensitive data cautiously, exposing internal names only through standard methods. No evidence of supply chain attacks or malware is present.",
