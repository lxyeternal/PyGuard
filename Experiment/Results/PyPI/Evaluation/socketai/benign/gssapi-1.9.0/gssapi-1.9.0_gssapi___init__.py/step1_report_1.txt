  "purpose": "Provides high-level API abstractions for GSSAPI functionality, including class imports and API documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from the gssapi package and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions but does not process or handle external input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, module-level comments, and an __all__ declaration. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or potentially risky operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The purpose appears to be API exposure and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward API wrapper setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to contain malware or pose security threats.",
