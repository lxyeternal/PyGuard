{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a high-level API interface for GSSAPI bindings, providing class imports and module setup for secure communication.",
  "sources": "Import statements from gssapi modules and internal utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Imports from various gssapi modules are collected and exposed via __all__ for external use; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code consists mainly of import statements and module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module that imports various components of a GSSAPI library and exposes them for external use. There are no data processing, user input handling, or external communications. The presence of imports from a secure, documented library does not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard high-level API wrapper for GSSAPI, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as an interface layer, importing and exporting classes and functions. Therefore, it is considered safe.",
