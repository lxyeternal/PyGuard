{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a high-level API wrapper for GSSAPI, importing and exposing core classes, types, and constants for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal and external gssapi modules, including platform-specific configuration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not contain runtime data flows or data processing paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup module that imports various classes and constants related to GSSAPI and exposes them via __all__. It includes a platform-specific import, which is normal for cross-platform libraries. There are no dynamic operations, network communications, or data handling that could introduce security issues. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate it is benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API setup module for GSSAPI, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
