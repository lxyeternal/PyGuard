  "purpose": "This code provides high-level API bindings for GSSAPI, defining imports and API classes for use in applications that implement security via GSSAPI.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various gssapi modules, including gssapi._win_config, gssapi.raw.types, gssapi.raw.oids, gssapi.creds, gssapi.names, gssapi.sec_contexts, gssapi.mechs, and gssapi._utils.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; this code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is identifiable; this is purely module import and API exposure code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code solely imports modules and defines the __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various modules related to GSSAPI security mechanisms and exports selected classes and functions. It does not execute any logic, process input, or handle data; thus, it presents no security concerns or malicious behavior. The presence of a Windows-specific configuration import does not imply malicious intent but is part of normal platform-specific setup. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of API bindings and module imports for a GSSAPI library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code appears safe and typical for a Python package providing security abstractions.",
