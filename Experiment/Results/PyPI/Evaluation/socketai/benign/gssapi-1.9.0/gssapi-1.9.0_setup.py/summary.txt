  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration for the 'gssapi' package, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary concern is the reliance on environment variables and dynamic loading, which could be manipulated in a compromised supply chain, but this is a common aspect of build scripts. Overall, the code is safe, unobfuscated, and does not contain malware."
