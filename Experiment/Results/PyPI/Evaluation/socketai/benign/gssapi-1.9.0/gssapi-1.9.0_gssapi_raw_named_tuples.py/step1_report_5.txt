{
  "purpose": "This code defines multiple data structures (NamedTuples) for handling GSSAPI security-related information and operations, including credentials, context, and attributes.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and types from external libraries (gssapi.raw.* and typing), and defines classes with no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling mechanisms are present. No network, file, or external data output operations are visible.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks, as the code only contains class definitions and type annotations without processing logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The code is purely declarative, defining data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data models for GSSAPI security elements, with type annotations and docstrings, and imports external modules for types. There is no runtime or malicious behavior, no data processing, and no network or file operations. It appears to be a standard, non-sensitive, and non-executable set of class definitions used for security context management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security vulnerabilities within its scope. It is a straightforward set of data structure definitions for GSSAPI operations.",
