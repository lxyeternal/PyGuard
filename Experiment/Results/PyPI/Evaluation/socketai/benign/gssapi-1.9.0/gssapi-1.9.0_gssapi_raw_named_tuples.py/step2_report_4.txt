  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently state that the code is solely defining data structures (NamedTuples) for GSSAPI credential and context management.\n- No dynamic logic, data processing, external communication, or runtime behavior is present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code elements are identified.\n- The imports are standard and used solely for type annotations.\n- The code appears to be part of an API or SDK, intended for internal use or testing.\n\n**Confirmations and observations:**\n\n- The code does not contain any executable logic that could be exploited.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The type annotations and structure are consistent with typical API design.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` for conditional imports is standard practice to avoid runtime dependencies.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which is justified because the code is purely structural.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- No issues are evident. The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- The only minor note is that the code relies on external modules (`gssapi.raw.*`) but does not process or handle data from untrusted sources, so no security concern arises from that.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security-risk elements.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Security risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is purely declarative, defining data structures for GSSAPI operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign set of data structure definitions for GSSAPI credentials and contexts. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
