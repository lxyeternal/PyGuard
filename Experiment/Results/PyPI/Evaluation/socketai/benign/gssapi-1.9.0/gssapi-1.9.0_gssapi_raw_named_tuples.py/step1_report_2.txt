{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple NamedTuple classes for handling GSSAPI credential, context, and name information, mainly for secure communication management.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; all data structures are statically defined within the module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or operations that process untrusted input data or send data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures without processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type annotations and references to internal GSSAPI components, but no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining structured data types for GSSAPI credential and context management. There are no functions executing logic, no external data handling, no network operations, and no indications of malicious behavior. The use of type annotations and references to GSSAPI internals appear consistent with typical SDK or API design. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of data structure definitions for GSSAPI credentials and context information, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard API interface module with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
