{
  "purpose": "Define various NamedTuple classes representing GSSAPI credential and context results, attributes, and related data structures.",
  "sources": "Imported modules such as gssapi.raw.oids, gssapi.raw.types, and conditional import of gssapi if TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted input/output handling present; code is purely data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow from sources to sinks; no data processing or manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines type annotations and data structures using NamedTuple for GSSAPI-related data. Imports are standard, and there is no execution logic, data handling, or external input processing. The use of TYPE_CHECKING prevents import-time dependencies, which is common for type hints. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data structure definitions for GSSAPI operations with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any processing, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. Overall, it appears to be benign and intended for internal type annotation and documentation.",
