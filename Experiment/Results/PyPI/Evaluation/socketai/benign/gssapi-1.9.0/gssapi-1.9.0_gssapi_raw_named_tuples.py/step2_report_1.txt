  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Defines data structures for GSSAPI credentials and contexts.  \n- Behavior: No executable logic, data flow, or external communication.  \n- Anomalies: None detected.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, purely structural.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.0 (appropriate given no active behavior)  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining GSSAPI data models.  \n- Behavior: No processing, no data handling beyond static definitions.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Conclusion: Benign.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.0  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Defines GSSAPI data structures.  \n- Behavior: No data processing or external communication.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.0  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Data models for GSSAPI security info.  \n- Behavior: Only class definitions, no runtime logic.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Conclusion: Benign.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.0  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to others, defining data structures.  \n- Behavior: No active or malicious behavior.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.0  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that only defines data structures (NamedTuples) for GSSAPI credential and context management.  \n- **Behavior:** No executable logic, data processing, network communication, or external data handling.  \n- **Malicious Indicators:** None—no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Security Risks:** Given the purely declarative nature, no security vulnerabilities are evident.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no active security risk, just data definitions)  \n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, well-structured, and intended for internal use as part of a larger GSSAPI implementation or testing framework.**",
