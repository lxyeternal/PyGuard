  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code to assess the security implications.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, defining data structures with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication.\n   - The code only imports modules, defines NamedTuple classes, and uses type annotations for GSSAPI-related data.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - No runtime code, dynamic execution, or data manipulation occurs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is solely for data modeling.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent, as the code is straightforward.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low, which is justified since there are no active security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The code makes no assumptions about external data or inputs.\n   - It relies on external gssapi modules, but that is standard and not suspicious.\n   - No signs of malicious assumptions or hidden behaviors.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - Given the nature of the code, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Security Assessment**:\n   - The code is a benign, well-structured set of data definitions for GSSAPI operations.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score**: Remain at 0.\n\n**My personal estimate** aligns with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0**.\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, safe, and non-malicious component intended for use within a larger GSSAPI implementation or testing framework.",
