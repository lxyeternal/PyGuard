  "purpose": "Define various NamedTuple classes representing the results and attributes related to GSSAPI credential, security context, and attribute handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely structural class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of string annotations and import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions using NamedTuple for modeling GSSAPI-related data structures. Imports are from standard and gssapi packages. No data processing, input handling, or network operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of data models with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of data structure definitions for GSSAPI operations with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any data handling or external communication that could be exploited. The overall security risk is minimal.",
