{
  "purpose": "Define various NamedTuple classes for handling GSSAPI credential and security context data.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard typing module, gssapi.raw modules, and conditional import of gssapi for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only defines data structures and imports.",
  "flows": "No executable flow; only type annotations and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of data structure definitions using NamedTuple to represent various GSSAPI-related results and attributes. It imports modules from gssapi.raw for type annotations, and includes conditional import for type checking purposes. No dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external communication occurs. No code injection, credential theft, or malicious behavior evident. The absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns indicates a purely structural module.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of data definitions for GSSAPI credential and context management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for use as part of a larger GSSAPI implementation or testing framework.",
