  "purpose": "Defines data structures for GSSAPI credentials, contexts, and related information using NamedTuples.",
  "sources": "Imports from gssapi.raw and type checking modules; class definitions for data models.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, external input, or output operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely declarative data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for GSSAPI credential and context data, with no executable logic or external communication. Imports are standard, and the structure is consistent with API or SDK design. No security vulnerabilities, malicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the risk score reflects the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and poses no security threat. It is part of a GSSAPI implementation or testing framework, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
