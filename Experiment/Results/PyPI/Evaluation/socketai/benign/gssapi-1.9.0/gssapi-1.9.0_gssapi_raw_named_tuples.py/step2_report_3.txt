  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**  \nThe code is purely composed of class definitions using NamedTuple for GSSAPI credential and context data. It imports standard modules and gssapi.raw components, with conditional imports for type checking. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code itself.\n\n**2. Logical flaws, errors, or suspicious patterns:**  \nThe code is straightforward, well-structured, and standard for defining data models. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected. The use of type annotations and docstrings aligns with good practices.  \n**Conclusion:** No logical flaws or suspicious patterns.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to issues:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, a security risk of 0, and an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence levels are high, indicating consistent assessment.  \n**Suggestion:** Scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's content.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores:**  \nSince there's no runtime logic, external data handling, or network activity, the risk scores should remain minimal. The code is purely declarative.  \n**Conclusion:** No justification exists for elevating risk scores above 0.5.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \nThe malware score is correctly set to 0 across reports, as there's no malicious activity or payload.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \nNo claims about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as structural and non-malicious.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \nScores are consistent with the benign, structural nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\nThis code is a standard set of data structure definitions for GSSAPI operations. It appears to be part of an SDK or internal API layer, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context in which such code is used. If integrated into a larger system, review the entire codebase for any runtime or external interactions. But based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
