  "purpose": "High-level API wrapper for GSSAPI credentials management, including acquire, import, export, store, and impersonate functions.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as token, name, store dicts; external extension modules ('cred_imp_exp', 's4u', 'cred_store', 'rfc5588') used for extended functionality.",
  "sinks": "Exported credentials via 'export()', stored credentials via 'store()', and credential data passed to external extension functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into extension functions or internal methods; exported credentials can be serialized; stored credentials are written into external stores.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy reliance on dynamically imported external extension modules which could execute arbitrary code or access system resources; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, high-level API for managing GSSAPI credentials. It uses external extension modules for extended capabilities such as import/export and impersonation, which could be malicious if compromised. The 'export' method serializes credentials, which could be exploited if untrusted data is unpickled. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary risk stems from trusting external modules; the core code itself is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate credential management interface with no inherent malicious behavior. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external extension modules, which could be exploited if malicious. Overall, the code is safe if external dependencies are secure and from trusted sources.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
