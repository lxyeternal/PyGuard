  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the code's security posture, consistency of scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code solely defines custom exception classes for the gssapi library.\n- It imports exceptions from external modules and sets up formatted error messages.\n- No data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The wildcard import from `gssapi.raw.exceptions` is noted but not inherently malicious; explicit imports are preferable but not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code does **not** contain any security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code.\n   - It is purely definitional, establishing exception classes with message formatting.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent; they correctly identify that the code is straightforward and safe.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The mention of wildcard imports as a potential concern is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No changes are necessary; they reflect the code's benign nature accurately.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a high risk score.\n   - This is correct, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign purpose.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as safe.\n   - The mention of wildcard imports is a minor style concern but not malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable assessments are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (Code is straightforward and well-structured)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (No security risks identified)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is purely for defining exception classes.\n- No dynamic, network, or data processing logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- Import practices are standard, albeit with a wildcard import, which is a style concern but not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0.0**.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                 |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0             | No malicious activity or code behavior                          |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0             | Clear, straightforward class definitions                        |\n| Security Risk  | 0.0             | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or suspicious constructs      |\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's benign nature and appropriate scoring.",
