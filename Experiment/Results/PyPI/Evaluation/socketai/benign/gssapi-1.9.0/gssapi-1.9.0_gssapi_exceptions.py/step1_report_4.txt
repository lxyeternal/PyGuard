{
  "purpose": "This code defines high-level custom exception classes for the gssapi library, providing structured error handling and messaging.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data; it only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code only establishes exception classes and their messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The import statements include wildcard imports from a known library, which could be discouraged but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from gssapi.raw.exceptions and gssapi.raw.misc, then defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. These classes are designed to generate formatted error messages. The implementation is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The wildcard import from gssapi.raw.exceptions is a potential concern but not malicious; it is a common practice in some modules, though explicit imports are preferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely provides exception class definitions for error handling in a gssapi context. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this fragment.",
