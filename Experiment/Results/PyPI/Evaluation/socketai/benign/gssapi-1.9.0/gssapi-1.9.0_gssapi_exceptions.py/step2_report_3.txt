  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as a set of exception class definitions for the gssapi library, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. They note the code's straightforward, standard structure, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The only minor concern raised is the use of wildcard imports, which is a coding style issue but not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- **Confirmed:** The code matches the description. It only defines exception classes, imports external exceptions, and formats error messages.\n- **No malicious or suspicious activity detected.**\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and lacks malicious intent.\n- The mention of wildcard imports is noted but not considered a security concern.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes in reasoning are apparent.\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The scoring seems reasonable and consistent.\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n- All scores are 0 or very close to 0, indicating no security risk, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified** given the evidence—no malicious behavior, no data leaks, no external communication, and the code is purely for exception class definitions.\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Justification**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- **No malicious activity is present or implied.** The code only defines classes with formatted messages, no code execution, network activity, or code injection.\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n- All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content.\n- The wildcard import could be a stylistic concern but not malicious; thus, the absence of malware or obfuscation is justified.\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n- The scores align well with the analysis: all are low or zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n- Confidence levels match the thoroughness of the review.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks, data leaks, or malicious activities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for the gssapi library. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Accept the current evaluation. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
