{
  "purpose": "Define custom high-level API exception classes for the gssapi library.",
  "sources": "The code imports exceptions from gssapi.raw.exceptions and gssapi.raw.misc, and defines new exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; the code only defines classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input processing occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes with message formatting for error handling within the gssapi library. It imports external exceptions, and the classes use standard Python exception inheritance with no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or network activity. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and lacks obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional for exception handling and does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activities. It is safe and standard for error management in a Python package.",
