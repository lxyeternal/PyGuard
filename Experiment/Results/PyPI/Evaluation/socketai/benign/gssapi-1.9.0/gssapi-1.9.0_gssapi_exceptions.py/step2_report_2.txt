  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   The code solely defines exception classes for the gssapi library, with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. All reports agree that the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of suspicious or malicious activities. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malware.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**  \n   The only minor point is the use of wildcard import `from gssapi.raw.exceptions import *`, which is generally discouraged because it can pollute the namespace and reduce code clarity. However, this is a coding style concern, not a security issue or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. No malicious activity is evident.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Also 0, as there's no obfuscation or hidden code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports give a 0, which aligns with the absence of security risks.\n\n4. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code does not handle untrusted input, does not perform network operations, and does not contain malicious logic. The wildcard import is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is purely definitional for exception handling, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the wildcard import could be improved by explicit imports for clarity, it does not impact security. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues present.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n- The code is safe and standard for error handling in a Python library.",
