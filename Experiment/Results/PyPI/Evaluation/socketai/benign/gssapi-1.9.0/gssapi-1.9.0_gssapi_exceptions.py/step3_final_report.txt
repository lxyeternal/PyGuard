{
  "purpose": "Defines custom high-level exception classes for the gssapi library, providing formatted error messages.",
  "sources": "Import statements from gssapi.raw.exceptions and gssapi.raw.misc; class initializations; message formatting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no external communication or code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only defines classes; no data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from gssapi.raw.exceptions; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes exception classes with formatted messages, importing external exceptions. It contains no dynamic behavior, data processing, network activity, or obfuscated code. The wildcard import is a style concern but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is purely definitional, and it does not interact with untrusted sources or perform any operations that could be malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for the gssapi library. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
