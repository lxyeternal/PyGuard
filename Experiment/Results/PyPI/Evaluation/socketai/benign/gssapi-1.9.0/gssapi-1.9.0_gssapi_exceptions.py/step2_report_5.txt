  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Define custom high-level exception classes for gssapi.  \n- Findings: No data flow, no external input, no suspicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Purely definitional, safe, standard.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to above, define high-level exceptions.  \n- Findings: No external data, no malicious activity, straightforward class definitions.  \n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: No external input, no suspicious patterns, standard exception classes.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Define high-level exceptions, similar to others.  \n- Findings: No external data, no malicious code, wildcard import from gssapi.raw.exceptions noted but not malicious.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious intent or security risks.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, defining GSSAPI exception classes.  \n- Findings: No external data, no suspicious behavior, straightforward class definitions.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious activity or security risks.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is solely defining exception classes, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware/malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** None identified.\n- **Potential concern:** Wildcard import from `gssapi.raw.exceptions` in report 4, which could be discouraged but is not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is purely definitional and has no security implications.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The scores given by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, safe implementation of custom exception classes for the gssapi library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- No further action needed.",
