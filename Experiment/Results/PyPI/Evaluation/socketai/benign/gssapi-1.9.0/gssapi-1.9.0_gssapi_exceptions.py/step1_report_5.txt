  "purpose": "Define high-level exception classes for GSSAPI-related errors, including general errors, unknown usage errors, and encryption errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only internal exception message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; the code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for GSSAPI errors, with formatted error messages. It imports from a GSSAPI raw exceptions module but does not execute any risky operations, network calls, or handle untrusted input. There are no obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a GSSAPI context. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
