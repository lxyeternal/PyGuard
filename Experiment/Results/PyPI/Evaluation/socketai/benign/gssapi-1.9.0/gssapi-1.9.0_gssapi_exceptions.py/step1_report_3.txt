{
  "purpose": "Defines high-level API custom exceptions for the gssapi library, including error messages and initialization logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from gssapi.raw.exceptions and gssapi.raw.misc; no input or external data sources are read within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving sources or sinks are present, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly defines exception classes with standard initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception modules from gssapi.raw and defines custom exception classes for error handling. These classes include string formatting for error messages and optional attributes. There is no evidence of input handling, external communication, or suspicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for a Python exception module, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in gssapi, with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks detected.",
