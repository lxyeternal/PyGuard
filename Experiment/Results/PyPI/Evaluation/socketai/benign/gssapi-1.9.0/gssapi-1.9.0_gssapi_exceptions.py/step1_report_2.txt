{
  "purpose": "Define high-level API exception classes for the gssapi library, providing custom error messages and handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input; the code defines classes and methods only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no suspicious or malicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for error handling within a high-level API. It imports necessary modules, defines custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, and sets up formatted error messages. There is no user input processing, no external data handling, and no execution of dynamic code, network access, or data leaks. The code appears to be straightforward, purpose-specific, and free of malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to provide error messaging within a larger gssapi library context and does not perform any harmful actions.",
