  "flows": "Import modules -> call to BackgroundMesh3d.initialize()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and calls an initialization function. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The initialize() method's internal behavior is unknown but likely standard setup. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is minimal and typical for module setup routines, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization routine with no indicators of malicious activity or security issues. The current scores are appropriate, though the risk score could be lowered to zero given the lack of any suspicious behavior.",
