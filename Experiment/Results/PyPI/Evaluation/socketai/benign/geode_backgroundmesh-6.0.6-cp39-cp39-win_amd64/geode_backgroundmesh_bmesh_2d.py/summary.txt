  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard initialization routine for a geometric processing library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose."
