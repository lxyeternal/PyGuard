  "purpose": "Module initializer importing functions and classes from local modules 'bmesh_2d' and 'bmesh_3d'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no data flow or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with standard import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with a copyright comment. It does not process external data, connect to networks, or execute untrusted code. The code is minimal, transparent, and typical for a package initializer. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code's purpose appears to be providing an interface to mesh processing functionalities. The assessments across reports are accurate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
