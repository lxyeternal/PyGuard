  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from local modules 'bmesh_2d' and 'bmesh_3d', likely for 2D and 3D mesh processing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.bmesh_2d and .bmesh_3d).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data outputs, network calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only performs module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no unusual code patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules. There are no data inputs, network connections, or suspicious constructs. The presence of licensing comments indicates proper attribution but does not affect security. Since the code only imports modules, there are no observable malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, functioning solely to import internal modules for further use. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
