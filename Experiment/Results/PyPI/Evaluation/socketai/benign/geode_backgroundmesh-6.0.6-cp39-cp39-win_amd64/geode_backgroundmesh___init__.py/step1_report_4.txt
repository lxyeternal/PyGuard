{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to 2D and 3D mesh processing, likely for geometric or graphical computations.",
  "sources": "The import statements import everything from local modules '.bmesh_2d' and '.bmesh_3d'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in the code; no untrusted data processing, network operations, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present; the code only performs module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with a copyright notice. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions. The lack of additional logic, data handling, or external interactions suggests benign behavior. No signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import with a copyright notice, appearing benign and intended for use in a larger, presumably legitimate project. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
