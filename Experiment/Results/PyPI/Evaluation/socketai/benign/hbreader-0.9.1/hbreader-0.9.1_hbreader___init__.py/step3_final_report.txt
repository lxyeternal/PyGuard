  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling various data sources such as URLs, files, strings, and file-like objects, including type detection, opening, and reading data with metadata management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as source strings, URLs, file handles, and in-memory streams; network responses; file system attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if untrusted sources are mishandled, but no direct data exfiltration or malicious data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Source inputs are detected and processed through type detection; data flows from network or file into memory buffers or returned strings; no external data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ssl._create_unverified_context() which disables SSL verification, a security misconfiguration but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for data source detection, opening, and reading, with proper resource management. The use of insecure SSL context is a security concern but not malicious. No signs of backdoors, data theft, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified given the security misconfiguration. The code's logic is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module with a security misconfiguration (disabling SSL verification). There is no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting the insecure SSL context but not malicious activity.",
