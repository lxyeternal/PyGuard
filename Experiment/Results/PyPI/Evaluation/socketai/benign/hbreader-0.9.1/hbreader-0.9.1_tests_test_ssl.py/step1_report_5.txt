  "purpose": "Unit testing SSL security and server access for local endpoints using hbopen.",
  "sources": "Reads data from local server endpoints via URLs using hbopen.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from server responses potentially processed or validated in tests.",
  "flows": "Input from URLs (local server endpoints) flows into hbopen, and data is read from the returned file objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs standard unit testing with local server checks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports unittest and URLError, then defines a test case that attempts to access local HTTP and HTTPS endpoints using hbopen. It handles URLError exceptions gracefully, indicating the test's purpose is to verify server accessibility. The test asserts that the HTTPS response begins with a specific byte sequence. No data leakage, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is observed. The use of local server endpoints suggests a controlled testing environment rather than malicious activity. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard unit testing of local server SSL security using hbopen. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code appears to be safe, intended for testing local server responses.",
