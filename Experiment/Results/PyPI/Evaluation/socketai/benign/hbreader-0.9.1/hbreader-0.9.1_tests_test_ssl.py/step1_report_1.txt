  "purpose": "Unit testing for SSL security by attempting to open HTTP and HTTPS local server connections",
  "sources": "hbopen function calls to 'http://localhost:...' and 'https://localhost:...'",
  "sinks": "The hbopen function potentially handles network data, but no untrusted user input appears to be processed or transmitted elsewhere",
  "flows": "Code flow from calling hbopen with URLs to reading data from the server, with no data flow from untrusted input to sensitive functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and standard for testing server accessibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unittest that verifies the ability to access local HTTP and HTTPS servers using the hbopen function. It handles the URLError exception gracefully and performs a minimal assertion on the response content. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign unit test for server accessibility over HTTP/HTTPS. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is very low.",
