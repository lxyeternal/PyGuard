  "purpose": "Unit test for verifying secure and insecure HTTP(S) access to a local server using hbopen.",
  "sources": "Reading URLs via hbopen for localhost at specified ports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink of untrusted data; the code reads from local URLs, primarily for testing server responses.",
  "flows": "URL requests (source) to the hbopen function, with a check for the response data in the HTTPS test.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code appears to be standard test code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward unit test by attempting to access a local server over HTTP and HTTPS using hbopen. It checks for server availability and verifies the response content in the HTTPS case. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The test is designed to validate server responses and does not involve any malicious or maliciously behaving code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test script for server accessibility and response verification, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
