  "purpose": "Unit testing for HTTPS and HTTP server access using hbreader's hbopen function",
  "sources": "Reading from local server URLs via hbopen, including localhost on specific ports",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; only file reading from local server",
  "flows": "Accessing local server URLs with hbopen; reading initial bytes from response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; simple network request tests",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic unit tests to verify server responses over HTTP and HTTPS on localhost. It uses hbopen to fetch JSON-LD schema files from local ports. The try-except handles server unavailability gracefully. No obfuscation or suspicious control flow present. The code does not send data externally or execute malicious commands. The use of local URLs and simple assertion suggests a benign purpose focused on connection verification.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a straightforward, non-malicious unit test script for server connectivity verification. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
