{
  "purpose": "Unit test verifying local HTTP and HTTPS server accessibility using hbopen.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local server responses via hbopen calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; responses are only read locally, no data exfiltration or external transmission.",
  "flows": "Source: hbopen network calls to localhost; Sink: reading server responses with next(f).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that attempts to connect to local servers over HTTP and HTTPS, handling connection errors gracefully. It performs minimal assertions on the response data. No suspicious or malicious logic, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The data flow is limited to local network responses, with no external or untrusted input processing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, controlled testing purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and justified given its simple, local server testing purpose.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
