{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign, standard Python package or script with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Standard imports, function definitions, and data handling points; no external or untrusted input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous functions, network calls, or data leaks observed; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; code flow appears straightforward and benign.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected; code structure is typical and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with standard structure and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Confidence is high (0.9) when code is present and appears benign. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The security risk is low (0.2), reflecting cautious assessment given limited context but no evidence of threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk and no malware presence. The confidence level is high, supporting the conclusion that this dependency is safe for use.",
