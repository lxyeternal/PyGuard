  "purpose": "Configure package setup with setuptools and pbr.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code executes static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python setup script that imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with fixed parameters. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The structure and content align with common packaging practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging boilerplate with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
