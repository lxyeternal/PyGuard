  "purpose": "Define a base class for HVAC API classes, providing common functionality and structure.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the class with an adapter parameter.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of VaultApiBase with an adapter; no data flows outside constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition using Python's ABCMeta for an abstract base class. It initializes with an adapter object meant for HTTP requests, which appears to be a dependency injection pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The code is minimal, clean, and typical for an API base class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign base class intended for API subclasses. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
