{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in a Vault-related API or application.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class definitions and class variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code defines error classes and a mapping method; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors. The _STATUS_EXCEPTION_MAP is a static mapping, typical for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from VaultError. The main class VaultError constructs detailed error messages and provides a class method to map status codes to exceptions using a static dictionary. The exception classes are straightforward and used for specific HTTP error codes or error conditions. No untrusted input handling, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to serve as part of an error handling framework within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions and error mapping for API response handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The static mapping and class structures are typical and do not raise concerns.",
