  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and Vault-related errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializers, class method 'from_status' that maps status codes to exception classes.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in 'from_status' method that instantiate and return specific error objects.",
  "flows": "Input status_code in 'from_status' -> mapping to specific exception class -> instantiation and return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class instantiation based on status codes is standard; no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Vault or HTTP context. The 'VaultError' class and its subclasses are used to encapsulate different error conditions. The 'from_status' class method maps HTTP status codes to specific exception classes, enabling dynamic error raising. All exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from 'VaultError'. The code does not perform any input/output operations, network communications, or data processing that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dynamic class lookup in 'from_status' is a common pattern for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with a status code-to-error mapping. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for error handling in Python applications.",
