{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various Vault API error responses.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines classes and mappings without external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no output or data leaks are directly produced by this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, mainly used for handling API error responses. The from_status class method maps HTTP status codes to specific exception classes using a predefined dictionary. The implementation uses standard Python practices with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or external input processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads. The code appears to be a straightforward error handling module for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes intended for API error handling. It does not contain any malicious, suspicious, or security-risky elements. Overall, it appears safe and solely focused on structured error management.",
