{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Vault API interactions, with a focus on HTTP status code mapping.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__), class method (from_status), and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(message) which raises the base Exception with a message, and the retrieval of exception classes from _STATUS_EXCEPTION_MAP.",
  "flows": "Errors list from __init__ propagates as message; from_status retrieves and instantiates specific exception classes based on status code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for handling HTTP response errors from Vault. The __init__ method aggregates error messages and stores contextual info. The from_status class method maps HTTP status codes to specific exception classes. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no external data read, and no sinks like network or file operations. The code relies solely on standard class and method structures for error handling. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard for defining exception hierarchies, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of custom error classes for API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and does not pose supply chain threats.",
