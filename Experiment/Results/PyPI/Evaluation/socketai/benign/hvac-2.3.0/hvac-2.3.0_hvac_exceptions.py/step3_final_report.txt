{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling HTTP response errors from a Vault API, with a method to map status codes to exceptions.",
  "sources": "The __init__ method reads error details; from_status method reads the status_code parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external sinks; primarily internal error handling.",
  "flows": "Status code input in from_status maps to exception classes; error message construction in __init__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class hierarchy, static mapping, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign error handling framework with clear class hierarchy, no external data handling, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The from_status method uses a static dictionary for mapping, which is safe. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The exception classes are simple, and the overall structure is typical for API error management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard error handling module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments across the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
