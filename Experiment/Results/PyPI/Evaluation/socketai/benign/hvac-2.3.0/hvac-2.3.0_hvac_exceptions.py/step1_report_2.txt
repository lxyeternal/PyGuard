  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Vault API errors with structured error messages and mappings.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines error handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with a mapping for HTTP status codes to specific exception classes. The __init__ method consolidates error messages, and __str__ provides formatted error info. The from_status class method maps status codes to exception classes without external input or network activity. No use of environment variables, file I/O, or external data sources is present. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for handling API errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
