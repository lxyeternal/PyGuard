{
  "purpose": "This code imports the Client class from hvac.v1 and re-exports it via __all__, serving as a simple module re-export.",
  "sources": "Import statement from hvac.v1 module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import and export only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code performs a direct import of a class from an external library and exposes it via __all__. There are no data processing, user inputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The imported library is legitimate, and the code does not perform any network, file, or system operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal module re-export with no malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
