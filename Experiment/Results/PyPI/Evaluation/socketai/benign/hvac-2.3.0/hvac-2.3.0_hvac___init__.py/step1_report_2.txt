  "purpose": "The code imports the 'Client' class from the 'hvac.v1' module and defines '__all__' for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Client' from external module 'hvac.v1'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or source-to-sink paths observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and export definition, no credentials, code execution, or data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an '__all__' declaration. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or execute any logic that could be malicious. The imported module 'hvac' is a known library for HVAC system interaction, and merely importing a class does not indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, performing a standard import and export operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
