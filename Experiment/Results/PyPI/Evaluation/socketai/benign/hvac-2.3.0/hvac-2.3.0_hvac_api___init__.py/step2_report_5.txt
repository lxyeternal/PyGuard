  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues identified; the code is a simple import/export module.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any suspicious actions, network calls, or data handling. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; straightforward re-export of classes.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected; the code is a standard module.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; simple import/export.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; module that imports and exposes classes.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; standard import/export pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; thus, malware score should be 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, so 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely structural, importing known modules without any suspicious patterns, a risk score of 0 is justified across all reports.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No report suggests any potential vulnerability based on assumptions; all correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The scores are aligned with the code's functionality.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis. The code is a standard, safe module with no security concerns.",
