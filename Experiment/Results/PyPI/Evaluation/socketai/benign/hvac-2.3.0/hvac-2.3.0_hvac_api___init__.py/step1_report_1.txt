{
  "purpose": "This code provides an import structure for Vault API endpoint classes, likely to facilitate modular access to Vault's functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from the 'hvac.api' package, which may read or load external modules or classes related to Vault API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this snippet; it does not process untrusted input or perform network operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is primarily static import declarations; there are no runtime data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be straightforward imports and an __all__ declaration without suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the 'hvac.api' submodules related to Vault API functionalities and defines an explicit __all__ list for exports. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The structure is standard for organizing package exports. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The imports are from open-source modules that are standard for Vault API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that exports specific classes for Vault API interactions. It contains no suspicious or malicious elements, appears to be standard package organization code, and does not present any security risks.",
