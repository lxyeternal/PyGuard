  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from the 'hvac.api' package and defines an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'hvac.api' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or dynamic execution present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes related to Vault API endpoints and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The code is static, clear, and standard for organizing API class exports. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly assess this, and the current scores are appropriate.",
