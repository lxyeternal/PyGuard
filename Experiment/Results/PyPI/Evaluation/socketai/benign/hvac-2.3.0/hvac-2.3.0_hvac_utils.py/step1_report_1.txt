{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for error handling, parameter validation, deprecation warnings, environment variable access, URL formatting, and data processing, mainly to support a larger application interacting with Vault or similar systems.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (VAULT_TOKEN), user input parameters (via function arguments), file system (~/.vault-token), and URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables and files; formatting URLs; raising exceptions; issuing warnings; manipulating data structures.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable or file) -> data processing functions (e.g., get_token_from_env) -> usage in API requests or internal logic; parameters provided to decorated functions or validation functions -> exception raising or warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code mainly handles error raising, warnings, and data validation. The URL encoding process encodes user-supplied data but in a safe manner, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for handling errors, parameter deprecation warnings, validation, environment variable access, and URL formatting. No obfuscated code or malicious logic such as network exfiltration, system damage, or hidden backdoors is evident. Functions such as get_token_from_env() safely read tokens from environment variables or files, and URL formatting uses standard urllib.parse.quote. Deprecation warnings and error handling follow best practices. No suspicious external network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is detected. The functions are designed for safe parameter management, deprecation warnings, and environment access, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for common operations in a secure and maintainable manner. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to support a larger system interacting with Vault securely. There are no indicators of malware or malicious sabotage.",
