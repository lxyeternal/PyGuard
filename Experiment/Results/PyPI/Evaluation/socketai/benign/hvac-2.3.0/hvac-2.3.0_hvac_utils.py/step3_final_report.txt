{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for error handling, parameter validation, deprecation warnings, environment variable access, URL formatting, and data processing, primarily supporting Vault interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (VAULT_TOKEN), local file (~/.vault-token), function parameters, and input data for URL formatting and validation.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage through environment variables and token files; no network or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Reading token from environment or file; URL encoding user input; passing validated data; raising exceptions or warnings based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Standard practices are followed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for error handling, parameter aliasing, deprecation warnings, environment variable reading, URL escaping, and validation. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Token retrieval from environment and local files is typical in secure clients. URL encoding is correctly implemented to prevent injection. The deprecation and warning mechanisms follow best practices. Overall, the code is well-structured, secure, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low risk scores are justified by standard environment and file access patterns. No obfuscation or malicious activity is present.",
