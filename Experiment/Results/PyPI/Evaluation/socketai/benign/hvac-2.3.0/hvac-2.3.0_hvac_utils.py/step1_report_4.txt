  "purpose": "Utility functions for parameter handling, error raising, deprecation warnings, and URL formatting within a Vault-related Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'VAULT_TOKEN', file '~/.vault-token', and function arguments for parameter validation and formatting.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs formatted URLs, raises exceptions, and issues warnings based on deprecated parameters or methods.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or file input for tokens -> parameter validation functions -> deprecation warning generation -> URL formatting -> error raising based on Vault responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious network calls or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of helper functions for parameter validation, deprecation warnings, URL formatting, and error handling. It uses environment variables and file reads to obtain tokens, which are standard practices. The deprecation and warning functions are for informing users of outdated parameters or methods. URL encoding is done carefully to avoid injection issues. No code suggests malicious intent such as data theft, unauthorized network activity, or sabotage. The code is well-structured and relies on external exceptions and warnings. No obfuscated or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions aimed at safe parameter handling, deprecation warnings, and URL formatting. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and adheres to standard security practices for the described functions. No security risks or malicious indicators are present in this module.",
