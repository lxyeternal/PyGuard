  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for error handling, parameter validation, deprecation warnings, environment variable access, URL formatting, and data processing. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions perform standard, safe operations. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious patterns. Use of environment variables and file reads for tokens is typical in secure clients.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with focus on token retrieval from environment or file, URL formatting, and validation. Potential data leakage via token reading is noted but is standard practice.\n\n- **Assessment:** The token retrieval method is common in secure applications. No malicious behavior. URL encoding is standard. The slight securityRisk=0.1 reflects minimal concern over token access, which is acceptable.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No malicious issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for deprecation warnings, parameter aliasing, URL formatting, and error handling. No suspicious activity or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** Functions handle deprecation and URL encoding securely. Token handling via environment or file is standard. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with focus on error handling, parameter management, and URL formatting. No malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Standard practices. Token retrieval from environment and file is typical. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for error handling, validation, environment reading, URL formatting. No malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The only concern is reading tokens from `~/.vault-token`, which is a standard pattern. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are zero.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2) due to token reading from environment or files, which is standard but could be misused if the environment is compromised. However, this is a common pattern in secure clients and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — **correct**.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) are justified given the context, but overall the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to token handling via environment/file, which is standard but could be sensitive if environment is compromised)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code, with minor concern over token handling, which is typical and not malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The slight security risk score is justified but does not indicate malicious intent.",
