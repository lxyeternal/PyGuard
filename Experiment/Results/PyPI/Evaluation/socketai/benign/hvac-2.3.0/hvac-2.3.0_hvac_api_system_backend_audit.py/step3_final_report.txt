{
  "purpose": "Provides an API wrapper for managing system audit devices, including listing, enabling, disabling, and hashing audit devices.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as 'path', 'device_type', 'input_to_hash', and utility functions 'utils.format_url' and 'utils.remove_nones' for URL and payload construction.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests via self._adapter.get, post, delete methods with URLs and JSON payloads.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL formatting functions and request payloads, which are then sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected. Reliance on external utility functions for sanitization without their implementation details.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client for system audit management, with parameters used to construct URLs and request bodies. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern depends on the correctness and safety of 'utils.format_url' and 'utils.remove_nones'. If these utilities properly sanitize inputs, the risk of injection or misuse is minimal. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero risk depending on utility implementation. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main potential vulnerability lies in the external utility functions used for sanitization; assuming they are implemented securely, the overall security posture is low. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk around 0.2.",
