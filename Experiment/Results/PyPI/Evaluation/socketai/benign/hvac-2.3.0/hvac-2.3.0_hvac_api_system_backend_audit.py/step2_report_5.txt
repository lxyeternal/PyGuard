  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides methods to list, enable, disable, and hash audit devices. The analysis notes reliance on external utility functions (`remove_nones`, `format_url`) for sanitization, but their implementations are not shown.\n- **Potential issues:** The primary concern is that untrusted input (like `path`, `device_type`, `input_to_hash`) is incorporated into URL formatting and request payloads. If `utils.format_url` or `utils.remove_nones` do not sanitize inputs properly, this could lead to injection vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** 0, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3, acknowledging some risk if utilities are unsafe.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard API wrapper code with potential risks depending on utility functions' security. No obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The score of 0.8 confidence and malware 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, describes standard API wrapper methods with inputs used to build URLs and request bodies.\n- **Potential issues:** Same as above—risk depends on the sanitization in utility functions. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, slightly lower than Report 1, possibly reflecting confidence that the code is benign.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, just reliance on external utilities for sanitization.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is consistent. Malware score remains 0; security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar API wrapper functions, with focus on URL construction and request payloads.\n- **Potential issues:** Same concerns about URL and payload sanitization.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected; code appears standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—API wrapper functions for audit management.\n- **Potential issues:** Same reliance on external utilities for sanitization.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard API wrapper code.\n- **Potential issues:** URL formatting and parameter handling are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward API wrapper for audit management.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The main concern is input sanitization when constructing URLs and request payloads, which depends on external utility functions (`format_url`, `remove_nones`). Since their implementations are not provided, the risk hinges on their correctness.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given no malicious code is present.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2-0.3), reflecting the potential risk if utilities are unsafe, but not indicating an active vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (moderate, depending on utility function safety)\n\n**Note:** The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the utility functions used for URL formatting and parameter sanitization. If these are implemented securely, the code is safe. If not, injection vulnerabilities could exist, but there is no evidence of this in the current code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate API wrapper for audit device management. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The scores should reflect a malware score of 0, obfuscated 0, and a low to moderate security risk (around 0.2), contingent on the security of external utility functions.",
