  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main potential vulnerability lies in the external utility functions used for sanitization; assuming they are implemented securely, the overall security posture is low. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk around 0.2."
