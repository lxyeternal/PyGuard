{
  "purpose": "Provides methods for managing audit devices in a system backend, including listing, enabling, disabling, and hashing data for audit logs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'path', 'device_type', 'description', 'options', 'local', and 'input_to_hash' are sources where data is read from outside the system.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (get, post, delete) that send data to the backend server, potentially including untrusted input if not sanitized.",
  "flows": "User inputs like 'path', 'device_type', 'description', 'options', 'local', and 'input_to_hash' are used to construct URL paths or request bodies, which are sent via HTTP methods. Data flows from inputs to network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious URL patterns. The code correctly uses utility functions for URL formatting and omits sensitive data handling. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods that interact with system audit logs via REST API calls. Inputs are used to construct URLs and request payloads. The code relies on external utilities for URL formatting and data cleaning. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The functions perform legitimate administrative tasks without executing or evaluating untrusted code. The use of parameters like 'path' and 'input_to_hash' appears consistent with expected functionality, with no suspicious data flows. Overall, the code appears to be a standard API wrapper for audit management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client for audit device management with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages data inputs for system configuration tasks. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
