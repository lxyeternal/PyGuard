{
  "purpose": "This code provides methods to manage and interact with system audit devices, including listing, enabling, disabling, and hashing data for audit purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as 'path', 'device_type', 'description', 'options', 'local', and 'input_to_hash'.",
  "sinks": "The main sinks are network requests via 'self._adapter.get', 'self._adapter.post', and 'self._adapter.delete', which send data to specific API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input parameters into the 'params' dictionaries and URL formatting functions, then into network request methods that send data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. URL formatting appears standard. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward API wrapper methods for managing audit devices in a system. Inputs are taken via method parameters and used to construct URL paths and request bodies. The 'utils' functions used are for removing 'None' values and formatting URLs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The network requests are standard for managing audit configurations and do not appear to be malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate API wrapper methods for audit management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply facilitates communication with a system API for audit devices, with proper URL formatting and parameter handling.",
