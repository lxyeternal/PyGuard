  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the concerns are valid, consistent, and whether the scores reflect the actual risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages audit devices via REST API calls, with parameters flowing into URL formatting and request payloads. No malicious code or backdoors are detected. Potential concern is reliance on external utility functions (`remove_nones`, `format_url`) for sanitization, but their implementation isn't shown.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - The code itself appears legitimate and standard.\n  - No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n  - The potential security risk depends on the external utilities' correctness.\n  - The malware score is 0, which aligns with no malicious activity.\n  - The security risk is rated at 0.3, reflecting some concern about external sanitization.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  The overall assessment seems reasonable. The code is standard, and the low malware score is appropriate. The security risk score (0.3) accounts for the dependency on external sanitization.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code provides API wrapper methods for audit management. Inputs are used to build URLs and request bodies. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - Inputs flow into URL construction and request payloads.\n  - The code relies on external utility functions for sanitization.\n  - No signs of malicious behavior.\n  - Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - Security risk is 0.2, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity is present, and the low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard API wrapper methods. Inputs are used in URL and JSON payloads. No malicious code or obfuscation observed.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - Inputs flow into network requests.\n  - Dependence on utility functions for sanitization.\n  - No signs of malicious activity.\n  - Malware score remains 0.\n  - Security risk is 0.2, consistent with previous assessments.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  The analysis is consistent and reasonable. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard API wrapper functions with inputs used in URL and request payloads. No suspicious code or obfuscation. The potential concern is whether `utils.format_url` sanitizes inputs properly.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - Inputs are incorporated into URLs and JSON payloads.\n  - No malicious behavior or backdoors.\n  - Malware score is 0.\n  - Security risk is 0.2, based on potential URL injection if sanitization is inadequate.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  The risk assessment is appropriate. The code is benign, with the only concern being external utility functions' sanitization.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—API wrapper for audit management, with inputs flowing into network requests. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - Inputs used in URL and request data.\n  - No signs of malicious activity.\n  - Malware score 0.\n  - Security risk 0, as no issues are evident.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  The assessment is consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.2-0.3) reflect concerns about reliance on external sanitization utilities, but overall, the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — Slight concern due to external utility functions handling input sanitization, but no evidence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.15** — Very low, considering external sanitization dependencies but no direct evidence of issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard API wrapper for audit device management, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concern hinges on the implementation of utility functions (`remove_nones`, `format_url`), but in the absence of evidence, the overall risk remains minimal.",
