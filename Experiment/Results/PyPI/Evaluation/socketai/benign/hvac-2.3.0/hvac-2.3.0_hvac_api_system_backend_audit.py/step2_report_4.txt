  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward API wrapper for managing system audit devices, involving listing, enabling, disabling, and hashing.\n- Inputs are passed via parameters like 'path', 'device_type', 'input_to_hash', etc., and are used to construct URLs and request payloads.\n- Utility functions 'remove_nones' and 'format_url' are used for sanitization and URL formatting, but their implementations are not shown.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The main concern is potential injection or misuse if inputs are not sanitized properly.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as managing audit devices; notes reliance on external sanitization.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — reasonable, given the potential for URL injection if 'utils.format_url' is unsafe.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the risk hinges on the external utility functions' security.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard API interactions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — aligns with the low likelihood of issues if utilities are safe.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Comments:** Well-reasoned; no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with emphasis on URL and payload construction.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with prior assessments.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** No concerns about malicious activity; potential injection risk depends on utility functions.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar, confirms standard API wrapper behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** No issues identified; reliance on utility functions is noted.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Confirms the code's legitimacy and benign nature.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — minimal risk.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Very confident; no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- The primary concern is the potential for injection if 'utils.format_url' or 'remove_nones' do not sanitize inputs properly.\n- Since no implementation details of utility functions are provided, the risk remains theoretical but low.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for URL injection if utilities are unsafe, a conservative estimate would be **0.2 to 0.3**.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate API wrapper with minimal security concerns, primarily dependent on the implementation of external utility functions. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
