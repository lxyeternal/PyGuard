  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static test suite for Python syntax validation and parser robustness testing. It contains no malicious payloads, no obfuscated code, and poses no active security threat. The scores assigned in the critical reports are appropriate, with a very low risk score reflecting the potential for parser vulnerabilities if such malformed inputs are processed insecurely. Overall, the code is safe and intended solely for testing parser limits."
