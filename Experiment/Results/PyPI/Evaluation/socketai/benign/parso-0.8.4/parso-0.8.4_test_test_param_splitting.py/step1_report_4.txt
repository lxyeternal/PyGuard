{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing Python function parameter strings and testing the parsing behavior using the 'parso' library.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameter strings within the test functions, specifically in 'assert_params' calls and the string passed to 'parse'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code primarily performs parsing and assertions without executing or executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameter strings flow into 'parse', which generates AST nodes; these are then inspected and compared for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code uses standard parsing and testing routines.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'parso' for parsing Python code and uses 'dedent' for formatting source code snippets. It defines 'assert_params' to construct source code with parameter strings, parse it into an AST, extract parameter information, and verify correctness. Several test functions check parsing of parameter strings with various syntax features, including positional, keyword-only, '*', '**', and the use of '*' in parameter lists. The code solely performs parsing and testing without executing external input or interacting with the system or network. There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign testing utility for Python parser behavior with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely parses and inspects code snippets for correctness.",
