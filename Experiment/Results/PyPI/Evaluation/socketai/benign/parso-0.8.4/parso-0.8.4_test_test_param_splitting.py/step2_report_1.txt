  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the reports' conclusions, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions and tests for parsing Python function signatures using the 'parso' library.\n- The functions generate code snippets dynamically, parse them into ASTs, and verify parameter extraction.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, network activity, or user input processing is present.\n- The code is static, focused on syntax parsing and validation.\n- No obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The 'malware' scores assigned are all zero, and the security risk scores are very low or zero.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, intended for testing and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws are identified in the code logic.\n- **Scores:** The 'malware' scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis. The 'securityRisk' scores are also very low, consistent with benign static analysis code.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** All reports dismiss any potential vulnerabilities, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Potential assumptions:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The code's purpose is to parse and test Python function signatures, not to execute or process untrusted data.\n- The use of 'parso' is standard for static code analysis.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or near-zero) are justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.05           |\n\n*Rationale:* The code is purely static analysis for testing purposes, with no malicious features. The slight security risk score accounts for the fact that it processes code snippets, but these are hardcoded and not from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe, with no malware or security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
