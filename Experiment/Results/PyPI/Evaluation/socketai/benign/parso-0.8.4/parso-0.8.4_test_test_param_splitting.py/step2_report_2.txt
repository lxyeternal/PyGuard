  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, errors, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a utility for parsing Python function signatures using 'parso'.\n- The code appears to be a set of test functions validating parameter parsing.\n- No report indicates any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity.\n- The code does not manipulate sensitive data or perform any side effects.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues & Logic\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code's purpose is to test parsing of function parameters, which aligns with the implementation.\n- **Malware presence:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities or assumptions leading to security issues are identified.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (1) or near high, reflecting the consensus.\n\n### Potential Issues or Overestimations\n\n- The only minor point is report #4 assigns a security risk of 0.1, citing no explicit reason but possibly due to the use of 'parso'. Given the code's benign nature, even this seems slightly overcautious but acceptable.\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code is a straightforward static analysis utility with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the consensus of the reports.",
