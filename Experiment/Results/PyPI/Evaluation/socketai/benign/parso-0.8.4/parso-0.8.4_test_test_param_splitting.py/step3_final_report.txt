{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and tests for parsing Python function signatures using the 'parso' library, primarily for static analysis and validation of parameter extraction.",
  "sources": "Code snippets defining functions with various parameter configurations, and the 'parso.parse' function used to generate ASTs from these snippets.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; the code processes static string literals and the 'parso' parsing functions, with no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "From static code strings defining functions to AST parsing via 'parso', then extracting parameters and verifying correctness through assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries for static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static test functions that generate code snippets, parse them into ASTs, and verify parameter extraction. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data. The use of 'parso' is standard for static syntax analysis. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate testing of function signature parsing, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for testing Python function signature parsing. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
