  "purpose": "Static test suite for 'parso' Python parsing library, verifying syntax and structure correctness.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded Python code snippets within test functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or system calls involved.",
  "flows": "In-memory parsing and assertion checks from code snippets to validation outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static test cases for parsing validation, operating on internal, hardcoded data. It does not execute untrusted code, handle external inputs, or perform network/system operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are observed. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose is clearly to verify parser correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat and is safe for use.",
