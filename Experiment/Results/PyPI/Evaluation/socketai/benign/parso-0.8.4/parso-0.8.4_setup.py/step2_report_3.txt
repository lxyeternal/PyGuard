  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project (`parso`).\n- It reads static files (`README.rst`, `CHANGELOG.rst`) for long description.\n- It imports `parso` to get the version, which is typical.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- The use of `from __future__ import with_statement` is outdated but harmless in Python 3.6+.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The `__future__` import for `with_statement` is unnecessary in Python 3 and deprecated. It doesn't introduce security risks but indicates legacy code support.\n\n### Potential flaws or anomalies:\n\n- Reading files directly without context managers (e.g., `with open() as f:`) is not best practice but not malicious.\n- No validation of external files exists, but that’s typical for setup scripts.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Malware and security risk assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security risk:** 0, as no untrusted input or external network activity occurs.\n\n### Score adjustments:\n\n- The scores given (mostly 0 or 0.9-1 confidence) are reasonable.\n- The high confidence (1) in reports 1 and 3 aligns with the straightforward, benign nature.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) in report 2 due to mention of deprecated import but still accurate.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):\n\n- None of the reports indicate any malicious activity or vulnerability.\n- The only \"anomaly\" is the outdated import, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and standard.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a typical, benign `setup.py` script with minor outdated syntax (the `__future__` import). All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis setup script is safe, standard, and contains no security issues.",
