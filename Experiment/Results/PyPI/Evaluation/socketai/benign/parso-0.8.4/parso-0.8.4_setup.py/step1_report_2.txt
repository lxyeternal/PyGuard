  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'parso' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGELOG.rst' files for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Read files -> assign to variables -> pass to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__future__' import for 'with_statement' is outdated and unnecessary in Python 3+; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, defining metadata, reading files for long description, and calling setuptools.setup() with appropriate arguments. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The import of 'parso' relies on its presence and version, but this is typical for setup scripts. The use of 'with_statement' import is deprecated in Python 3 but does not affect functionality; it is not malicious. Overall, the script is a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only notable issue is the outdated '__future__' import, which does not impact security. No malicious activity or sabotage detected.",
