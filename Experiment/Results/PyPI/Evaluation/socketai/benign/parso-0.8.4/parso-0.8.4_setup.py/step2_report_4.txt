  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify this as a standard setup.py script for packaging the 'parso' library.\n- No report mentions dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling untrusted input.\n- The only noted anomaly is the use of the deprecated `__future__` import for `with_statement`, which is harmless in Python 3+.\n- The code reads static files (`README.rst`, `CHANGELOG.rst`) directly without validation or exception handling—common in setup scripts.\n- The import of `parso` to retrieve `__version__` is typical, assuming the package is present in the environment during setup.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input, write untrusted data, or perform any network operations.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The reports correctly conclude that the script is benign and standard for packaging.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0 or 0.1, which aligns with the absence of security risks.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:**\n- The only minor concern is the outdated `__future__` import, but it does not impact security.\n- Reading files without exception handling is not ideal but not malicious.\n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe setup.py for 'parso' is a standard, harmless packaging script. No malicious or security issues are present.",
