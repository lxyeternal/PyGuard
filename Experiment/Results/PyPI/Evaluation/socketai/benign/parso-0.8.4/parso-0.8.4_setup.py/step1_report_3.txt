  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'parso' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and CHANGELOG.rst files, importing parso module for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file writes, or environment variable manipulations.",
  "flows": "Read files to construct long_description, pass data into setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated __future__ import 'with_statement' in Python 2 syntax; reading files directly without context managers; no validation of external files. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It imports necessary modules, reads documentation files, and calls setup() with package metadata. The use of the deprecated __future__ import suggests legacy Python 2 support but is harmless. File reading occurs outside of context managers, which is not best practice but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, no external network activity, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior are present. The package appears to be straightforward and intended for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script performs typical package configuration tasks with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution, and no malicious intent is apparent.",
