{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'parso' Python library, defining metadata and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads static files ('README.rst', 'CHANGELOG.rst') and imports 'parso' to get version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and imports version; no dynamic data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated 'from __future__ import with_statement' in Python 3; reads files without context managers.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with static file reads and package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The deprecated import is harmless in Python 3, and file reading without context managers is a style issue, not security-related. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.",
