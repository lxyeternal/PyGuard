{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the 'parso' Python package, used to specify package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'CHANGELOG.rst' files to assemble long description; imports package version from 'parso' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or write untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads package files for description, imports version info, and calls setup() to configure package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'with_statement' import from __future__, which is deprecated in Python 3 and unnecessary; no other anomalies or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module, utilizing setuptools. It reads static files for descriptions and imports the package version directly from the module. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The inclusion of 'with_statement' import is outdated but harmless in Python 3.6+; no malicious patterns or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
