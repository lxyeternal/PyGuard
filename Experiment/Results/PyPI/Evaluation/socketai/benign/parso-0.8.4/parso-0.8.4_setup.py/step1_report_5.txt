{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the 'parso' Python package for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGELOG.rst' for long description; imports package 'parso' to get version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is used to affect system or leak data.",
  "flows": "File contents (README and CHANGELOG) read and passed into setup; 'parso.__version__' accessed for version; no data flows into or from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'with_statement' import from __future__ is deprecated in Python 3 and does not affect malicious behavior; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: reading documentation files, importing 'parso' for version info, and calling 'setup()' with package metadata. No input validation or untrusted data handling is present. The code does not execute or evaluate user input, nor does it connect to external services or perform actions that could be malicious. The only potential concern is the use of deprecated __future__ import, which is harmless and unrelated to security. Overall, the script appears to be a normal setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely handles package metadata and data inclusion for distribution.",
