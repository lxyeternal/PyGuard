{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a test utility for verifying issues detected by a Python code normalizer, involving parsing and error collection.",
  "sources": "Reading code data from files via open() and read() functions, including potential Unicode conversion.",
  "sinks": "No critical sinks; usage of regex matching and sorting functions that process input data without unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files, processed through regex and normalizer functions, then compared and sorted for testing purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed. No dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, performs file I/O, regex matching, and sorting, all in a testing context. No suspicious data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are for error collection and test validation. No backdoors, network operations, or credential handling are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with normal test utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing script for code normalization issues with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It reads data, processes it, and asserts correctness without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
