{
  "purpose": "A testing utility that reads Python source files, extracts expected error codes from comments, parses the code with parso, and compares the actual issues detected with the expected ones.",
  "sources": "File input in binary mode, reading code as bytes, regex matching for comments, parsing code with parso.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data flows; internal processing only.",
  "flows": "File read -> bytes to unicode -> regex extraction -> parsing with parso -> comparison of issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies; straightforward use of standard modules; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign testing utility designed for verifying error codes in Python source files. It reads files, extracts expected issues from comments, parses the code with parso, and compares detected issues with expectations. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data beyond file reading occurs. The code uses standard modules and patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All operations are safe and within scope for a testing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward testing utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
