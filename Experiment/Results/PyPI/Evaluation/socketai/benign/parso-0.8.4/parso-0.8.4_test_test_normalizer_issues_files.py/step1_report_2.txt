{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a testing utility for verifying issues raised by a code normalizer, specifically for handling error codes in source code comments.",
  "sources": "Reading input code from files via open(), reading bytes and converting to unicode with python_bytes_to_unicode.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code processes and compares issues internally without executing or handling untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input code is read from a file, processed to collect error annotations, and then compared with issues identified by a parser. No external or untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard modules; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution observed. The code is straightforward and conventional for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script reads source code from files, parses it using parso, and collects annotated expected issues from comments. It then compares these with issues generated by the parser. The process involves no network activity, no code injection, or data leakage. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are present. It is a benign testing utility for internal validation of a normalizer component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing script for normalizer issue verification. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No suspicious activity or security concerns are identified.",
