{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a testing or validation utility for verifying error codes in a code normalization or linting process, specifically for use with pydocstyle and parso.",
  "sources": "Reads code from a file in 'normalizer_issue_case.path' and processes it in 'collect_errors' function.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that executes untrusted data. The code primarily reads files and processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> parses text -> extracts error codes -> compares against parser output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Uses regular expressions, but nothing suggests obfuscation or malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for testing normalizer issues by reading a file, extracting expected error codes with regex, parsing the same code with parso, and comparing the results. It performs file I/O, data parsing, and comparison, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions are standard and well-scoped. No suspicious patterns, no hidden or obfuscated code, no external network activity, or unsafe handling of sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal utility for testing code normalization issues. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
