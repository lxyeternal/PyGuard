{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a test suite utilizing 'pytest' and 'parso' to validate Python code parsing, formatting, and syntax correctness through static code snippets.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from hardcoded string variables within test functions, such as 'code_basic_features' and other code snippets used in parsing and comparison.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects, as all data is static and internal.",
  "flows": "The flow involves parsing static code snippets with 'parso', then comparing or validating the generated code, with no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, static, and solely for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite that uses 'parso' to parse predefined Python code snippets and validate parsing correctness. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code's purpose is purely validation, and it operates in a controlled environment. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no security risks or malware present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test suite for the 'parso' Python parsing library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should be 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
