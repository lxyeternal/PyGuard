{
  "purpose": "Unit testing functions from the 'parso' library, specifically loading grammars and parsing version strings.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from test parameters ('string', 'version'), which are hardcoded test values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no sensitive data handling, and no system or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The test functions call internal functions with controlled input to verify behavior, no external flow or data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code behavior are observed. The code strictly performs unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard pytest framework for unit testing, invoking functions with predefined inputs and checking for expected exceptions or outputs. It includes parameterized tests covering invalid inputs, version parsing, and exception handling. There are no indications of malicious activity, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears solely to verify library functionality without side effects or external data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite for 'parso' library functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
