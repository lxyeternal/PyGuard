{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for verifying the behavior of the 'parso' library's 'load_grammar' function and 'utils._parse_version' method.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest', 'parso.grammar', and 'parso.utils'; usage of test functions with predefined input data.",
  "sinks": "Assertions within test functions; exceptions raised on invalid input, primarily for testing error handling.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to 'load_grammar' and 'utils._parse_version' functions; exceptions triggered if invalid data is provided.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code strictly implements standard testing procedures without hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing frameworks and library functions, then defines multiple test cases to verify expected behaviors and error handling. It tests for proper exception raising with invalid versions and inputs. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious network activity, or hidden code. The code's structure and functions are typical for unit testing; no suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign set of unit tests for the 'parso' library functions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a safe testing script that does not contain malware or malicious logic.",
