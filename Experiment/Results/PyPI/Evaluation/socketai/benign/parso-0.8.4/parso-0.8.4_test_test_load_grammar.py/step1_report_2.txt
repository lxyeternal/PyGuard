  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'parso' library's grammar loading and version parsing functionalities.",
  "sources": "pytest framework functions, parso.grammar.load_grammar, parso.utils._parse_version",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted or external data for security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Input strings to version parsing functions, which are used for internal validation; no data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. All code appears to be standard test code for library validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing using pytest for version loading and parsing functions. It tests valid and invalid inputs, expecting specific exceptions. No external network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration is present. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns detected. The tests are straightforward and align with normal testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for the parso library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations, leak data, or include backdoors.",
