  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a set of unit tests for the 'parso' library, specifically testing `load_grammar` and `utils._parse_version`.\n   - Tests include valid cases, invalid version strings, and unsupported versions, expecting exceptions.\n   - The code uses standard testing practices with `pytest`.\n   - No network activity, file manipulation, or external data processing is evident.\n   - All inputs are hardcoded test data; no untrusted data sources are involved.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely for testing purposes.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads.\n   - No suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - The code does not perform any system modifications or network operations.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Given the benign nature, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscation is not present, so **0**.\n   - **Risk Score:** Since the code is only testing and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious activity, the overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature, with confidence level 1.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behavior are identified.\n   - The code is standard testing code, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a standard, safe unit testing script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores should reflect this benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Suggested Value | Justification                                                  |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected.                                  |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, straightforward test code.                                |\n| Risk           | 0                 | No security risks or vulnerabilities introduced.               |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, and the scores should be set accordingly.**",
