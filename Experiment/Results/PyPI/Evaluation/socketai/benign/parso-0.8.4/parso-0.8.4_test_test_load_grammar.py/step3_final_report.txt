  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'parso' library's 'load_grammar' function and version parsing utility.",
  "sources": "Input version strings, including valid, invalid, and unsupported versions.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling that raises errors for invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed and validated; exceptions are raised for invalid cases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward test cases.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing with parameterized inputs to verify correct behavior and exception handling. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The functions tested are internal validation routines. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code is clear, with no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for version validation in the 'parso' library. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero.",
