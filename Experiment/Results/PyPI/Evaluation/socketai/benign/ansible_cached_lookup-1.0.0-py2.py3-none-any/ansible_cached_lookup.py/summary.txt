  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured caching plugin with no inherent malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the dynamic plugin loading based on user input, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the risk score is moderate (~0.45) to reflect this potential attack surface. Implementing input validation or restricting lookup plugin names can further reduce this risk."
