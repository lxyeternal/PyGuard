{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for encoding integers into base36 strings and decoding them back, likely for compact representation or serialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameter 'number' in dumps() and 'value' in loads(), with no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "The loads() function converts a string into an integer using Python's built-in int() function with base 36, which is a safe operation without security implications.",
  "flows": "The 'number' input flows through type validation in dumps() before being converted into a string; in loads(), the 'value' flows directly into int() conversion. No external untrusted data is manipulated or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The functions are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for base36 encoding/decoding of integers. It checks the type of input to prevent errors and performs conversion using standard Python operations. No external data, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. The functions appear to be simple serialization helpers without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of integer-base36 encoding and decoding, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and does not pose security threats.",
