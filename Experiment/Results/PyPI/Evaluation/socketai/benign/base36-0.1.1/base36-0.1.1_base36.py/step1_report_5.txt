{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode integers into base36 string representations.",
  "sources": "The functions 'dumps' and 'loads' read input parameters: 'number' and 'value' respectively.",
  "sinks": "The 'loads' function converts a string to an integer using Python's int() with base 36; no external data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "The 'dumps' function reads an integer and outputs a base36 string; 'loads' takes a string and returns an integer, with no external or untrusted data flow beyond input parsing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for base36 encoding/decoding with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version and export list, handles Python version differences for integer types, and provides two functions for base36 conversion. 'dumps' encodes integers, supporting negative values, into strings using a defined alphabet; 'loads' decodes strings back into integers. The implementation is straightforward, standard, and does not include any network access, file operations, or hidden behavior. No suspicious code or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs simple integer encoding/decoding without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It appears safe and benign.",
