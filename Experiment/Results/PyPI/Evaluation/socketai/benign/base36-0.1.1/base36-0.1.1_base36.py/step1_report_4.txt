  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for encoding integers into base36 strings and decoding base36 strings back into integers.",
  "sources": "The 'dumps' function reads the input parameter 'number'; the 'loads' function reads the input parameter 'value'.",
  "sinks": "The 'loads' function converts a string into an integer, which could potentially be exploited if the input is maliciously crafted, but in this context, it's a safe use of the int() function with base 36. No other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows through validation in 'dumps' before conversion to a string; input 'value' flows into 'loads' where it is parsed to an integer with base 36. No external network or file I/O is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version compatibility, a character alphabet for base36 encoding, and two functions for encoding and decoding integers. The 'dumps' function handles integer validation and converts the number into a base36 string, supporting negative numbers. The 'loads' function parses a base36 string back into an integer. There are no suspicious code patterns, no external data handling, no cryptic code, and no apparent malicious behavior. The functions operate solely on provided inputs and do not perform any network, file, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign utility for base36 encoding/decoding of integers. It does not contain malicious code or behavior and poses no security risks based on its content.",
