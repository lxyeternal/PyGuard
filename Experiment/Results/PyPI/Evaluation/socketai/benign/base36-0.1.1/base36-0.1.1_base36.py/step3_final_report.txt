  "purpose": "A utility module providing functions to encode integers into base36 strings and decode base36 strings back into integers.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' in 'dumps'; input parameter 'value' in 'loads'.",
  "sinks": "The 'loads' function uses Python's int() with base 36, which is safe; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows through validation and while loop in 'dumps' to produce a string; input 'value' flows into int() in 'loads' to produce an integer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; minimal validation only in 'dumps'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for base36 encoding and decoding of integers. It includes compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3. The 'dumps' function validates that input is an integer and handles negative numbers. The 'loads' function relies on Python's built-in int() with base 36, which is safe for controlled inputs. No external data sources, network activity, or file I/O is involved. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The minimal input validation in 'dumps' is appropriate; 'loads' assumes well-formed base36 strings. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for base36 encoding and decoding of integers. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The risk score can be considered 0, and obfuscation score is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
