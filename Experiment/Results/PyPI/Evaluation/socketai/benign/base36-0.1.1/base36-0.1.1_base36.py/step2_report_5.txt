  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the details provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility for base36 encoding/decoding of integers.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are involved.\n- Input validation is minimal but sufficient for the scope.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The functions operate solely on provided parameters.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; describes utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, which is reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; functions are benign, straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, high certainty.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; functions are simple, safe, and standard.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Also correct; the only point is the securityRisk score of 0.1.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Given the code's simplicity, a risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high; it's more accurate to set it at 0 unless there is a specific context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly overestimated; I would recommend lowering it to 0, as the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; the code is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Again, the security risk score could be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly overestimated in some reports; the code is a simple utility with no security implications.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no security risk inherent in the code)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- The code is safe, standard, and well-structured.\n- The only minor point is the security risk score, which should be zero given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious activity present                                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0                   | No security vulnerabilities or risks inherent in the code  |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed explanation for any specific aspect.",
