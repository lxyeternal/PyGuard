{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to encode integers into base36 strings and decode them back to integers.",
  "sources": "Reads input via function parameters ('number' in dumps and 'value' in loads). No external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses built-in functions (type check, int conversion) but no external data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows into dumps, converting to a string; input 'value' flows into loads, converting string back to integer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The functions are straightforward encoding/decoding routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility for base36 encoding and decoding of integers. It includes a version check for Python 2/3 compatibility, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, no network operations, no data leaks, no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The functions only operate on provided input parameters and use safe, standard library functions. No potential security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for integer encoding/decoding with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
