  "purpose": "Utility functions to encode and decode integers to and from base36 strings.",
  "sources": "User inputs via function parameters 'number' (in dumps) and 'value' (in loads).",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions 'int()' and 'divmod()', which process input data.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows through validation and processing in 'dumps'; input 'value' flows into 'int()' in 'loads'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Functions perform standard encoding/decoding operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version and a list, sets integer types based on Python version, and implements base36 encoding and decoding. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are present. The logic is straightforward, with input validation in 'dumps'. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are detected. The functions serve simple, standard conversion purposes. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides basic integer encoding/decoding functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard utility module with safe, predictable behavior.",
