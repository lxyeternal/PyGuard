  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard setup script for packaging 'base36'.  \n- Sources: Reads 'README.rst' for long_description.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Data from file into setup parameters.  \n- Anomalies: No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- Analysis: Straightforward, no malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, typical setup script.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources: Reads 'README.rst'.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Standard data flow.  \n- Anomalies: No anomalies; straightforward code.  \n- Analysis: No malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources: Reads 'README.rst', but notes the use of `next(readme)` to skip the first line.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Data from file into long_description.  \n- Anomalies: Skipping the first line is unusual but not malicious.  \n- Analysis: No malicious activity; standard setup.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. The skipping of the first line is a minor anomaly but not security-relevant.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources: Reads 'README.rst' and static metadata.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Static data into setup().  \n- Anomalies: No anomalies.  \n- Analysis: Standard setup script.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources: Reads README and static metadata.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: Data from file into long_description.  \n- Anomalies: No anomalies.  \n- Analysis: Standard setup script.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for packaging, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign malware=0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign obfuscated=0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign securityRisk=0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code reads a static README file and sets up package metadata without any dynamic or external inputs.\n- No network calls, code injection, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The only anomaly is the use of `next(readme)` to skip the first line, which is not malicious but somewhat unusual. However, it does not introduce security concerns.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical Python package setup script with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nAll assessments are correct based on the provided code and reports.",
