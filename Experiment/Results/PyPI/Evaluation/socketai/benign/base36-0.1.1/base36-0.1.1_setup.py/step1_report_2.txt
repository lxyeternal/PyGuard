{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python module called 'base36'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'README.rst' to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.rst' flows into 'long_description', but this is standard file reading without untrusted data handling issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', reads 'README.rst' to set the long description, and calls 'setup' with package metadata. The reading process is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious code involved. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package setup operations safely.",
