      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for base36 encoding and decoding of integers. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The risk score can be considered 0, and obfuscation score is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate; no modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. The minor anomaly of skipping the first line of the README does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood."
