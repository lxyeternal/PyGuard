  "purpose": "This code sets up an AWS CDK module for S3 deployment, importing necessary libraries, loading a JSII assembly, and publishing the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements, __jsii_assembly__ load, publication.publish()",
  "sinks": "publication.publish() potentially triggers deployment actions",
  "flows": "Imports and assembly load lead to publication.publish() execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for an AWS CDK module, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. The call to publication.publish() is typical in such scripts and does not indicate malicious intent. No data flows from untrusted sources or to suspicious sinks are present. The code is clear, straightforward, and follows common patterns, with no anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The publication.publish() call is standard and not malicious. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score is zero.",
