  "purpose": "Configuration utility for managing LocalStack service endpoints, ports, and host parsing based on environment variables and default settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AWS_ENDPOINT_URL, LOCALSTACK_HOST, USE_SSL, USE_LEGACY_PORTS), host:port strings in parse_localstack_host()",
  "sinks": "URL construction for service endpoints, port extraction from URLs",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> parse_localstack_host() -> get_service_endpoints() -> URL construction",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; import of patch_expand_host_prefix is unused here but could affect upstream behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration utility that manages service endpoints and ports for LocalStack, relying on environment variables and standard parsing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import of patch_expand_host_prefix is noted but not used here, posing no immediate risk. The environment variables are typical for such tools and do not leak secrets. The code performs URL and port handling securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified. It functions as a standard configuration utility for LocalStack endpoints.",
