{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import of 'setuptools' module, and the call to setup() function",
  "sinks": "The setup() function execution, which could potentially process configuration data",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' -> execution of setup() function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic code execution, and the setup() call is standard in Python packaging",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of importing the 'setuptools' module and executing the setup() function. This is a common pattern in Python package setup scripts. No external data sources, untrusted input, or suspicious logic are present. The setup() function uses default parameters, indicating a basic package configuration without hidden or malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs a typical package setup operation without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
