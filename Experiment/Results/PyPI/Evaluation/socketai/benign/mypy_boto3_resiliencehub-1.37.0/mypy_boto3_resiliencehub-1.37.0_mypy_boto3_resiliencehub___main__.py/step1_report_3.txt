  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that provides package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv (user input argument), sys.stdout (output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (writes data to stdout)",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments in sys.argv -> print_version() if '--version' is present -> output via sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code performs straightforward output operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to print static package information and version details, then invokes these functions based on command-line arguments. It does not read external data besides command-line input and outputs static, predefined strings. No network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code is present. The code logic is simple and standard for CLI interfaces. No anomalies or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script intended to display package info and version. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks.",
