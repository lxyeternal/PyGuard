  "purpose": "CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() is called; both output static info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that checks for '--version' argument and outputs predefined static information. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input beyond argument detection. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are present. The code's structure is clear, and the functions only write static strings. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and performs only informational output. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The analysis confirms a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence.",
