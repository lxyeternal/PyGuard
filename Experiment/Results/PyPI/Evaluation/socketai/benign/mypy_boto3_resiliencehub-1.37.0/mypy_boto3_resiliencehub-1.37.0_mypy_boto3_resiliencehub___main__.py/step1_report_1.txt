{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes output to stdout.",
  "targets": "Outputs informational strings to stdout based on user input.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and exits; otherwise, calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for command-line argument processing and output. It defines two functions to display package info and version. The main() function checks for '--version' argument and responds accordingly, defaulting to displaying info. There are no data leaks, environment variable misuse, or suspicious behaviors. No network activity or data collection present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying static package info and version. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
