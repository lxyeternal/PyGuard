  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), and writes output to stdout.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; no untrusted data source identified.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) -> print_version() or print_info() -> stdout.write.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Code is straightforward and typical for CLI info display.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and a main function that responds to '--version' argument. The output is static, hardcoded text with links and version info. No external data sources, no user input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code structures. Overall, the script functions solely as an informational CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use.",
