  "purpose": "Provide CLI interface to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 ResilienceHub.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via sys.argv, writing to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "stdout output; no other data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line argument) influences whether print_version() is called; output is directed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code simply outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. The main() function checks for '--version' argument to determine output. There are no external data inputs beyond command-line args, and no network, file, or sensitive data access. The code’s logic is straightforward, with static print statements. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The only potential concern is if the static output contains sensitive info, but it appears to be benign documentation and version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script that outputs package information. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate utility script with no security risks.",
