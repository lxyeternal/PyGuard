  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, writes output to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) influences whether print_version() is called, which outputs version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version to stdout, and a main function that checks for '--version' argument. The flow is simple: if '--version' is present, prints version; otherwise, prints info. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious logic. The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for displaying package info and version, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
