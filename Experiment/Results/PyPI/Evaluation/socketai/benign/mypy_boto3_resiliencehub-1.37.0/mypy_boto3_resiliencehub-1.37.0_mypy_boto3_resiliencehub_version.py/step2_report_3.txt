  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward: they assign a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n- There are no external inputs, no data flows, no sinks, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- The code is a standard pattern for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static version string with no external data or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No, all reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The scores for obfuscated code, malware, and security risk are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is clearly benign, no higher scores are justified.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly set to 0 in all reports; no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a simple version declaration.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes are necessary. The overall security posture of this snippet is very low risk, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
