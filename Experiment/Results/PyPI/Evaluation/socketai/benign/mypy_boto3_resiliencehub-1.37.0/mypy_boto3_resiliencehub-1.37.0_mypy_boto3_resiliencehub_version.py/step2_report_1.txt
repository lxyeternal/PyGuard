  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code snippets in all reports are straightforward: a comment, a copyright statement, and a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, external data sources, or complex logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Claim:** Benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is standard for version declaration.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Claim:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. Static assignment, no external data or suspicious code.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Claim:** Standard practice, no security issues.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Claim:** No signs of malicious activity; straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is a simple version string assignment.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Claim:** Benign, no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the Scores\n- All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- `securityRisk` is 0 in all reports, which is justified.\n- `confidence` is 1 in all, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Are there any hidden or obfuscated elements?** No.\n- **Could the version string be manipulated externally?** No, it's a static string.\n- **Is there any potential for malicious behavior?** No, the code only defines a variable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. Correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports. Correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports. Correct.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and the static nature of the code, I concur with the existing scores. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.",
