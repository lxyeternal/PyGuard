  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains only comments and a variable assignment.\n- No input sources, external data, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code is benign and functions solely as a version identifier.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code.\n\n**Score Analysis:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- Security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Potential Risks and Malicious Indicators:**\n- No malicious activity, such as dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or obfuscation, is present.\n- The code is a typical version declaration, common in many projects.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- If someone claimed that setting a version string could be malicious, that would be unfounded; version declarations are standard.\n- No assumptions about external dependencies or behaviors are necessary here.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the code's simplicity and purpose, there's no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate; no further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
