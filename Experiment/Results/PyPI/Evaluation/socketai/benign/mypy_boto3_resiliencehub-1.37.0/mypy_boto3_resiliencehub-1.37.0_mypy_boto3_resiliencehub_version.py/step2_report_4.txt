  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or sinks are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is minimal, standard practice for version declaration in Python packages.\n- All confidence scores are 1, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The reports are very consistent and thorough, and they all agree on the benign nature.\n- The code snippet is a common pattern with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The only possible concern might be if the version string were dynamically generated or fetched from an untrusted source, but in this case, it is a static string.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple, static version declaration.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThis code is standard, benign, and poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No evidence suggests any malicious or obfuscated activity.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward version declaration with no security concerns. The scores reflect its benign nature accurately.",
