  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Analysis Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward assignment of a static string to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment. There are no inputs, outputs, external data flows, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. This is a standard pattern for defining package versioning in Python modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static version string with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in reports?**  \n  No. Each report accurately describes the code as benign, with consistent reasoning and no signs of security issues.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that static assignment of version strings is inherently safe, which is correct.\n- No claims are made about external dependencies or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct; no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns.**",
