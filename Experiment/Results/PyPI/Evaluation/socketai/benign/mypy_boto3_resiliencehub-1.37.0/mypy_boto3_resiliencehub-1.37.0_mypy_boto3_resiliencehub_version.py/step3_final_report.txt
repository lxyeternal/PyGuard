  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright statement, and a static string assignment to __version__. There are no inputs, outputs, external data sources, or dynamic behaviors. The code is a standard pattern for version declaration in Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
