  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-resiliencehub, defining package metadata and reading a local README file.",
  "sources": "Reads the local README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static metadata passed to setuptools.setup().",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code, no dynamic or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports only trusted libraries, reads a local file, and calls setup() with static metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and confidence is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All signals indicate no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
