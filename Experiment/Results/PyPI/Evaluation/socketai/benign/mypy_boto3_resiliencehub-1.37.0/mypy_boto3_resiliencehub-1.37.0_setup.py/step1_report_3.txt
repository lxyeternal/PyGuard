{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-resiliencehub' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; imports 'Path' from 'pathlib'; imports 'setup' from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data flows or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to assign to 'LONG_DESCRIPTION'; uses static package metadata; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It reads static files, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for setuptools. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code; it appears to be a standard, well-formed setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares a Python package for distribution, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior.",
