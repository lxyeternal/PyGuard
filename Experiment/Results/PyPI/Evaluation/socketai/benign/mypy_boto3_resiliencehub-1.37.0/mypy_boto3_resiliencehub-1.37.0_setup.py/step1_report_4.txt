{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-resiliencehub', used to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads environment variables indirectly through setup tools; no explicit input sources or untrusted data input in the code.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is written or transmitted, no command execution, no network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script mainly defines package metadata and configuration for packaging tools.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. All code appears standard and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools. It imports modules, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no inputs from external sources at runtime that could introduce malicious data. No network, command execution, or data manipulation occurs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration file with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It simply facilitates package installation with standard metadata.",
