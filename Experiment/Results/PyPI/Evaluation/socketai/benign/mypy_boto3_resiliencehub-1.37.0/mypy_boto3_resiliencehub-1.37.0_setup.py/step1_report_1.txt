  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and installation of the 'mypy-boto3-resiliencehub' Python package, providing metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.md' using Path(__file__).parent / 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system commands executed; no data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description -> supplies metadata to setuptools -> installs dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script structure, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It imports only standard libraries and setuptools, reads a local README file, and passes metadata to the setup() function. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data or external systems. The script does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as executing system commands, connecting to networks, or handling sensitive data. All operations are read-only and involve local file access for package description.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, conventional setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
