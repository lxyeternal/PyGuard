  "purpose": "This setup script is used for configuring and installing the 'mypy-boto3-resiliencehub' package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package data; uses hardcoded package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no user input or external data processing involved.",
  "flows": "The script loads static data (package info, descriptions, URLs, dependencies) without any data flow from external or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script structure. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and setuptools for package setup. It reads a README file for long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no suspicious data flows are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup.py patterns. All data is static or read from trusted locations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
