  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and install a Python package called 'mypy-boto3-resiliencehub' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ variable to locate README.md; importing 'setuptools.setup'; reading the README.md file content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data effects are evident; no network or file operations with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading the long description from the README.md file, then passing static configuration data to 'setup()'. No dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code strictly performs package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Path' to read the README.md for the long description, then calls 'setup()' with static metadata, version, package info, URLs, classifiers, keywords, dependencies, and other metadata. There is no use of user input, environment variables, network calls, or code execution. The code appears standard and typical for a setup script, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It contains no external data sinks, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. It is safe and standard.",
