{
  "purpose": "Provides main interface and documentation for the resiliencehub service, exporting clients and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), no external input sources or data inputs present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no output or network communication is present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines imports, constants, and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The copyright date appears intentionally set in 2025, possibly a typo, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes from local files and assigns an alias. It defines a Client variable pointing to ResilienceHubClient and specifies __all__ for exports. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external network operations are present. The code mainly serves as a facade or interface for other modules. The documentation section is purely descriptive. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily acts as a wrapper and documentation for other components. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
