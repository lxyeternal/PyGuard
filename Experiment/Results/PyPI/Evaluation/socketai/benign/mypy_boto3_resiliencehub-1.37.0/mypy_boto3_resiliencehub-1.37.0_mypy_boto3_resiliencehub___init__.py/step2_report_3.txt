  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a simple module that imports classes and functions, assigns an alias, and defines `__all__`.\n- The documentation is standard, providing usage examples and links.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network operations, or obfuscated code.\n- The copyright date is set to 2025, which is in the future; this could be a placeholder or typo but isn't inherently malicious.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning malware scores of 0 and security risks of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports conclude the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious logic, and no vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  **No.** The code is standard, and the reports correctly identify it as a benign interface module.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n  These seem appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The reports assign 0 for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future date (2025), but that doesn't imply malicious intent.\n\n### Malware score:\n- **Should be 0?**  \n  **Yes.** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated payloads.\n\n### Obfuscated:\n- **Should be 0?**  \n  **Yes.** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n### Overall risk estimate:\n- Based on the code and reports, **malware: 0**, **obfuscated: 0**, **risk: 0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, serving as a simple interface module.\n- No suspicious patterns, no data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe and benign. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
