{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface and documentation for the resiliencehub service, including client initialization and available paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), code comments, and documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; primarily imports and documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or sinks; mostly static imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; straightforward module with no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple interface for the resiliencehub service, importing classes from local modules and setting up exports. The documentation provides usage examples, but no input/output handling or network interactions are present here. There are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a benign, standard Python module serving as an API interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, standard module serving as an interface for the resiliencehub service. It contains no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no indication of malicious intent.",
