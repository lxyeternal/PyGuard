  "purpose": "Main interface for resiliencehub service, providing classes and usage instructions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), static code with no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class aliasing; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright (2025), likely placeholder, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module defining an interface with imports, an alias, and export list. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. The documentation and structure are standard. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The future date is unusual but not malicious. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe interface module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should remain at 0.",
