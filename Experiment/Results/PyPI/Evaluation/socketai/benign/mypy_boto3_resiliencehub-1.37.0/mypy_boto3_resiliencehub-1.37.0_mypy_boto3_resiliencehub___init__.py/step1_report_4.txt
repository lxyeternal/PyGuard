  "anomalies": "Presence of copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, may suggest placeholder or outdated info; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module that imports classes and functions, defines an alias, and exposes certain elements via __all__. It contains no user input handling, network operations, or credential management. The documentation references external URLs and code examples, but these are standard and safe. There is no obfuscated or suspicious code. The overall structure is straightforward, serving as an interface layer with no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign, well-structured interface for the resiliencehub service, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
