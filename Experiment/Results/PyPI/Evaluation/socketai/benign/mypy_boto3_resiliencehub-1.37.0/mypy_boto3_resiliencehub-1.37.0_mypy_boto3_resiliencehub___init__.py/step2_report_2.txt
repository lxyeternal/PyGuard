  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward interface module, primarily importing classes and defining exports.\n   - The code does not contain any dynamic execution, network calls, or data processing that could be malicious.\n   - The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No report claims any suspicious or malicious behavior, which aligns with the code content.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports themselves.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - Since there's no malware or obfuscation, scores of 0 are justified.\n   - The high confidence score is appropriate because the analysis is thorough and the code is simple.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code is purely an interface with no vulnerabilities or malicious content.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware: 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions.\n   - The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - The assessments are uniform and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a standard, safe interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.**",
