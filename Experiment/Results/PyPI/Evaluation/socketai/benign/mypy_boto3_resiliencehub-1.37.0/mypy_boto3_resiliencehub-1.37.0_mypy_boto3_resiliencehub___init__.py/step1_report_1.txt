{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface module for resiliencehub service, exposing classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), string literals in documentation and comments, and module-level assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no signs of unusual or suspicious behavior. It includes a copyright notice from 2025, which may be a future date but not malicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports classes and functions related to the resiliencehub service from local modules, assigns a class to a variable named Client, and defines __all__ for module exports. The included docstring provides usage instructions and documentation links. There are no dynamic code execution, network connections, or data manipulations that could indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a clean, well-structured interface module for a larger SDK or package.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward API interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only exposes imported classes and functions, with no evident malicious code, backdoors, or sensitive operations. Overall, it appears safe.",
