{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the resiliencehub service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions, sys.version_info for Python version checking, and imports from botocore and local type_defs module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain untrusted input sources or data sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines classes and type annotations without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for type-annotated boto3 paginator definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version. It defines paginator classes that extend base classes with type annotations for response types. The paginate methods include detailed docstrings referencing boto3 documentation but contain no executable code beyond method signatures. There are no dynamic code executions, eval statements, or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code is straightforward and purely for type hinting and class definition.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginator wrappers. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves the purpose of enabling type-safe pagination in boto3 clients with no security concerns.",
