  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for resiliencehub service client, enabling typed pagination over AWS responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods using **kwargs for pagination.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks or network operations; methods are primarily type declarations.",
  "flows": "Class methods receive **kwargs with type annotations, then return paginated response iterators; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Use of Unpack for type annotations is standard. The code is primarily structural/type declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the resiliencehub AWS service with type annotations. It imports necessary modules, sets up conditional imports for compatibility, and defines classes with paginate methods. These methods are stubs that return iterators over response types. There are no external data manipulations, network operations, or security-sensitive actions within the code. The code is straightforward, primarily for type checking and documentation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as type declarations and class wrappers for AWS resiliencehub paginators. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It’s a standard pattern for type annotations in boto3 stubs, with no suspicious activity.",
