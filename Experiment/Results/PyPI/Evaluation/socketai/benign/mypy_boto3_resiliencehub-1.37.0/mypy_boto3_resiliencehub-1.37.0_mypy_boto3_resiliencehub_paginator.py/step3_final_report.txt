  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 resiliencehub paginators, facilitating type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance, method signatures, and type annotation definitions; no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external effects.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (**kwargs) pass into boto3 API calls, but this is standard for boto3 paginators.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation links. It accepts **kwargs to pass request parameters into boto3's paginator methods, which is typical. No runtime data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is purely structural, serving as type hints and class wrappers for boto3 SDK. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of boto3 paginator stubs with correct type annotations. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The passing of **kwargs into API calls is normal and not indicative of malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
