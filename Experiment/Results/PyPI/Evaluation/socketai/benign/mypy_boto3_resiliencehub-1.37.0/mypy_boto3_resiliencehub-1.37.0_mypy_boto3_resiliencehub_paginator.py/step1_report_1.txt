  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for resiliencehub service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API calls.",
  "sources": "Imported modules, especially sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; functions primarily define class structures and type annotations.",
  "flows": "The code sets up class inheritance and method signatures for paginators; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for boto3 stubs; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or backdoors detected. Conditional import of Unpack is appropriate for Python version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations for paginator classes in boto3's resiliencehub client, including multiple class inheritance and method signatures with type unpacking. All imports are standard for type hinting and version compatibility. No external data or user inputs are processed. The functions only override 'paginate' methods with proper type annotations. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or contain suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginator stubs. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The implementation aligns with standard practices for type hinting and backward compatibility. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
