  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for the resiliencehub service client to facilitate paginated API calls with type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external modules (sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs). It also utilizes class methods and attributes that involve data passed as **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The paginate() methods accept **kwargs that are unpacked into API requests; no direct use of untrusted data is observed, but the data flows into boto3's Paginator which executes external API calls.",
  "flows": "User calls paginate() with parameters → parameters are unpacked and passed to boto3 Paginator → external API requests are made.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code strictly defines paginator classes with type annotations, adhering to standard boto3 and type hint patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on defining paginator classes with correct type annotations and documentation. It imports standard libraries and boto3 modules, and conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version. The classes inherit from Paginator with specific type parameters, and their paginate() methods accept **kwargs unpacked into request parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network connections outside expected APIs, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure aligns with typical boto3 stub implementations. The code appears to be a well-structured, type-safe wrapper around boto3's paginators, with no anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of paginator class wrappers with type annotations for the resiliencehub service. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
