  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for resiliencehub service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods with **kwargs for pagination.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs which are unpacked into request parameters.",
  "flows": "Input via **kwargs flows directly into the paginate methods, which call the underlying paginator. No direct data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code primarily consists of class definitions, type annotations, and documentation strings. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations for a boto3 service client, including conditional imports based on Python version. The classes inherit from Paginator and override the paginate method, which unpacks input parameters for paginated API calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior; the code appears to serve as a type-safe interface layer for boto3 paginators. All components seem standard and documented, with no suspicious data handling or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented set of paginator class definitions with type annotations for boto3 resiliencehub service. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contains no malware, and poses no security risks. It is safe to use as intended for type-safe API pagination.",
