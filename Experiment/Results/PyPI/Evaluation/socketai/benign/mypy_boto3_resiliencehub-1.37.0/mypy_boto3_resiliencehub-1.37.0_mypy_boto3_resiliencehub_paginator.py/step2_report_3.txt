  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided details.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code is for type annotations and paginator class definitions for resiliencehub, with no external data or user input.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data is processed; classes only define structure.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is standard, with no backdoors, secrets, or suspicious constructs. Conditional import of Unpack is appropriate for Python version compatibility.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate, and aligned with standard practices.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and paginator classes, with standard imports.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; only class definitions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, straightforward code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard, with no security concerns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines typed paginator classes with some unpacking of **kwargs, which are passed into boto3's paginator.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** The **kwargs are user-supplied but only used as request parameters in boto3 API calls.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The use of **kwargs is standard for boto3 paginators.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured, type-safe wrapper with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the slight risk score reflects that **kwargs are user input, but this is typical for API request parameters, not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with type annotations and class definitions, using **kwargs for pagination.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input flows into boto3's paginator; no untrusted data processing beyond API request parameters.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard boto3 stub pattern.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines paginator classes with type annotations, similar structure.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or external data processing; **kwargs are request parameters.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard pattern.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the small risk score is justifiable as **kwargs are user input, but this is normal for API calls.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are 0, with a couple at 0.1 due to the use of **kwargs. This is reasonable because **kwargs can accept user input, but in this context, it’s just passing parameters to an API, not executing untrusted code or exfiltrating data.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present.\n- Use of conditional imports and type annotations is standard.\n- The small risk score reflects typical user input passing but does not indicate actual security risk.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n**The code is safe, standard, and legitimate.**  \n**Scores should remain at:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to user input potential, but not malicious)\n\n**No changes needed.**",
