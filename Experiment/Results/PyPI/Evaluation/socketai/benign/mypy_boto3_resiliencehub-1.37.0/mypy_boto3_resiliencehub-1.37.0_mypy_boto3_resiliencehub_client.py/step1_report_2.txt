  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the resiliencehub service in boto3, facilitating type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class definitions and method signatures; property and method decorators.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, external network calls, or sensitive data processing evident in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A — primarily interface and type definitions with method signatures, no data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code strictly defines client interfaces and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for a boto3 client, including property and method overloads. It imports necessary modules, defines exception classes, and documents each method with links to documentation. There are no operations performing data manipulation, network activity, or executing untrusted input. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The structure is standard for generated type stub files. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structured interface definition for the resiliencehub boto3 client with extensive type annotations and documentation links. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
