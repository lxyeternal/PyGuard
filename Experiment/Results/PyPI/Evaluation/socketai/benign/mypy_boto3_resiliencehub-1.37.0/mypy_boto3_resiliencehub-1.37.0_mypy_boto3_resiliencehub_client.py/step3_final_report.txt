  "purpose": "Type annotations for resiliencehub service Client.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (mostly **kwargs) unpacked from request type definitions, documentation links, and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "Methods accepting untrusted input via **kwargs, such as accept_resource_grouping_recommendations, add_draft_app_version_resource_mappings, etc., which could potentially be misused if called maliciously. No network or data exfiltration outside AWS SDK.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK method calls; no dynamic code execution or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns. Standard SDK interface with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type annotations and a client class wrapping AWS ResilienceHub API calls. It contains no executable logic beyond method signatures, no data processing, no network activity outside the SDK, and no obfuscated or malicious code. All signals point to a standard, generated SDK interface intended for type safety and IDE support. The unpacked request types are data containers, not executable code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, safe SDK interface for AWS ResilienceHub. It does not contain malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, all being zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
