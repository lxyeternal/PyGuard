{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the resiliencehub service, enabling type checking and IDE support for the boto3 client.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property definitions that describe client behavior and structure.",
  "sinks": "Methods that send or receive data, especially network calls via boto3, which could potentially be exploited if malicious data is injected or if the methods are hijacked.",
  "flows": "Method calls that invoke boto3 operations, utilizing input parameters (kwargs) to interact with AWS services, with potential for malicious data injection if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors observed. Methods are straightforward and conform to boto3 client patterns. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious code patterns. The license and copyright note are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Python class for the boto3 resiliencehub client with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. It imports standard and third-party libraries, including conditional imports based on Python version. The class provides numerous methods corresponding to AWS operations, with no custom logic or data manipulation. The only notable point is the use of method signatures with kwargs unpacking, typical for boto3 clients, which could accept untrusted data if called with malicious input. There are no network operations, file I/O, or suspicious code. The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated or hand-written interface for AWS SDK, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, type-annotated interface for the AWS resiliencehub client, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily provides structured access to AWS operations with no embedded malicious logic.",
