{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the ResilienceHub service, enabling type-checked interactions with the AWS Resilience Hub API via boto3.",
  "sources": "The code sources include import statements for various boto3 and botocore modules, type definitions, and the class methods that wrap API calls with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "API methods that invoke AWS service operations, primarily through the 'self' object. No untrusted data is explicitly processed or outputted to external sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided parameters (via **kwargs) into the API methods, which pass these parameters directly to AWS API calls. No evidence of untrusted data handling or malicious injection flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be standard type annotation and method wrapping for a service client. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables are present. All imports and class structures are consistent with generated boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class with methods corresponding to AWS ResilienceHub API operations, all annotated with detailed type hints. It includes property methods and overloaded methods for paginators. No signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The only inputs are method parameters, which are strictly typed and passed directly to AWS. No suspicious or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, autogenerated boto3 stub class providing type-safe method signatures for AWS ResilienceHub API interactions. It contains no malicious intent or security risks, serving purely as a type annotation layer for the AWS SDK. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
