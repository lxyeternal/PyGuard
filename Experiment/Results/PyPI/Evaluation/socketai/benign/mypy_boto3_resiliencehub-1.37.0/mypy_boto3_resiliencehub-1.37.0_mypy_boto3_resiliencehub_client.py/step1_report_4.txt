{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with AWS Resilience Hub service, providing methods to manage applications, resources, policies, assessments, and related entities.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; method parameters unpacked from various type defs; method implementations calling AWS API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Methods that make API calls or generate URLs, which could potentially handle untrusted data if user-controlled input is passed via kwargs. No direct untrusted data sources or sinks like network connections or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from **kwargs are unpacked into API request payloads; these are sent to AWS services, which are considered trusted endpoints. No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is primarily a structured interface to an external API, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS Resilience Hub, with methods corresponding to AWS API operations. It uses standard Python type hints, overloads, and property decorators. The implementation details are absent, indicating this is an interface/SDK layer. No indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The imports and class structure are standard for a generated or SDK-like client. No malicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard API client interface for AWS Resilience Hub with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It serves as a type-safe wrapper around AWS API calls, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
