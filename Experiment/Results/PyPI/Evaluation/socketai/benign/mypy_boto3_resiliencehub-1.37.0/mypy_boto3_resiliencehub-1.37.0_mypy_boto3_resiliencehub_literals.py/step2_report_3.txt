  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the purpose, and the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines static string literal types for constants in resiliencehub. No external input or dynamic data.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Straightforward static type alias definitions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data processing.\n- **Conclusion & Security Risk:** The code is purely static, with no malicious behavior. The minimal risk score (0) is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining type annotations for AWS resource constants.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no external data, no obfuscation. Standard pattern for static type definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Security Risk:** No signs of malicious activity. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Security risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS resource name literals and enums for type safety.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no external input, no obfuscation. The conditional import of `Literal` is standard for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion & Security Risk:** No malicious behavior detected. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions for AWS constants.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime code, no external data, no obfuscation. Standard static type alias pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Security Risk:** No signs of malicious intent. Risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literals for resiliencehub identifiers and statuses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no external data, no obfuscation. Static type definitions only.\n- **Conclusion & Security Risk:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected. Risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe static, straightforward type alias definitions for AWS constants, with no dynamic behavior, no input/output, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** Given the nature of the code, the security risk is effectively zero.\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and the overall risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk in static type definitions)\n\nThis module functions solely as a static type annotation repository, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign, static collection of string literal type aliases for AWS resiliencehub constants, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are reasonable and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal security risk.",
