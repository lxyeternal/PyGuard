{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for resiliencehub service literals to ensure type safety and code clarity when using boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various string-based types, imported from conditional typing_extensions or built-in typing depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data or external effects; the code only defines type literals.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code purely declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal types representing AWS resource names, statuses, and other enumerations. The entire code is focused on type annotations for better static analysis and code quality. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or code execution beyond type alias declarations. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is detected. The file is well-structured, uses common patterns, and appears to be a legitimate part of a boto3 stub library.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions for AWS resource and status string literals, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical, safe type definition module for static type checking purposes.",
