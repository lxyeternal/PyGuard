  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any potential security concerns, inconsistencies, or anomalies.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static string literals for AWS resiliencehub constants; no external input.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** The code is straightforward, defining static type aliases. No dynamic code, no data flow, no external dependencies beyond conditional import for Python version compatibility.  \n- **Conclusion & Risk:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code is purely for static type safety.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The risk score of 0 and malware score of 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type alias definitions for AWS resource constants.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No input/output, no dynamic behavior, no obfuscation. The conditional import of 'Literal' is standard for compatibility.  \n- **Conclusion & Risk:** No malicious intent or security concerns.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The risk and malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS ResilienceHub constants as string literals for type safety.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No data flow, no external dependencies, no suspicious code. The code is purely static type annotations.  \n- **Conclusion & Risk:** No malicious behavior or security issues detected.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type definitions for AWS resource identifiers.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no external data, no obfuscation. The conditional import is standard.  \n- **Conclusion & Risk:** No signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.  \n- **Assessment:** Scores are suitable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type alias definitions for AWS resiliencehub and related constants.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no data flow, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion & Risk:** No malicious or security concerns.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no malicious behavior or code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward static definitions.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of dynamic behavior, external data handling, or any suspicious patterns, a risk score of 0 is appropriate for all.\n\n### Overall:\n\nThe code in question is a static type alias module defining string literals for AWS services and statuses. It contains no executable logic, no data flow, no external dependencies beyond version-compatible imports, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe and serves a purely documentation and static analysis purpose.",
