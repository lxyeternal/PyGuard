{
  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for AWS resiliencehub constants and related identifiers to enable type safety and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals within the module; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions without data processing or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type alias definitions with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias declarations using Literal for various AWS resource names, statuses, and identifiers. There is no dynamic code, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The conditional import of 'Literal' is standard for compatibility across Python versions. The module serves purely as a static type annotation resource, with no executable logic or data flow that could introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static type safety utility for AWS resource constants. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
