{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various identifiers, statuses, and configurations related to the resiliencehub service, ensuring type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Read-only definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases, mainly from static data within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data is processed or passed to external systems; the code only defines types.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as there is no runtime logic, data processing, or external input/output involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies; it is purely static type definitions with no executable logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations for various string-based identifiers and statuses used in a larger system. It conditionally imports the 'Literal' type from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. All definitions are static and straightforward, with no data processing, user input, or external calls. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a type-stubbing or API schema definition for static analysis or IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks within this code. It is a safe, static set of type aliases for documentation and type checking purposes only.",
