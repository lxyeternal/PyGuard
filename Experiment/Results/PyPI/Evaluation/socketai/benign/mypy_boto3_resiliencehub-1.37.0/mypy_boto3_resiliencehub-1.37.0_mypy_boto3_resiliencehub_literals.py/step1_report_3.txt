{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS ResilienceHub service-related constants and enumerations, primarily for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports sys module; conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions; defines multiple Literal type aliases with string constants.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only defines constants and type aliases without processing untrusted input or executing data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code strictly defines static type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. The code's structure is straightforward and typical for type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines a comprehensive set of string literal types representing AWS service names, regions, statuses, and other enums. These are static type annotations used for type checking. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions for AWS ResilienceHub-related constants. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as a utility module for type safety in larger codebases.",
