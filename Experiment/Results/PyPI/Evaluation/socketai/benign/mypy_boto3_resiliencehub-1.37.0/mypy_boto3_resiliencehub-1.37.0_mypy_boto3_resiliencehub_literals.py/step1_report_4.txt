{
  "purpose": "Defines various type literals for resiliencehub service and other AWS resource identifiers to facilitate type checking and code validation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various string-based enumerations used in the module.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code only defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the module serves solely as a type definition library.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version; no malicious anomalies detected. The license comment appears unrelated to code behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static type definitions using Python's Literal types for various string enumerations relevant to AWS resilience hub and other services. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. No runtime execution or data manipulation occurs. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is purely declarative, serving as a type-safe enumeration repository.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition module providing string literals for type annotations. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It is a standard pattern for type safety in Python projects, especially for SDKs or API wrappers.",
