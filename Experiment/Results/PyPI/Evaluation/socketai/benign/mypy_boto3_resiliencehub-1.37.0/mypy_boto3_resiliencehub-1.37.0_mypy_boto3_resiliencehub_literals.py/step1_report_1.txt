{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various constants used in the resiliencehub service for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions are static and hardcoded within the module; no external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward, defining string literals based on AWS service constants. The version check for 'Literal' import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal types for AWS resiliencehub related constants. No dynamic code, no input/output operations, no cryptic or obfuscated constructs. The purpose is static type annotation support for other code modules. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The license and documentation comments are standard and do not raise concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This module purely contains static type definitions for constants, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a type-safe enumeration of AWS-related string constants, suitable for static analysis and code completion. Overall security risk is minimal.",
