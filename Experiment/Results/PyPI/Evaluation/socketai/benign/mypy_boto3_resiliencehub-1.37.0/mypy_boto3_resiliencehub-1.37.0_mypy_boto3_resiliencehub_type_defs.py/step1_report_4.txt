  "purpose": "Type definitions for resiliencehub service, providing structured data schemas for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Defines data structures; reads no external input, environment variables, or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses data structures as output schemas; no sink functions or data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Contains extensive type definitions with no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No suspicious code behaviors such as network connections or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of Python type annotations and TypedDict definitions for API request and response schemas. No executable code, system calls, or external interactions are included. The structure is static and standard for type hinting purposes. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of third-party typing extensions is appropriate and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of data schema definitions for a Python service SDK. It is purely for type safety and documentation, with no executable or malicious code present. The absence of runtime logic, network activity, or environment manipulation indicates a clean and safe code base.",
