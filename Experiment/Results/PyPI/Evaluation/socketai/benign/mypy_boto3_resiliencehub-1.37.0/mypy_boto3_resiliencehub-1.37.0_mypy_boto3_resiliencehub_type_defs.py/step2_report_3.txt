  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as static type annotations, data structure definitions, and request/response schemas for the resiliencehub SDK or API client.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external I/O, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated or carefully crafted for type safety and documentation purposes.\n- The confidence levels are high (close to 1), and malware/security risks are consistently zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is purely static type definitions with no executable or malicious code.\n\n### Logical/Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes:** None detected. The code is well-structured, with conditional imports for compatibility, and the type annotations follow standard practices.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, declarative nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the absence of runtime logic or external data handling.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:\n- The reports challenge no claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions. They correctly identify that the code is static and purely declarative.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### My Reasoned Estimate:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, static, and safe.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for the resiliencehub SDK, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and purely for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
