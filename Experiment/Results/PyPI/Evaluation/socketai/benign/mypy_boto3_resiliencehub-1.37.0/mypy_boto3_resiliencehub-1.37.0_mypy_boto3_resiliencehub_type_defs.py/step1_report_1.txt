{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations and data structures for the resiliencehub service, including request and response types, data models, and constants, to facilitate type-safe interactions within the SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and typing_extensions; definitions of TypedDict classes and type aliases; static data structures for request and response types.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted input directly; the code primarily consists of type definitions and static data structures without runtime data processing or external I/O.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the code purely defines types and data models used elsewhere in an application or SDK.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. All code appears to be standard type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static type annotations and data structure definitions using Python's typing system. No executable logic, input parsing, or runtime operations are present. The imported modules and type aliases are used solely for type safety. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be an auto-generated or hand-crafted schema for API request/response modeling, typical for SDKs or API clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining data types and static structures for resiliencehub service interactions. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. Overall, it is a standard type definitions module with no security issues.",
