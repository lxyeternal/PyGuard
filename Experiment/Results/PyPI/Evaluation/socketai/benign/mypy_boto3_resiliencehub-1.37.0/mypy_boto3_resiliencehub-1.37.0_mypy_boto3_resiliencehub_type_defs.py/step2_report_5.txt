  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided reports and the code:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and import statements.  \n   - No runtime logic, data processing, external input handling, or dynamic code execution is present.  \n   - The data structures appear comprehensive and aligned with typical SDK or API schema definitions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   - The reports are consistent in asserting that the code is purely static type definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.  \n   - The reports correctly identify the absence of executable logic, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature of the code.  \n   - Risk scores are also low or zero, aligning with the absence of runtime or external interactions.  \n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \n   - Since the code contains only type annotations and data schemas, there is no basis for elevated risk scores.  \n   - No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscation**  \n   - All reports correctly identify malware and obfuscation scores as zero.  \n   - The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard Python typing constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - The reports avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they rely on static analysis of code content.  \n   - They accurately state that the code is benign and primarily serves as type definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores and Analysis**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no runtime logic.  \n   - The high confidence scores reflect thorough and accurate assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or payloads detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard patterns.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified; purely static type definitions.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the resiliencehub SDK. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
