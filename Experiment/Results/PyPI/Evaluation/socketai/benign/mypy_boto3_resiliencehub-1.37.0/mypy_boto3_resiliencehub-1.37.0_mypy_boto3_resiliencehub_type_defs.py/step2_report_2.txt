  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided reports and the code to identify any potential security issues, anomalies, or malicious indicators.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict definitions, constants, and import statements.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external I/O, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears to be an auto-generated or manually crafted schema for API request/response validation within an SDK or client library.\n- No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The code is well-structured, uses conditional imports for compatibility, and adheres to standard typing practices.\n\n**Specific Observations:**\n- All imports are from standard or well-known typing modules.\n- No external inputs are processed at runtime; the code only defines data structures.\n- The comments and documentation are consistent with typical SDK type definitions.\n- The \"malware\" score assigned by the reports is 0 across all, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, indicating no obfuscation or hidden code patterns.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The code does not contain any runtime logic, so it cannot execute malicious actions.\n- The presence of extensive type definitions is typical for SDKs and does not introduce security risks.\n- No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or environment modifications, are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All evidence points to this being a benign, purely declarative module for type safety and API schema validation.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed; the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for a Python SDK or API client, with no security concerns.",
