{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for resiliencehub service type definitions, primarily for data validation and API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (__future__, sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions), literals, and type definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data processing or external outputs are present. The code only defines data types without executing external commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist as the code is solely type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are detected. Usage of type annotations and the definition of data structures are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only type annotations, data structure definitions, and import statements for typing modules, all consistent with a typical SDK or API client library. No code executes outside of data validation, and there are no dynamic or malicious code execution patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs are present. The initial comment suggests it's for documentation and type definitions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All the type definitions and imports follow standard patterns and are purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the resiliencehub service. It contains no executable or malicious code, no obfuscated patterns, and no signs of malicious intent. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK component or type definitions file for API validation.",
