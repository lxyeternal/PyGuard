{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for resiliencehub service data structures, primarily for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines data type structures using TypedDict and imports from standard and external typing modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or execution points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow exists as the code is purely declarative with type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It includes standard type annotations, conditional imports based on sys.version_info, and a comprehensive set of data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines numerous TypedDict classes to specify data structures for the resiliencehub API. It employs conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, and uses constants and type annotations to create clear, explicit data models. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, and no evident logic or control flow. All constructs are standard for defining structured types in Python. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of static type definitions for the resiliencehub service, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely as a typing aid and does not perform any runtime actions or contain any malicious logic.",
