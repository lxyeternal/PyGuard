  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for resiliencehub service type definitions, facilitating type checking and data validation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, type literals, and defines various TypedDict data structures, constants, and unions. Reads configuration, type annotations, and static data.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No code executes untrusted input or performs data output operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data definitions and type annotations, with no execution or data processing logic that could lead to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, data structure definitions, and imports. No runtime logic, user input handling, or external data manipulation exists. It employs standard practices for defining complex data types using TypedDict, Union, and Literal. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are present. The inclusion of copyright info and documentation indicates it's intended for structured type definitions in a SDK or API client context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type annotations and data definitions for the resiliencehub service. It does not contain executable code, input/output operations, or dynamic logic that could be malicious. No malicious activity or sabotage identified.",
