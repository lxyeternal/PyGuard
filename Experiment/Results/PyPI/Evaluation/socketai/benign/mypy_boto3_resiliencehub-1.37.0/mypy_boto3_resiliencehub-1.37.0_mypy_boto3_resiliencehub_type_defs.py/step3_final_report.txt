{
  "purpose": "Static type annotations for resiliencehub service type definitions, serving as schema for API request/response validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard typing modules, literals, and type definitions; no runtime data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external output; purely static data models.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only defines data structures without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility. It functions as schema definitions for an SDK or API client, with no runtime logic, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. The extensive use of type annotations and structured data models aligns with standard SDK practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative, and serves as a schema for API interactions. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
