  "purpose": "Implementing Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) for sorting strings according to Unicode standards.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.collator), usage example with string sorting.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms shown.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code primarily contains class import and usage example, no data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs. Usage of relative import suggests code is part of a larger package but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module-level docstring describing the purpose of implementing UCA. It imports the Collator class from a relative module, and provides an example usage of creating a Collator instance and sorting a list of words. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and consistent with standard Python practices. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation example for Unicode string sorting. It does not contain malware, malicious code, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
