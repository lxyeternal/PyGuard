{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python 3 implementation of the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA), with usage instructions and an import statement for the Collator class.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .collator and the module docstring.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports a class and contains documentation.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with a descriptive docstring and a simple import statement. No executable logic, data handling, or network activity is present. The import from a local module is standard in package development. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured module with no malicious behavior or security issues. The import statement and documentation are standard, and no anomalies are present. The overall security risk is effectively zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
