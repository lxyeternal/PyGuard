      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Trie implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores from the reports are consistent with this assessment; however, the security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 slightly overstates the actual risk. Adjusting this to 0 aligns with the benign nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Unicode collation library with no malicious activity or backdoors. It relies on external data files, which is standard for localization and collation purposes. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.2), reflecting typical risks associated with external data dependencies but no active malicious behavior."
