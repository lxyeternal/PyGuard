  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious components, logical consistency, and appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Implements Unicode collation, loads data from a local file, processes Unicode strings into collation keys. No external network or data output.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, regex parsing appears standard, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly describes a legitimate Unicode collation implementation with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is standard, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n- **Risk score justification:** The overall security risk is low (~0.1), as it only processes data locally.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1—loads collation data from a file, processes Unicode strings, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, standard Unicode processing, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard implementation; malware score 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n- **Risk justification:** No external communication or malicious activity; low risk (~0.2).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Loads collation data from external files, processes Unicode strings into sort keys.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious code, no network or data exfiltration, standard data handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid Unicode collation code, malware score 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n- **Risk justification:** Similar low risk (~0.2).\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Loads data from external files based on UCA version, processes strings for collation.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No malicious patterns, no external communication, standard Unicode handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate implementation, malware score 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious intent or backdoors.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n- **Risk justification:** Low, primarily due to reliance on external data files, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Loads collation data from files, processes Unicode strings, no network or external command execution.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard Unicode processing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid Unicode collation implementation, malware score 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n- **Risk justification:** Low risk (~0.2).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, which is consistent with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (~0.1 to 0.2), appropriate given the code's function.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 for all reports — no signs of malicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — code is clear and understandable.\n\n**Risk score:** Considering the code only processes local data, performs Unicode normalization, and generates sort keys without external communication or data exfiltration, a conservative estimate would be around **0.1 to 0.2** for each report, aligning with the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a legitimate Unicode collation implementation with no malicious or obfuscated components. The current scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No adjustments necessary.",
