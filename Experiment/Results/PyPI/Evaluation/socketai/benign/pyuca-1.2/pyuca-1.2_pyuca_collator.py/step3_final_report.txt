{
  "purpose": "Implements Unicode collation by loading collation data from external files, normalizing strings, and generating sort keys for Unicode strings.",
  "sources": "Reads Unicode collation data from 'allkeys-{UCA_VERSION}.txt' files in the local directory; processes input strings into code points.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external network or data output; no malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Loads data from files -> processes strings into code points -> builds collation elements -> generates sort keys.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; regex for parsing data is standard; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads Unicode collation data from local files based on UCA version, processes Unicode strings into collation elements, and generates sort keys for sorting. It performs normalization and uses a Trie data structure for efficient lookup. There are no external network calls, no code injection, or data exfiltration. The regex parsing and data handling are standard. The code is transparent, well-structured, and aligns with typical Unicode collation implementations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The reliance on external data files is typical for such libraries and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Unicode collation library with no malicious activity or backdoors. It relies on external data files, which is standard for localization and collation purposes. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.2), reflecting typical risks associated with external data dependencies but no active malicious behavior.",
