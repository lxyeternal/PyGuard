  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, purely for data formatting, with no external I/O, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The functions perform simple conversions and formatting, with no signs of code injection, dynamic execution, or backdoors.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all indicate zero malware and security risk.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code itself is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The functions do not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities; they are purely formatting utilities.\n\n**Potential points of critique:**\n- While the reports are thorough, they could emphasize that the functions accept data that could be manipulated externally but are used solely for display purposes, which minimizes security concern.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation is present.\n- The \"malware\" score of 0 is justified; no malicious code is detected.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is safe, clean, and purely for debugging and formatting purposes.",
