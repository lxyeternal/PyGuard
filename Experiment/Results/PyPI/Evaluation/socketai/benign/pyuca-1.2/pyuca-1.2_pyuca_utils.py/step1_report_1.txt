  "purpose": "Utilities for formatting data structures used in pyuca, primarily for debugging output.",
  "sources": "Input data for functions: hexstrings (list of hex string), number_list (list of integers), collation_elements (list of list of integers), sort_key (list of integers). No external sources are explicitly read from files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations involve converting data formats, mainly for display or debugging purposes. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through format functions, converting hex strings to integers, integers to hex strings, and formatting data structures for display. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks such as system commands or insecure storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The functions perform straightforward data formatting with no unusual or obfuscated code. No use of dynamic execution or reflection.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for converting hex string lists to integers and vice versa, formatting nested lists of integers as strings, and formatting a list of integers as a string with level separators. The functions include docstrings with examples, indicating expected behavior. The code is simple, with no external I/O, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The functions are typical for debugging or display purposes and do not involve any external dependencies or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for formatting data structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe for use within the larger pyuca project.",
