  "purpose": "Utilities for formatting and converting data structures used in pyuca, primarily for debugging output.",
  "sources": "Function inputs such as hexstrings, number_list, collation_elements, and sort_key; none of these are from untrusted external sources directly, but could be manipulated data passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that produce formatted strings, which are not sinks for untrusted data in terms of security risk; no system commands, network connections, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through conversion and formatting functions, resulting in formatted strings. No data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data conversion and formatting functions, converting hex strings to integers, integers to hex strings, formatting collation elements, and formatting sort keys. The functions perform basic, deterministic transformations without side effects or external interactions. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident. The functions are well-structured, with docstrings and examples, and do not process untrusted sources in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly for formatting and data conversion, with no malicious or security-related issues identified. It appears safe and intended solely for debugging and data representation.",
