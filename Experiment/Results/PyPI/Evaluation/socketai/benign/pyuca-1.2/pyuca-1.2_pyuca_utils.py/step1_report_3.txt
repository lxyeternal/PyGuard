  "purpose": "Utilities for formatting data structures used in pyuca, mainly for debugging output.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as hexstrings, number_list, collation_elements, sort_key; input is provided through function calls and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to potential data leaks or security effects; no untrusted external data or output to insecure channels are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting functions to string outputs. No untrusted data flows to external systems or insecure functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The functions perform straightforward data formatting without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of helper functions converting hex strings to integers, integers to hex strings, formatting collation elements, and formatting sort keys. All functions operate purely on input data and produce formatted string outputs. No external network access, environment variable usage, or unsafe operations are present. The functions serve debugging purposes and do not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It simply provides data formatting utilities without any suspicious or harmful features.",
