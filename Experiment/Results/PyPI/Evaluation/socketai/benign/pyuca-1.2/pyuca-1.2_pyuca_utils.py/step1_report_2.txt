  "purpose": "Utilities for formatting data structures used in pyuca, mainly for debugging output.",
  "sources": "Input data in functions such as hexstrings (list of hex strings), number_list (list of integers), collation_elements (list of list of integers), and sort_key (list of integers).",
  "sinks": "None of the functions involve executing untrusted data or writing data to external systems. The functions perform data formatting and conversion, which are safe operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to formatted string outputs without executing or evaluating the data beyond formatting conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward, mainly performing data conversions and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for converting between hex strings and integers, formatting collation elements, and formatting sort keys. All operations are standard data transformations with no evaluation or execution of external input beyond simple conversions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed. The functions serve debugging purposes and do not perform any network activity, data leakage, or privilege escalation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of data formatting utilities without any malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.",
