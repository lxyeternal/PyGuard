  "purpose": "Implementation of a Trie data structure for storing and retrieving key-value pairs based on prefix matching.",
  "sources": "Input keys in add() method; key parameter in find_prefix() method.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in find_prefix() outputs parts of the key and associated value; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input keys flow through add() to populate nodes; find_prefix() traverses nodes based on key parts, returning prefix, value, and remaining key segments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Trie implementation with standard methods for adding entries and prefix searching. It uses in-memory data structures without external interactions. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's logic is clear, and the absence of network activity or data leaks indicates low risk. The only minor point is the return of key segments and associated values, which could be misused if misinterpreted, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Trie implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores from the reports are consistent with this assessment; however, the security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 slightly overstates the actual risk. Adjusting this to 0 aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
