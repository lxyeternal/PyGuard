  "purpose": "Implementation of a Trie data structure for storing and retrieving values based on prefix matching.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'key' and 'value' in add(), and 'key' in find_prefix().",
  "sinks": "Return values from find_prefix(), no direct untrusted data sink evident.",
  "flows": "add() method: key + value input → stores in Trie nodes; find_prefix() method: key input → searches and returns prefix, value, and suffix.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no unusual runtime behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Trie with methods to add key-value pairs and find prefix matches. It uses __slots__ for memory efficiency. The add() method creates nested nodes as needed; find_prefix() searches for the longest prefix with an associated value. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code performs standard Trie operations without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Trie data structure with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
