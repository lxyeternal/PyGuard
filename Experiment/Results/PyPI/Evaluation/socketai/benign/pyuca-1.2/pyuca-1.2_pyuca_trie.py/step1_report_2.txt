  "purpose": "Implementation of a Trie data structure for storing and searching key-value pairs with prefix matching.",
  "sources": "User input keys provided to add() and find_prefix() methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input keys flow into add() and find_prefix() methods, traversing internal nodes; no data flow to external systems or output that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Trie with methods to add key-value pairs and find prefixes. It uses in-memory data structures with no network operations, external system calls, or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code logic are present. The code does not contain any obfuscation or suspicious patterns. It performs basic data storage and retrieval tasks securely within its scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a Trie data structure without any malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward, with no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities detected based on the provided code.",
