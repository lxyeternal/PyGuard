  "purpose": "Implementation of a Trie (prefix tree) data structure for storing and searching key-value pairs with prefix matching.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'key' (for add and find_prefix functions), potentially external input to these functions.",
  "sinks": "Return values from find_prefix (partial key, associated value, remaining key). No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to security issues are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'key' flows into add and find_prefix methods, being processed through iteration; data may be returned from find_prefix.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or unusual language features. The code appears straightforward, standard implementation of a Trie.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Trie data structure with nodes, supporting add and prefix search operations. Nodes are stored efficiently using __slots__, reducing memory footprint. The add method inserts keys with associated values, creating nodes as needed. The find_prefix method searches for the longest prefix match and returns the matched prefix, its value, and remaining key. There are no external data sources, no network operations, or any suspicious behavior. The code is a typical Trie implementation without malicious or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Trie data structure implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs prefix-based insertions and searches, which are common in many applications. There are no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
