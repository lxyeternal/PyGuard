  "purpose": "Implementation of a Trie data structure for storing and retrieving values based on prefix matching.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to 'add' method (key, value), input parameter to 'find_prefix' method (key).",
  "sinks": "Return statements in 'find_prefix' and 'add' methods; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'key' flows into 'add' and 'find_prefix' methods; internal traversal of trie structure; outputs are prefix matches and associated values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no unusual or obfuscated code. The implementation appears straightforward and typical of a trie data structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic trie with node class having 'value' and 'children'. The 'add' method inserts keys with associated values, creating new nodes as needed. The 'find_prefix' method searches for the longest prefix match within the trie. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of 'setdefault' for node insertion is standard. No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code. The code functions solely as a data structure implementation without external dependencies or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a trie data structure with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
