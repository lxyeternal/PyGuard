  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Trie implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores from the reports are consistent with this assessment; however, the security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 slightly overstates the actual risk. Adjusting this to 0 aligns with the benign nature of the code."
