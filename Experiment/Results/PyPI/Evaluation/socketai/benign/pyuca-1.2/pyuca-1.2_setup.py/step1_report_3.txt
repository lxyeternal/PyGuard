{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and data files for the pyuca Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, package data files (allkeys-*.txt), and imports from setuptools.",
  "buffers": "No untrusted data sources or user inputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures detected. The package data files are static and known.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, specifying metadata, data files, and classifiers. It imports only the 'setuptools' library and calls setup() with fixed strings and lists. There are no dynamic or runtime behaviors, no external inputs, and no code execution beyond package configuration. The package data files are explicitly listed, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup configuration script for packaging Python code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
