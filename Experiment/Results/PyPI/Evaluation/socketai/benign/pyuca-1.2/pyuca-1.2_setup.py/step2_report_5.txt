  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data processing is involved.\n- The package data files are static and appear to be resource files related to Unicode collation.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code uses standard practices with setuptools.\n\n**Issue presence confirmation:**\n- The code matches the descriptions; all package data files and metadata are static.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident in the code.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware` = 0\n  - `obfuscated` = 0\n  - `securityRisk` = 0\n  - `confidence` = 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports justify higher scores because the code is benign.\n- The code does not perform any runtime operations, data handling, or dynamic behaviors that could pose security risks.\n\n**Malware score:**\n- Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- The code is clear, static, and standard; obfuscation is not present, so 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- Given the above, the overall security risk should be 0, reflecting no threat.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on static analysis; no assumptions about hidden behaviors are made.\n- The package data files are standard and static, with no indication of malicious content.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All reports are consistent; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No security concerns.\n- No need for score adjustments.\n- The code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
