  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or runtime data handling are present.\n- The package data files are static, versioned text files, likely used for Unicode collation.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms no malicious intent, static package data, standard setup.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup, static data, no suspicious code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup, static files, no dynamic behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same findings: benign, static configuration.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others, confirms benign nature.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify zero malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a typical package setup script with no security concerns.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the reports are accurate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
