{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging the 'pyuca' Python library, specifying metadata, package data, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package data files such as 'allkeys-<version>.txt' and metadata fields like name, version, author, etc.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the setup script primarily handles metadata and package inclusion, not runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading package data files specified in 'package_data' and metadata for distribution; no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The package data files are static and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools setup() to define a package. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, no suspicious behavior observed. Package data includes text files with version numbers, typical for a localization or Unicode-related package. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. All elements align with common package configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any runtime operations or data manipulations that could be harmful.",
