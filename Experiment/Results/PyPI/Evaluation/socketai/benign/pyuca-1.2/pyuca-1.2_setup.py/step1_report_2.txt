  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for the 'pyuca' Python project, including metadata and package data files.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the 'setup' function, such as package data files and metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the setup configuration itself does not process untrusted data or perform runtime operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only declares package metadata and data files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata, data files, and classifiers. It specifies data files that seem to be static resource files (allkeys-*.txt). There are no input handling, environment variable use, or dynamic code execution. All components align with standard package setup procedures. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward Python package setup configuration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and intended for packaging purposes.",
