{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'pyuca' Python library, specifying metadata, package data files, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static package data files ('allkeys-<version>.txt') included via 'package_data', metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, and URL.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to typical packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with static metadata and data files. No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or runtime data processing is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0, with high confidence. The package data files are versioned text resources related to Unicode collation, with no malicious content. The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently safe.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All evidence and reports are consistent, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
