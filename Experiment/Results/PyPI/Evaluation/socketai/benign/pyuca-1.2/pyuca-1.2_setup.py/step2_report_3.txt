  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or runtime data handling is present.\n- The package data files are static, versioned text files likely used for Unicode collation.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any issues or vulnerabilities.\n- The package data files are static and safe.\n- The code is purely declarative, configuring package metadata and data files.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n- No misinterpretation or overreach in any report.\n\n### Score Assessments:\n- The **malware** scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are all 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are all 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since all evidence points to a benign, static setup script, there's no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.0.\n- The package data files are just versioned text files, with no signs of malicious content.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly identify that there's no malicious behavior or dynamic data handling.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on static inspection.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package. All reports are consistent and accurate. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
