  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of the pythondialog library to create simple terminal dialog boxes for user interaction.",
  "sources": "Locale setting, dialog initialization, user input functions (msgbox, yesno, inputbox), and response handling.",
  "sinks": "Display functions output to terminal; no untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Locale setting -> dialog initialization -> display message -> user response -> display response -> exit.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic, non-malicious example of using pythondialog for user interaction. It does not perform network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logic is simple, handling user responses and displaying messages accordingly. All signals point to benign, educational use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign demonstration with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
