  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, straightforward setup utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly assess the code as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and low risk scores (~0.1-0.2) justified by external command invocation. No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary."
