  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets locale, then uses the dialog library to create a menu with three options. It captures the user's choice and responds with message boxes accordingly. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious behavior. The library used is for UI purposes only, and no sensitive operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple user interface script that employs standard library functions without any malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
