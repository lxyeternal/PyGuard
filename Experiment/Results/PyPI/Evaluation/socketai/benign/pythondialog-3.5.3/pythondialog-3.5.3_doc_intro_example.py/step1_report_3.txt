  "purpose": "To display a menu interface using the 'dialog' library and handle user input.",
  "sources": "Reading user input through the dialog menu and button presses.",
  "sinks": "The user input determines control flow and displayed messages; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "User input from the dialog menu influences the control flow, but there are no external data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be a simple CLI menu application.",
  "analysis": "The script sets locale settings, initializes a dialog interface, presents a menu with three options, handles user input based on dialog response codes, and displays appropriate messages. No external network connections, file operations, or environment variable manipulations are present. The dialog library is used for user interaction, and the code concludes with a clean exit. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI menu application with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be intended for user interaction within a terminal environment, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
