  "purpose": "A simple CLI menu application using the 'dialog' library to display options and handle user input.",
  "sources": "User input via dialog menu choices and button presses.",
  "sinks": "Display messages based on user choices; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "User interacts with dialog menu (source), which triggers message boxes and info boxes (sinks) based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a text-based UI menu, utilizing the 'dialog' library for user interaction. It sets locale, creates a dialog object, displays a menu, and reacts to user input by showing message boxes. There are no external data fetches, network connections, or code execution beyond the UI interactions. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The control flow is simple and secure, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or handle untrusted data insecurely. The code is safe for supply chain use, and the security assessment should reflect a very low risk profile.",
