{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of pythondialog to create terminal dialog boxes including message, yes/no, and input prompts.",
  "sources": "User input from dialog widgets (msgbox, yesno, inputbox)",
  "sinks": "Display messages based on user input; no external data transmission or system modifications",
  "flows": "User input flows into message display functions; no external or untrusted data sources involved",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward UI demonstration using the pythondialog library. It initializes locale settings, creates dialog instances, and interacts with the user via terminal dialogs. There are no external network calls, file operations, or system modifications. User inputs are handled locally and displayed back. The code contains no obfuscation, malicious commands, or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign, intended behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security vulnerabilities. It functions solely as an example of terminal dialog usage.",
