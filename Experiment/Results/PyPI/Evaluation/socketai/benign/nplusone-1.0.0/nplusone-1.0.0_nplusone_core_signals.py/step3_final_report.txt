{
  "purpose": "Provides event signaling and receiver management utilities using the blinker library, enabling functions to emit signals, suppress signals temporarily, and manage signal receivers dynamically.",
  "sources": "Function calls within signalify, designalify, and ignore; signal receivers obtained via signal.receivers_for(sender).",
  "sinks": "Signal.send() method, which transmits data including function args, kwargs, return values, and context; potential for internal data leakage if signals are misused.",
  "flows": "Wrapped functions invoke the original function, then send signals with data; ignore() disconnects receivers, yields control, then reconnects them, managing signal flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard event signaling using the blinker library, with functions to emit signals, suppress them temporarily, and manage receivers. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity is present. Signal data could leak sensitive information if misused, but this is typical in event-driven systems. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common patterns. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) reflecting potential data leakage if signals are misused. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of signal management using the blinker library. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The potential data leakage risk is a general concern with event signaling but not an inherent flaw. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
