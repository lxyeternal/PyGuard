  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of signal management using the blinker library. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The potential data leakage risk is a general concern with event signaling but not an inherent flaw. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
