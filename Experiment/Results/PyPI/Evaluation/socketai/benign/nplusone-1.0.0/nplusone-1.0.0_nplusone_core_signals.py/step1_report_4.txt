{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a signaling mechanism using the blinker library to allow different parts of an application to communicate via signals. It provides functions to send signals, temporarily ignore signals, and wrap functions to automatically send signals on execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments (*args, **kwargs) and from the signals' receivers when disconnecting and connecting them.",
  "sinks": "Signals are sent with the result of functions ('ret') and contextual data, which could potentially leak information if untrusted code manipulates signal handlers or if signals are misused to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Functions wrapped with 'signalify' send signals after execution, passing along data; 'designalify' temporarily disconnects signal receivers to prevent signal handling during function execution; 'ignore' temporarily disconnects and then reconnects signal receivers.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a signal handling mechanism with no obvious malicious behavior. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the 'blinker' library to manage signals, allowing functions to notify other parts of the application when they run. 'signalify' wraps functions to send signals post-execution, potentially exposing function results or internal states if signals are misused. 'designalify' and 'ignore' manage signal receivers dynamically. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The implementation is straightforward, aimed at modular event handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard signal handling pattern for application modularity and event notification. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The primary concern is that signals could leak sensitive data if used improperly, but the code itself is benign.",
