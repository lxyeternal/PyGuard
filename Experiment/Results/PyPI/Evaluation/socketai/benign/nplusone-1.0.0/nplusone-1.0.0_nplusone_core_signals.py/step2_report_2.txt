  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward implementation of signal management using the blinker library.\n   - It defines signals, functions to send signals (`signalify`), suppress signals (`designalify`), and temporarily disconnect/reconnect signal receivers (`ignore`).\n   - The functions and signals are standard, with no obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The signal data includes function arguments, return values, and context, which could potentially leak sensitive data if misused, but this is typical for event-driven code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - They note that signals could leak internal data if used improperly, but this is a known and manageable concern in event-driven systems.\n   - No false claims or logical flaws are evident in the reports; they correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n\n3. **Scores Review & Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minor concerns about data leakage if signals are misused. This is reasonable, as the code itself is not risky but could be misused in a larger context.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on code structure and behavior.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is presented or inferred beyond standard considerations.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n   - The risk scores are slightly above zero due to potential data leakage if signals are misused, which is reasonable.\n\n6. **Overall Justification & Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign, standard implementation of event signaling.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The small security risk score is justified by the potential for internal data leakage if signals are misused, but this is not a flaw in the code itself.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, related to potential data leakage if signals are misused)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, benign signaling utility. The reports are accurate and consistent. There are no security concerns beyond standard considerations for event-driven systems.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores; they are appropriate given the analysis.",
