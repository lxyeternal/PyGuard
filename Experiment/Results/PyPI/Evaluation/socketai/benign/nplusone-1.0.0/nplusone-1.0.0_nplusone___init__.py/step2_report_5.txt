  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies.\n   - No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and does not contain any security issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple, standard version declaration.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports conclude no malicious activity, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - A higher risk score would be unjustified here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports indicate no malware.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are present.\n   - The analysis correctly interprets the code's simplicity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, static assignment of a version string, common in Python packages. It does not involve any dynamic or malicious behavior, external inputs, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the provided scores.**",
