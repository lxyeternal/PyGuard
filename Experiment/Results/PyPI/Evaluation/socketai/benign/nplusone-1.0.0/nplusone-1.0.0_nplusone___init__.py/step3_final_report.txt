  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, typically used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '1.0.0' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string, with no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or dependencies. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless version declaration with no security implications. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
