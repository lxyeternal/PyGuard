  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the variable `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external dependencies involved. The code is static and minimal.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**  \nGiven the simplicity, there is no indication of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious activity. All reports agree that this is a benign version declaration.\n\n3. **Obfuscation and Anomalies**  \nNo obfuscation or anomalies are detected in any report. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. There is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, as expected.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments**  \nSince the code is a simple static assignment, there are no grounds to increase any scores. The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \nBased on the reports, the code fragment is benign, with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The confidence level is high (1), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\nNo changes needed. The reports are accurate, and the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security implications.",
