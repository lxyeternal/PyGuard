  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nplusone' Python package, primarily used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'nplusone/__init__.py' for version, 'README.rst' for description, and 'LICENSE' for license information.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The script does not execute untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file -> Reads long description from a file -> Sets up package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard setup script. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines: reading files for version, description, and license; configuring package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external command invocation present. The use of 're' for regex matching is safe, and the functions handle file I/O securely without executing untrusted code. The package dependencies are explicitly listed, and the code does not modify or generate code at runtime beyond static reading.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for packaging purposes only.",
