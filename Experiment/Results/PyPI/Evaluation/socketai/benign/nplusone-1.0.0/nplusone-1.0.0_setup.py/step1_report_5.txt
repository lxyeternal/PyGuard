{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'nplusone' Python module, including version extraction and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading the version number from 'nplusone/__init__.py', reading the LICENSE file, and reading the README.rst file.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reading untrusted files ('LICENSE', 'README.rst', '__init__.py') from the local filesystem, which is typical for setup scripts; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Read files for version, license, and long description; pass data into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports modules, defines helper functions for reading files and extracting version info, and calls setuptools.setup() with project metadata. It reads local files ('__init__.py', 'LICENSE', 'README.rst') to populate setup parameters, which is standard practice. No external data sources or untrusted input handling present. The code does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or code execution beyond reading local files. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads local files to configure package metadata. No indicators of malware or supply chain attacks are present.",
