{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for packaging the 'nplusone' module.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'nplusone/__init__.py', reads static files 'README.rst' and 'LICENSE'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads are safe and do not lead to data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "Reads from fixed local files; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward use of regex and file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads static files for metadata and version info, then calls setuptools.setup(). It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication, or handle untrusted input. The regex used is simple and safe. All functions operate on fixed, local files. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
