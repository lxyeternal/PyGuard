  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a standard Python package setup script.\n- Reads version info from a specific file (`nplusone/__init__.py`) via regex.\n- Reads static files (`README.rst`, `LICENSE`) for description and license.\n- Uses `setuptools` to configure package metadata, dependencies, and packaging options.\n- No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or security flaws?**  \n  None. The code is well-structured, standard, and secure for its purpose.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None. The code is a standard setup script, with no evidence of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The functions for reading files are simple and do not process untrusted data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script for packaging a Python module. It reads static files, extracts version info with regex, and calls `setup()` with metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The code is safe, with no security concerns.\n- No changes needed in the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. The code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
