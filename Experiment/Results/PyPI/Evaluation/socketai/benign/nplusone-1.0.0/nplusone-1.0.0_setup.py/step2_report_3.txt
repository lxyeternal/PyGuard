  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The provided code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It reads static files ('nplusone/__init__.py', 'README.rst', 'LICENSE') to gather metadata.\n- Uses regex to extract version info from a local file.\n- No user input, network communication, dynamic code execution, or external data processing.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious constructs.\n- All operations are typical for a package setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Findings: No untrusted data flows, no suspicious code.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Reads static files, no execution of untrusted data.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Reads static files, no dynamic code or network activity.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: No untrusted data or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Reads local files for metadata, no malicious activity.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any actual issues?**  \n  No. All reports agree that this is a straightforward, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior?**  \n  None are evident. The code reads static files and extracts version info via regex, which is safe here.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?**  \n  No. The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, standard, and free of obfuscation or malware. No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
