{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nplusone' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'nplusone/__init__.py', reading long description from 'README.rst', reading license from 'LICENSE'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, reading files from the filesystem could be exploited if files are manipulated or replaced, but no direct untrusted data processing or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "File reads (version, description, license) from local filesystem; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file reading and package setup configuration. The find_version function reads a file to extract version info via regex, which is safe in this context. The read function reads file contents for description and license. All dependencies are statically declared. No user input, network activity, or code execution is present. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no anomalies. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
