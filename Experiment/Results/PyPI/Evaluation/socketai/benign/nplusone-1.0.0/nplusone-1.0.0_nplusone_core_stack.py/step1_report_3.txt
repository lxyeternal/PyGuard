{
  "purpose": "To identify and retrieve the stack frame of the caller outside specific known patterns",
  "sources": "inspect.stack() retrieves the current call stack frames",
  "sinks": "No direct sink, but the function could be used to identify call locations potentially for further processing",
  "flows": "From inspect.stack() (source) to filtering based on pattern matches to return the first matching frame",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code. The function filters call stack frames based on filename patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of patterns related to test or site-packages modules. The get_caller function inspects the current call stack, then filters and returns the first frame whose filename does not contain any of these patterns. This can be used to identify the originating caller outside certain known modules. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data leakage, or harmful activities. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility to find the caller frame outside specified patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign and used for debugging or introspection purposes.",
