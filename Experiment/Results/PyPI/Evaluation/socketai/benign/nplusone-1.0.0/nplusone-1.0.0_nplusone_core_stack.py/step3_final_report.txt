  "purpose": "Utility function to inspect the call stack and filter frames based on filename patterns, primarily for debugging or context analysis.",
  "sources": "The call stack obtained via inspect.stack()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; the function only reads the call stack frames",
  "flows": "Input: inspect.stack() -> Filtering frames based on patterns -> Returning the first matching frame",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard patterns for debugging",
  "analysis": "The code inspects the current call stack and filters out frames whose filenames contain specific patterns ('site-packages', 'py.test', 'nplusone'). It returns the first frame that does not match these patterns, which is typical for debugging or context-aware utilities. No suspicious or malicious behavior, data leaks, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The logic is correct, and the patterns used are common for excluding external or testing frames. The code is simple, clear, and does not perform any operations that could be malicious. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.0-0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero or near-zero. No further action or escalation is necessary.",
