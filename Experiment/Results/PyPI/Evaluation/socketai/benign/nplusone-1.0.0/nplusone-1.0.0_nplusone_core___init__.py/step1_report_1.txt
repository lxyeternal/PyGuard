  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided, as the code is missing from the input.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, functions parameters, and potentially from imported modules or external inputs (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system calls (not explicitly shown), which are typical points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Without explicit code, it's unclear how data flows from sources to sinks. Typically, data from inputs might reach sensitive operations like network or file handling.",
  "anomalies": "No code present to analyze, but the absence of code makes it impossible to identify anomalies. If code existed, look for hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "There is no code provided to analyze. Without source, sink, or flow details, no specific security issues can be identified. The absence of code prevents assessment of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review. Therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified or confirmed.",
