  "purpose": "A notification framework with configurable log and error notifiers, used for monitoring or alerting within an application.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings for enabling/disabling notifiers, message objects passed into notify methods.",
  "sinks": "Logging output and exception raising with message content.",
  "flows": "Configuration determines notifier activation -> notify() called with message -> message used in logs or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Direct use of message.message in logs/exceptions without sanitization; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward notification system with configurable notifiers for logging and raising exceptions. No external network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The message content is used directly, which could pose a minor risk if messages are untrusted, but this is a common pattern. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior. The security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting potential for log injection if messages are untrusted, but overall the code is benign. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign notification framework with no malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. The minor security concern regarding message content is acknowledged but does not constitute a vulnerability. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
