{
  "purpose": "This code defines notification classes for handling 'n plus one' query detection alerts, including logging and error raising mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary passed to constructors and the init() function; 'notify' method calls and config.get() calls.",
  "sinks": "Logging output in LogNotifier; raising exceptions in ErrorNotifier.",
  "flows": "Config data flows into notifier initialization; notify() methods process messages which are logged or raise errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard logging and exception handling is normal. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a notification system with two classes: LogNotifier and ErrorNotifier. Both read configuration options to determine whether they are enabled. LogNotifier logs messages; ErrorNotifier raises configured exceptions. The init() function initializes enabled notifiers based on the config. The code appears to be designed for monitoring and alerting, not malicious activity. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward and uses standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a notification framework for a specific use case (n+1 query detection alerts). There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as expected for logging and exception raising based on configuration.",
