{
  "purpose": "Define notification mechanisms for logging or raising errors related to potential issues detected by the nplusone package.",
  "sources": "Configuration input via the 'config' dictionary; specifically, config.get() calls for various keys.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data passed into the notify methods, especially message.message, which is used in logging or raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Configuration data influences the instantiation of notifiers; notify methods use message.message as output, which could be logged or raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code is straightforward, primarily defining classes for notification handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines notifier classes that log or raise errors based on configuration settings. The config is used to determine if notifiers are enabled. The notify methods operate on message objects, calling message.message for output. No untrusted input sources are directly read or fetched within this code segment; the message parameter is external and passed in during runtime. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors, is evident. The code is well-structured and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configurable notification system for logging or raising errors. It appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
