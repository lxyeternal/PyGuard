{
  "purpose": "This code provides a notification framework for reporting potential issues, likely related to detecting N+1 query problems, with pluggable notifiers (logging or raising errors).",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'config' dictionary passed during initialization and in the init() function. No other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The 'notify' methods either log messages or raise exceptions based on the message object; no data is sent over the network or to external systems.",
  "flows": "The config dict determines enabled notifiers; if enabled, the notify() method is called with a message object. LogNotifier logs messages; ErrorNotifier raises exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are present. The code appears to implement a straightforward notification pattern. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a notifier system with pluggable notifiers, controlled via configuration. The LogNotifier logs messages at a specified level; ErrorNotifier raises exceptions. The init() function initializes active notifiers based on config settings. The code does not perform any external network activity, data collection, or malicious actions. The usage of exceptions from 'nplusone.core.exceptions' appears standard, and the logging setup is conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign notification framework without any signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It functions as intended to notify about issues through logs or exceptions. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
