{
  "purpose": "This code provides notification mechanisms for monitoring purposes, specifically logging or raising exceptions for a 'n+1' query warning.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary passed to class constructors and the init() function, which determines enabled notification types.",
  "sinks": "The notify() methods, which could output logs or raise exceptions based on input messages.",
  "flows": "Configuration inputs -> is_enabled() checks -> notifier instantiation -> notify() called with message objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious API calls, or unusual code behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines notification classes for logging or raising errors based on configuration. The init() function dynamically instantiates enabled notifiers. The notify() method in LogNotifier logs messages, and in ErrorNotifier raises exceptions. The code appears straightforward and intended for monitoring. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. It solely relies on external configuration to determine behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign notification framework with no evidence of malicious intent. It manages logging and exception raising based on configuration. No security risks or malware are detected.",
