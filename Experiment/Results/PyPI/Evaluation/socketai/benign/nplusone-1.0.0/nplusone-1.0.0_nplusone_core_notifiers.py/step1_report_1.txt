  "purpose": "Define notification mechanisms (logging and error raising) for a system monitoring potential issues, configurable via a provided config.",
  "sources": "Configuration input (config dictionary), message input to notify methods.",
  "sinks": "Logging output, raising exceptions (potentially untrusted data in message).",
  "flows": "Config -> Notifier classes -> notify methods -> logging or exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of external input sources or network operations; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Message data is used directly in logging or exceptions, but these are standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for notification handling, including logging and exception raising based on configuration. The config parameters control whether notifications are enabled, and how they behave. Logging is performed with standard Python logging, and exceptions are raised with configurable error classes. The message is used directly in both logging and exception raising, which could be problematic if message contents are untrusted, but no external input or network activity is present. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code seems to serve a monitoring/alerting purpose without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement configurable notification mechanisms without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation, and there are no signs of supply chain threats. The use of messages directly in logs or exceptions is standard, but if messages originate from untrusted sources, it could pose a minor risk. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
