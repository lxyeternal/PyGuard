{
  "purpose": "A profiling utility that manages listeners to detect and raise exceptions on specific message patterns, likely used for monitoring database query issues such as N+1 problems.",
  "sources": "The 'notify' method reads messages that are passed to it; the 'whitelist' is set during initialization; external modules ('listeners', 'exceptions') are imported but not directly sources of untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "The 'notify' method raises an exception ('NPlusOneError') when a message does not match the whitelist, which acts as a control flow rather than a data sink; no external data is exfiltrated or written to disk/network.",
  "flows": "Messages are received by 'notify', checked against 'whitelist'; if not matched, an exception is raised, terminating or signaling an issue; setup and teardown manage listeners but do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a context manager that initializes listeners, monitors messages, and raises exceptions if messages do not match a whitelist. It relies on external modules for listener behavior and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The exception-raising mechanism is a typical pattern in profiling tools to flag issues. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or contain hidden malicious payloads. The use of 'six' ensures compatibility but does not introduce security concerns. Overall, the code appears to be a benign monitoring utility with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign profiling utility designed to detect specific patterns and raise exceptions accordingly. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score of 0 and low risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
