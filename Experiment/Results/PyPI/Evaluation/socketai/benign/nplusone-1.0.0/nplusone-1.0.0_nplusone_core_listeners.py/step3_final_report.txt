{
  "purpose": "The code implements signal-based ORM query monitoring to detect n+1 queries and unnecessary eager loads, providing notifications for potential performance issues.",
  "sources": "Signals such as load, ignore_load, eager_load, touch, and lazy_load; parser functions supplied during signal handling.",
  "sinks": "Calls to self.parent.notify() with message objects indicating detected issues.",
  "flows": "Signals trigger handlers which parse arguments, update internal state, and generate messages; messages are sent via notify() to alert about potential ORM inefficiencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external system interactions are present; code is straightforward and purpose-driven.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python patterns for signal handling and data tracking related to ORM query optimization. It tracks loaded, ignored, and touched instances, then reports potential n+1 or unnecessary eager load issues. No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The signal connections and data structures are appropriate for its debugging purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, performance-monitoring intent of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ORM query monitoring utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are accurate and justified, reflecting its low security risk and straightforward purpose.",
