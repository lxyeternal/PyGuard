  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the consistency of their conclusions and scores.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal class definition for a custom exception (`NPlusOneError`) with no input/output, data flow, or external interactions.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in any of the reports.\n   - All reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence of 1.0, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is just a class definition with no suspicious features, there is no reason to increase the scores.\n\n5. **Any Claims Based on Assumptions?**\n   - All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions, correctly stating the benign nature.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content:**\n   - Scores are consistent across all reports, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple, benign class definition for a custom exception. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0                     |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
