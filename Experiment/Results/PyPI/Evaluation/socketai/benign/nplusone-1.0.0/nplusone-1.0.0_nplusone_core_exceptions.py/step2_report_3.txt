  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition with no input/output, data flow, or external interactions. There are no issues present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security concerns. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0  \nThese scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree the code is harmless, no higher risk scores are justified. The risk scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis**  \nAll reports assign malware: 0, which is correct. The code shows no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions; they simply state the code's minimal and benign nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
