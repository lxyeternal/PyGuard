  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception, with no input/output, data flow, or external interactions.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no external interactions, data processing, or malicious constructs, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions, sticking to observable facts.\n   - No unwarranted claims or speculative vulnerabilities are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - The uniformity across reports reflects a shared understanding of the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risk associated with this code)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the reports are accurate and well-founded.**",
