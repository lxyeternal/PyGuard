  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; simple class definition with no complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition of a custom exception inheriting from Exception, with no additional methods, data, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to serve as a utility for exception handling within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for custom exception classes, and shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
