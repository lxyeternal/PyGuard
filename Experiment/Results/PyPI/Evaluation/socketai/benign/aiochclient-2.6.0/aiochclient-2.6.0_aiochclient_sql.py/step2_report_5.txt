  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The report concludes no malicious activity, just a configuration of sqlparse with custom regex and keywords.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, static configuration. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, appropriate scoring.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on static configuration, no external data flow, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (a slight risk, possibly due to configuration changes), obfuscated=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score, but still consistent with benign configuration.  \n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above—static configuration, no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard parser customization, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—legitimate parser extension, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports identify the code as a benign configuration of the sqlparse library.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The code solely modifies regex patterns and keywords for SQL parsing, which is a common and legitimate activity.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate and safe customization of an open-source SQL parsing library.**",
