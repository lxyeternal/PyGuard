  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports standard and third-party modules related to SQL parsing.\n- Defines a custom `Where` class extending sqlparse's `TokenList` with specific open/close tokens.\n- Retrieves the default `Lexer` instance, clears its existing rules.\n- Sets regex patterns for specific SQL keywords (`FORMAT`, `DESCRIBE`, `SHOW`, `EXISTS`).\n- Adds these keywords to the lexer with associated token types.\n- Overall, this code is for customizing the behavior of the sqlparse library to recognize additional SQL syntax elements.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Configure/extend sqlparse for better parsing.  \n- Findings: No suspicious behavior, malicious activity, or obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate, purely functional setup.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar extension of sqlparse, defining custom tokens and regex rules.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no external data, no obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate configuration.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.1 (very low, possibly due to the nature of parsing code, but no actual risk evident)\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, adding custom keywords and tokens.  \n- Findings: Static configuration, no external input, no malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, safe customization.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Extending sqlparse with regex and keywords.  \n- Findings: No suspicious activity, no data flow from untrusted sources, no obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Standard parser setup, safe.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar configuration of sqlparse.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate customization.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity?**  \n  All reports and the code itself show only static configuration of a SQL parser library. No code injection, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no external inputs processed.\n\n- **Are the modifications suspicious?**  \n  No. They are typical for extending a parser to recognize additional keywords and syntax elements.\n\n- **Is there any malware?**  \n  No evidence of malware. The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Are the risk scores reasonable?**  \n  The scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1 for security risk, which is acceptable given the context. No report suggests a significant security concern.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis. No report assigns a high risk or malware score.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — The code is purely for customizing a parser library, with no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risk is evident from the code.\n\n**Estimated scores after review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code and the reports collectively indicate a benign, legitimate configuration of the sqlparse library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.**",
