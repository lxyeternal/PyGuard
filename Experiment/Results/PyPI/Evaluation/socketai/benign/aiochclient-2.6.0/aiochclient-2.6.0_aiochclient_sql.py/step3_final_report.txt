{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the sqlparse library by defining a custom 'Where' class, clearing and reconfiguring the lexer, setting regex patterns for specific SQL keywords, and adding keywords to improve parsing capabilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads static definitions from imported modules, sets regex patterns, and adds keywords to the lexer; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code only modifies parser configuration.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves setting regex patterns and adding keywords to the lexer, which are static operations without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom token class, clears existing lexer rules, sets regex patterns for specific SQL keywords, and adds these keywords to the lexer. All operations are static configuration steps aimed at extending the parser's recognition capabilities. There is no data processing from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The code's purpose is purely to enhance SQL parsing functionality. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, legitimate extension of the sqlparse library, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
