  "purpose": "Configure and extend the sqlparse library to recognize specific SQL syntax elements and keywords for improved parsing.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries (re, sqlparse.keywords, sqlparse.tokens, sqlparse.lexer, sqlparse.sql). Modifications to the Lexer instance, including setting regex patterns and adding keywords.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs observed. No external data handling or network communication present.",
  "flows": "The code sets up regex patterns and keywords in the Lexer, which influences how SQL queries are tokenized during parsing. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present. The code appears solely to customize the sqlparse lexer behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and extends sqlparse's token handling by defining a custom 'Where' class with specific open and close tokens. It then retrieves the default Lexer instance, clears its existing rules, and redefines SQL regex patterns for certain keywords, including 'FORMAT', 'DESCRIBE', 'SHOW', and 'EXISTS'. Additional keywords are added to the Lexer, including 'FORMAT', 'EXISTS', 'DESCRIBE', and 'SHOW'. These modifications improve the parser's ability to recognize various SQL statements. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's purpose appears to be purely functional customization for SQL parsing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for customizing the sqlparse lexer to recognize specific SQL syntax and keywords. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration script for SQL parsing purposes.",
