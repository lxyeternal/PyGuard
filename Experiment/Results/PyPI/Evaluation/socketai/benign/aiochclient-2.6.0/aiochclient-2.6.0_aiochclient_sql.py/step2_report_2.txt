  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code customizes sqlparse by defining a custom 'Where' class, clearing the lexer, setting regex patterns, and adding keywords.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no malicious logic, purely configuration.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both set to 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the extension of sqlparse with custom tokens and regex, with no external data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.1 (slightly above zero but justified as minimal configuration change).\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity, just parser extension.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on static configuration, adding regex patterns and keywords.\n- **Findings:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—extending sqlparse with regex and keywords, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no dynamic code, no external data flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the static configuration approach, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely about configuring the sqlparse library—adding regex patterns, defining custom token classes, and registering keywords. There is no evidence of code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently zero across all reports, which is appropriate given the static configuration nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Zero or near-zero, since no security vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard extension of an open-source SQL parsing library, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, purely for customizing SQL parsing, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
