  "purpose": "Configure and extend the sqlparse library to customize SQL tokenization, keyword recognition, and regex patterns for parsing SQL statements.",
  "sources": "SQLPARSE_LEXER.set_SQL_REGEX, SQLPARSE_LEXER.add_keywords",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data being written or transmitted, no untrusted data flows are evident",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly modifies parser configuration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the default SQL parser lexer instance by clearing it, then setting regex patterns for SQL keywords and operators. It extends keyword recognition with common SQL keywords and adds specific patterns for FORMAT, DESCRIBE, SHOW, EXISTS, and other keywords. These are standard customization steps for the sqlparse library, without any signs of malicious activity. The code does not process or handle untrusted input directly, nor does it perform network activity or data exfiltration. No indicators of backdoors or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code safely customizes the sqlparse SQL parser configuration without introducing security risks or malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a legitimate SQL parsing extension or configuration setup.",
