{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the sqlparse library to modify its token handling and regex matching for SQL parsing, specifically adding custom keywords and token classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as SQL keywords, regex patterns, and token class definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the code primarily configures parser behavior with static data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves setting regex patterns and adding keywords to the lexer, which are static configurations without user input or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code only modifies parser configurations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sqlparse library and extends its classes and lexer settings, adding custom token types and regex patterns for specific SQL keywords. All modifications are based on static definitions, with no external inputs or dynamic code execution involved. The purpose appears to be enhancing or customizing SQL parsing capabilities, not malicious activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward configuration of an open-source library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign customization of the sqlparse library for specific SQL syntax handling. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks. The modifications are static and do not involve external data or execution flows that could be exploited.",
