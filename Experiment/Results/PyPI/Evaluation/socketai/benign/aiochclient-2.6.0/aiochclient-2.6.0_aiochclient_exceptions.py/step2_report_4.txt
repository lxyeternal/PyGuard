  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`ChClientError`) inheriting from Python's `Exception`. The class has a descriptive docstring outlining scenarios where it might be raised, such as unrecognized data types, invalid arguments, or errors from Clickhouse.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**  \n   - The code does not read external data, process inputs, or perform any runtime logic.\n   - No data sinks, data flows, or network operations are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n   - The class is purely a structural component for error handling.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**  \n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for defining custom exceptions.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), indicating that the analysis is certain about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified; no security risks are present.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**  \n   - The reports assume that this snippet is part of a larger codebase. If the larger codebase were malicious, that would be outside the scope of this snippet.\n   - The class itself does not introduce vulnerabilities; it's a standard exception class.\n\n6. **Conclusion & Recommendations**  \n   - The code is benign and aligns with best practices for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary based on the evidence.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' assessments.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet does not pose any security threat. It is a standard, well-documented custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious features.",
