  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific errors related to Clickhouse client operations.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways as the code only defines an exception class without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a descriptive docstring explaining potential error scenarios. There are no external data sources, sinks, or complex flows. The code appears to be part of a larger module handling Clickhouse interactions, but in this snippet, it is purely a class definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition for a custom exception, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
