{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'ChClientError' for handling specific Clickhouse-related errors such as unrecognized data types, invalid arguments, or errors returned by Clickhouse.",
  "sources": "The class itself does not read input or data; it is a definition for error handling used elsewhere in the codebase.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths in this isolated class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class with a descriptive docstring, no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class with a clear purpose. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reviews confirm its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented custom exception class intended for error handling in a larger system. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern signals present.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
