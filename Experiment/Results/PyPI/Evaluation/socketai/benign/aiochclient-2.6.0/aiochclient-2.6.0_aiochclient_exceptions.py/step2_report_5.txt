  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code defines a single custom exception class `ChClientError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The class includes a descriptive docstring outlining scenarios where it might be raised:\n     - Unrecognized data types from user or Clickhouse.\n     - Passing arguments to non-insert queries.\n     - Errors returned by Clickhouse.\n   - The code is purely a class definition with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, or flows that could be exploited.\n   - The class is a standard pattern for error handling in Python.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, as there are no security concerns in this snippet.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The report purpose emphasizes defining a custom exception class, which is a common and safe practice.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are justified or implied.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the class is intended for error handling, its presence alone does not introduce risk.\n   - The docstring clarifies the intended use, which is good practice.\n\n**Conclusion & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Overall**, the code snippet is a benign, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code content.",
