  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the security implications.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a simple class definition for a custom exception, inheriting from `Exception`, with a descriptive docstring. There are no data sources, sinks, or logic that could be exploited. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that this is a benign, straightforward class definition. They note the absence of data flow, input/output, or suspicious constructs. No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports agree that the code is benign, and there is no evidence of malicious intent, the risk score should remain at 0. The malware score is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply describe the code as a benign exception class.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no risks, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\nGiven the simplicity of this code snippet, there is no reason to assign any higher scores. It appears to be a standard, well-documented custom exception class intended for error handling in a larger codebase related to Clickhouse.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scoring:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0",
