  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific errors related to Clickhouse interactions.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as no input handling or processing is implemented.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, only defining an exception class with a descriptive docstring. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'ChClientError' inheriting from Exception, with a descriptive docstring outlining possible error conditions it represents. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic that could be exploited. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are visible. The code is simple, intended for error handling, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It serves to represent specific error conditions in a larger application context.",
