{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for handling database query result rows, including efficient memory usage and JSON deserialization.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from bytes objects (e.g., row bytes, names bytes, JSON bytes).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data into system effects; data is primarily read-only or parsed.",
  "flows": "Input bytes are decoded into structured data, then accessed via index or key. No untrusted data is written or sent over network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of try-except for optional import is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements data structures for handling database query results with lazy decoding, supports JSON deserialization, and manages conversions via provided functions. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The optional import is safe fallback. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. The overall code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for data handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or dangerous behaviors.",
