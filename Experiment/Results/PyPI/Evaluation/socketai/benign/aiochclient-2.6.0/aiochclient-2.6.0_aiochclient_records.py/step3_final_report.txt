  "purpose": "Provides classes for handling database query results and JSON deserialization in a memory-efficient manner.",
  "sources": "The 'row' bytes in Record and new row bytes in RecordsFabric; the external 'loads' function in FromJsonFabric.",
  "sinks": "The 'loads' function in FromJsonFabric, which could execute arbitrary code if untrusted.",
  "flows": "Bytes read from database or external source → deserialized via converters or 'loads' → data accessed via Record or returned by 'new' methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external 'loads' function in FromJsonFabric; no other suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, handling data rows efficiently with optional deserialization. The primary security concern is the external 'loads' function, which could execute malicious code if untrusted. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard patterns and is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws beyond the typical deserialization risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and standard for its purpose. The main risk is the external 'loads' function in FromJsonFabric, which should be used with trusted inputs. No malware or obfuscation detected; overall security risk is minimal.",
