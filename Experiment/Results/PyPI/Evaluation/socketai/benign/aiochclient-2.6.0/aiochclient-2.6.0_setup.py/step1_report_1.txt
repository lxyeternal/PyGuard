  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the aiochclient Python package with optional C extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads files (README.md), imports build and packaging modules, and defines package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data output; uses standard setup and build procedures.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> Configures build extensions -> Attempts to compile C extensions -> Falls back to pure Python if compilation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Use of try-except to fallback from C extension compilation is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package setup, including optional compilation of C extensions via Cython. It attempts to build extensions with error handling that falls back to a pure Python implementation if compilation fails. The use of standard libraries and well-known tools like setuptools and distutils indicates typical package build logic. No suspicious input sources or malicious sinks are detected. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data leaks. The exception handling for build failures is benign and intended to ensure robustness.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with optional C extensions, containing no malicious behavior or security issues. It appropriately handles build failures without exposing sensitive data or executing malicious actions.",
