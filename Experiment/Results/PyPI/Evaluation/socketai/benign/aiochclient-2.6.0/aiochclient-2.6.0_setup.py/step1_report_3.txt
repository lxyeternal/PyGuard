  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the aiochclient Python package with optional Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing modules, handling build exceptions, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks found; potential build failure handling is benign. No data leaks or malicious outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> define extensions -> attempt Cython compilation -> handle build failure -> execute setup -> fallback on failure.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for optional Cython compilation, fallback to pure Python; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code flows. No obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary build modules, sets up optional Cython compilation, and handles build failures gracefully. The setup configuration defines package info, dependencies, and optional requirements. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors are detected. The code's structure follows standard Python packaging practices, with appropriate exception handling for build issues. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with safe handling of optional Cython compilation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
