  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'aiochclient' Python package, including optional Cython extension compilation with fallback on failure, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package configuration data, and handling C extension modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: reading files and configuration data; Sink: package installation process; Flow: configuration data used to build and install the package.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard practices for Python package setup, with conditional Cython compilation and error handling to fallback gracefully. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The exception handling for build failures is typical. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The security and malware scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. It employs standard patterns for optional C extension compilation with fallback, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
