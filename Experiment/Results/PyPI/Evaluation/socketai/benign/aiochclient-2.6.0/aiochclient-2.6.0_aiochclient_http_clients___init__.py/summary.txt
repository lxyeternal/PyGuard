  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign with low security risk, while Report 5 exhibits significant suspicious features justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Scores are internally consistent and justified by the evidence. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate risk, with one notable high-risk case."
