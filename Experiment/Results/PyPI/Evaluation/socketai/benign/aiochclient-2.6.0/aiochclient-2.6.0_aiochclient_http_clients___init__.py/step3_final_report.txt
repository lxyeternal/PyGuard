  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, files, network data, and dynamic execution points such as eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from untrusted sources (e.g., network, environment) through dynamic execution or data handling to sinks like network or filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or unusual data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, appropriate scores, and high confidence in benignity. Report 5 shows dynamic execution, obfuscation, and suspicious data flow, justifying high malware (0.7), obfuscated (0.8), and security risk (0.8) scores. Confidence levels are consistent with the evidence. The low-confidence reports are cautious and align with their low scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the described features, with Report 5 justifiably raising concern.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign with low security risk, while Report 5 exhibits significant suspicious features justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Scores are internally consistent and justified by the evidence. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate risk, with one notable high-risk case.",
