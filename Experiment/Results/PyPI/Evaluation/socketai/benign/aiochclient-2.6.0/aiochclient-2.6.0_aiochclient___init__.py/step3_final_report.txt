{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and exceptions from the aiochclient library and defines an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from aiochclient (aiochclient.client, aiochclient.exceptions, aiochclient.records)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "Static import statements without data flow or external input processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that re-exports classes and exceptions from a third-party library. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or user input handling. Static analysis shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import statements are straightforward, and the __all__ list is standard for module exports. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified as zero, with high confidence due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions solely as a structural module for re-exporting symbols from aiochclient. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
