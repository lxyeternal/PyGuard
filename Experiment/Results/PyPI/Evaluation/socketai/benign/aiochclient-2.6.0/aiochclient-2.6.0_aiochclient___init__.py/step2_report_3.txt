  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import/export module, importing specific classes and exceptions from the aiochclient library.\n- No data flows, input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and benign in nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports identify any malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, the risk scores are appropriately low (0 or very close to 0).\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n- Since the code is purely import/export declarations with no processing or data handling, the potential for malware or security issues is negligible.\n- The consistent scoring across reports seems reasonable and justified.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all claims are based on static analysis.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign and does not pose security risks.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
