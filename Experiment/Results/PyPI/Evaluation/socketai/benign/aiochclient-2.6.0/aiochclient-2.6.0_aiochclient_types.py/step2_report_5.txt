  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides type conversion and parsing utilities for handling various data types from ClickHouse, with no external data sources or suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard parsing and serialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. Overall assessment aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The score seems reasonable; the code is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data parsing and conversion with no external malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malicious logic, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Regex parsing and type handling are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. The security risk is slightly above zero, possibly due to the heavy regex parsing, but no actual malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated security risk score is acceptable given the parsing complexity but does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data type handling for database interactions, with no external or malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no network or system commands, standard data processing routines.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. Very low, fitting the description.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores align well with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data type conversions, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Functions are standard for data serialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data conversion for database interaction, no malicious code or external threats.\n- **Findings:** No network or file operations, no suspicious imports or behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2. Slightly elevated but justifiable due to regex parsing complexity.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard utility for data type parsing and conversion related to ClickHouse.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- Slightly elevated security risk scores (around 0.1–0.2) are justified due to complex regex parsing but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The existing scores are justified and reasonable.",
