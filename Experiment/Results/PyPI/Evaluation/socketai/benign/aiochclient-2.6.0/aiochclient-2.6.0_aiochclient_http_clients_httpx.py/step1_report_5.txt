{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous HTTP client wrapper around httpx for making GET and POST requests, processing streamed responses, and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as URL, params, headers, and data arguments for HTTP requests, and reads response bodies via resp.aiter_bytes() and resp.aread().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the response body reading functions (_read_error_body, resp.aiter_bytes(), resp.aread()), which handle untrusted data; also, the constructor allows external session injection, which could be manipulated.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (URL, headers, params, data) flows into HTTP request methods; response data from resp.aiter_bytes() and resp.aread() flows into processing functions, which then raise errors or yield data.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious function calls. The only assertion 'assert not buffer' could be used to crash the program if response chunks are malformed but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an HTTP client using httpx, with proper response checking and streaming response handling. It does not contain any obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are detected. The response error handling reads and decodes response bodies safely. The constructor allows injection of external sessions, which could be misused if the session itself is malicious, but this is standard dependency injection and not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client wrapper with no evident malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern is reliance on external sessions, but that is typical for dependency injection and not malicious.",
