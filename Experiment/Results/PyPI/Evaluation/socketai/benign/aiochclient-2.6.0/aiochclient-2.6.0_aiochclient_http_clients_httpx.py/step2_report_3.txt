  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations from the code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward async HTTP client using httpx.\n- It performs GET and POST requests, handles streaming responses, and manages response errors.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- Error handling involves reading and decoding response bodies, which is standard.\n- The injection of an external session object is a common pattern for dependency injection, not malicious.\n- No code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration behaviors are evident.\n- The code is benign, functional, and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code being benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Low, mostly due to standard error handling and response processing.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Standard async HTTP client, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the low risk score reflects that. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar, standard async HTTP client.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is justified, reflecting low security risk.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, standard error handling and resource management.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard implementation of an async HTTP client with proper error handling and no malicious or suspicious features. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
