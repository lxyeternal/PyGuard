  "purpose": "A standard asynchronous HTTP client wrapper for making GET and POST requests with response validation and streaming support.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for URL, params, headers, and data; response body reading in error handling.",
  "sinks": "Decoding of error response bodies, which could potentially leak sensitive info if errors contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in HTTP requests; responses are checked for status; error bodies are read and decoded; streaming chunks are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of external session injection is standard dependency injection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an async HTTP client using httpx, with proper error handling, streaming, and session management. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. Error body decoding could leak sensitive info but is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured async HTTP client with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
