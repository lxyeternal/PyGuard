{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous HTTP client wrapper around httpx for making GET and POST requests, with response validation and stream handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (url, params, headers, data), and from response body via resp.aiter_bytes() and resp.aread().",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include response handling and data processing, but there are no dangerous sinks like executing untrusted code, writing to files, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into HTTP request calls, responses are checked via _check_response, and response bodies are processed and returned or used to raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. No suspicious network behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code properly manages session lifecycle, performs response status checks, and handles streaming data efficiently. It avoids dangerous practices like executing untrusted code. The only noteworthy aspect is the response status check and error reading, which are standard. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured HTTP client implementation with no malicious behavior. It is unlikely to contain malware or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
