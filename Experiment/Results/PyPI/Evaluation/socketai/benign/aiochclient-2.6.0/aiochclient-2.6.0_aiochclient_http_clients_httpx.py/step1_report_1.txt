  "purpose": "Implement an asynchronous HTTP client using httpx for making GET and POST requests, processing streaming responses, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL, params, headers, and request content provided to get and post methods.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows from response body processing in _read_error_body, especially when decoding response content after errors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTTP responses into buffer and lines in post_return_lines; error response body is read and decoded in _read_error_body.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an async HTTP client using httpx. It handles response streams, errors, and resource cleanup properly. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hidden network communications, or backdoors. The response decoding on error could leak information if error bodies contain sensitive data, but this is typical error handling behavior. No external or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of an HTTP client with appropriate error handling. No malicious or sabotage behavior identified. It is safe based on the provided code.",
