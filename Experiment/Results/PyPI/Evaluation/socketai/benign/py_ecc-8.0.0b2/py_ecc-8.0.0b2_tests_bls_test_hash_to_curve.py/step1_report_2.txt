{
  "purpose": "The code is for testing cryptographic hash-to-curve functions for BLS12-381 G1 and G2 groups, ensuring their correctness and on-curve validation.",
  "sources": "Inputs come from test vectors, hardcoded byte strings, and message inputs for hash functions.",
  "sinks": "Hash functions (`hash_to_G1`, `hash_to_G2`) and assertions check for correct point calculation and on-curve verification.",
  "flows": "Message inputs are hashed via `hash_to_G1` and `hash_to_G2`, then results are validated against expected points. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations beyond test vectors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code contains only test functions, cryptographic operations, and assertions. No network activity, system modifications, or external data access present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs parameterized tests for hash-to-curve functions, validating that the points computed are on the curve and match expected test vectors. Usage of cryptographic hash functions and elliptic curve operations are standard for cryptographic testing. No suspicious or malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets beyond test vectors, and no obfuscated code. The code is purely for validation purposes with no malicious intent or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite validating cryptographic hash-to-curve implementations. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is standard test code with no signs of sabotage or malicious payloads.",
