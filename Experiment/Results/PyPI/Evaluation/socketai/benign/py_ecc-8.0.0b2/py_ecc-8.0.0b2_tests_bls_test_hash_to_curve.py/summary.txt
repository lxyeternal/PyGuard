  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic test suite for hash-to-curve functions, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with its purpose. The minimal risk score of 0.1 is justified by the presence of hardcoded test vectors but does not represent an actual security concern."
