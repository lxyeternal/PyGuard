  "purpose": "Cryptographic routines for signing, key recovery, and verification using static test data, primarily for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded private key, test message hashes, and signature components within the code.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; all operations are internal cryptographic computations.",
  "flows": "Uses the private key to sign messages, then recovers public keys from signatures, following internal data flow without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded private key and test vectors; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations with static data, typical for testing. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The private key is hardcoded, which is a security concern outside testing environments but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is around 0.2, reflecting the private key exposure in a test context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cryptographic test suite with no malicious activity. The primary security concern is the hardcoded private key, which should be avoided in production. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
