{
  "purpose": "This script creates a virtual environment, finds a wheel file in the 'dist' directory, installs it into the virtual environment, and prompts the user to verify the installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory to locate wheel files; reads user input to proceed after testing.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess to run pip commands within the virtual environment; displays information to the user.",
  "flows": "User input triggers the script; find_wheel reads the directory; install_wheel executes pip install; test_install_local_wheel runs these steps sequentially.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious command parameters; standard use of subprocess for pip commands; reliance on user input for continuation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup, package installation, and user interaction in a straightforward manner. It uses subprocess to invoke pip for installing packages, which is typical and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The find_wheel function expects exactly one wheel file, which could potentially be manipulated if the directory contents are altered maliciously, but this is not suspicious per se. The overall flow involves creating a venv, locating a wheel, installing it, and prompting the user; no suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign testing utility for installing a local wheel into a virtual environment. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of subprocess for pip commands is standard for such operations. The overall security risk is low.",
