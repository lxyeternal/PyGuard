{
  "purpose": "The script creates a virtual environment, finds a wheel file in the 'dist' directory, installs it into the virtual environment, and prompts the user to confirm completion. It appears to be a testing utility for package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory for wheel files (Path('.')), reads user input via 'input()'.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to execute pip commands within the virtual environment; relies on user input for continuation.",
  "flows": "find_wheel() reads from filesystem, install_wheel() runs subprocess, test_install_local_wheel() calls both and waits for user input.",
  "anomalies": "None evident; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated constructs. User input is used to pause the script, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically creates a virtual environment, updates pip and setuptools, locates a wheel file, installs it, and prompts the user to confirm completion. All filesystem access appears legitimate, targeting the local directory. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. subprocess calls are standard for package management tasks. The use of 'input()' for pausing does not pose a security risk. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a package installation testing utility without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs expected filesystem and subprocess operations safely within the scope of local testing.",
