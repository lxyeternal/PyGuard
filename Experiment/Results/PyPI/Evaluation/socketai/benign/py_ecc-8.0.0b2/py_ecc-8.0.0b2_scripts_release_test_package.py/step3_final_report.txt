{
  "purpose": "Create a virtual environment, update pip and setuptools, locate a wheel file in 'dist', install it into the environment, and prompt user confirmation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem access to locate wheel files; subprocess calls to run pip commands; user input for confirmation.",
  "sinks": "pip install command execution, which can run arbitrary code if the wheel is malicious.",
  "flows": "Filesystem glob to find wheel -> subprocess run to install wheel -> user input to pause.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward subprocess calls; no validation of wheel integrity.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a virtual environment, updates pip/setuptools, finds a wheel in 'dist', installs it via subprocess, and prompts the user. It uses standard library functions and subprocess calls without obfuscation or secrets. The main security concern is the installation of an unverified wheel, which could contain malicious code that executes during pip install. The code itself is benign, but the act of installing untrusted packages poses a risk. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for local testing of package installation in a virtual environment. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security risk is the potential execution of malicious code if the wheel file is compromised, which is a known risk but not inherent to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) is appropriate due to trust assumptions about the wheel file.",
