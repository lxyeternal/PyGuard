  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for local testing of package installation in a virtual environment. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security risk is the potential execution of malicious code if the wheel file is compromised, which is a known risk but not inherent to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) is appropriate due to trust assumptions about the wheel file."
