  "purpose": "Unit tests for elliptic curve operations and cryptographic encoding/decoding in the py_ecc library.",
  "sources": "Internal function calls, fixed byte strings for error testing, elliptic curve point multiplications.",
  "sinks": "Assertions within the test functions; no external data transmission or leaks.",
  "flows": "Generation of elliptic curve points -> encoding -> decoding -> normalization and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded data for testing failure modes; no suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward cryptographic unit tests verifying encoding, decoding, and error handling for elliptic curve points. No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The tests use fixed inputs and standard library functions, with no obfuscation or suspicious code. The only notable aspect is testing failure cases with hardcoded data, which is typical in such tests and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing cryptographic primitives. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
