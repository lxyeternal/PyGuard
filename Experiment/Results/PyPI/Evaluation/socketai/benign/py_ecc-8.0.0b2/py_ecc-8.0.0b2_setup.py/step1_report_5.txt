{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'py-ecc' with specified dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, and gathers package information and dependencies from hardcoded variables and function calls.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits data to external sources or untrusted locations.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> supplies package metadata and dependencies to setup() -> package installation or build process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious string manipulations. External dependencies are standard for packaging and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines dependency groups, reads the project README for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and package configuration. No suspicious patterns, hidden behaviors, or malicious code are detected. The code aligns with typical Python packaging scripts and does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It merely automates package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
