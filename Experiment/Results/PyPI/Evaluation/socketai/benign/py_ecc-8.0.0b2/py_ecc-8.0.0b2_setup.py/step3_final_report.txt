{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'py-ecc' Python library, defining dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; defines dependencies and package metadata; uses find_packages() to locate packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network calls, dynamic code execution, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Static reading of README.md; dependency declarations; package discovery; no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup.py script with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for Python packaging, with static reads and dependency declarations. No dynamic or untrusted input processing is present. The code structure and dependencies are standard and relevant. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious logic. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating no security risks or malware present.",
