{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'py-ecc', including dependencies, package data, metadata, and distribution settings.",
  "sources": "File read operation for README.md; static definitions of dependencies, package info, and metadata; find_packages function to identify packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or inputs; all data appears hardcoded or sourced from files only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; setup configuration is static, with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; standard use of setup tools and package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, reading the README for long description, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. There are no runtime input handlers, network operations, or code execution based on external input. All dependencies are version-restricted and are standard for package development. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions solely to package and distribute the 'py-ecc' library, with no suspicious logic or potential attack vectors.",
