No external inputs other than the static README.md file are read. No untrusted data flows or suspicious code logic are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is used. The script strictly adheres to conventional packaging practices, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script for the py-ecc package. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It follows standard packaging conventions and reads only a static README.md file for metadata. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
