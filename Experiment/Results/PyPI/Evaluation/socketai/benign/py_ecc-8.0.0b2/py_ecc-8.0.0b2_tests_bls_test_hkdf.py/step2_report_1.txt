  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of parameterized unit tests for cryptographic functions `hkdf_extract` and `hkdf_expand`.\n- Test vectors are from RFC 5869, a standard for HKDF.\n- Inputs are hardcoded hex strings, converted to bytes.\n- No external or untrusted input, no network or file I/O.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns.\n- The purpose is purely validation of cryptographic correctness.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n- Confidence is high (1), and the analysis concludes benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Are the test vectors correct?**  \n   Yes, the vectors match RFC 5869 test vectors, which are standard and well-known.\n\n2. **Are the functions called appropriately?**  \n   Yes, inputs are converted from hex to bytes and passed into the functions, then compared against expected outputs.\n\n3. **Is there any malicious or suspicious behavior?**  \n   No. The code is standard test code for cryptographic validation.\n\n4. **Are there any hidden or obfuscated behaviors?**  \n   No. The code is straightforward.\n\n5. **Is there any dynamic or untrusted data handling?**  \n   No. All data is static and hardcoded.\n\n6. **Are there any side effects or data leaks?**  \n   No.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not perform any malicious activity, no code injection, no backdoors, no data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear, straightforward test code.\n- **Security risk score:** 0. The code is only testing cryptographic functions with known vectors, no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are present.\n\n### Any adjustments needed?\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and purely for validation.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard test suite verifying cryptographic functions against RFC vectors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes needed. The code poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the actual code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that test code remains isolated and does not inadvertently leak secrets or execute untrusted code in production environments. But in this case, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
