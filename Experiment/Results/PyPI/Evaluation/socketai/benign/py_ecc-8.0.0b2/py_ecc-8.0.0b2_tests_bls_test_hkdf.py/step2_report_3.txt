  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward test suite verifying cryptographic HKDF functions against RFC 5869 vectors. No suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no malicious intent.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** The code only runs tests with known, static test vectors. No dynamic input, no external data, no side effects.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound, and the code is standard test code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, verifying HKDF functions with standard vectors. No suspicious activity.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No issues. The code is a typical cryptographic test suite.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—unit tests for HKDF correctness with RFC vectors. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No issues. The code is static, well-structured, and for testing.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1. Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, test code for HKDF functions, verifying against RFC vectors. No suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No issues.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous—unit tests for cryptographic functions with standard vectors. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No issues.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1. Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe identical or very similar test suites verifying cryptographic functions against RFC test vectors. The code is static, deterministic, and intended solely for correctness validation.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Given the code's benign purpose and static data, a security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Confidence:** All reports show high confidence (1), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-understood cryptographic test suite.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data processing.\n- No network activity, no secrets beyond test vectors.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code and reports are consistent, accurate, and reflect a standard cryptographic test suite.",
