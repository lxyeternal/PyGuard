{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for cryptographic HKDF functions based on RFC 5869 standards, verifying correctness of hkdf_extract and hkdf_expand implementations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the hex string parameters in the test cases, representing salts, input keys, info strings, and expected output key material.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; tests compare function outputs to known correct values without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into cryptographic functions, and results are compared against expected outputs; no data flows into insecure or dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward test code for cryptographic functions, with no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptographic functions from a reputable library and performs standard parameterized tests based on RFC 5869 test vectors. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The test code solely verifies correctness of the cryptographic functions with known good vectors, with no network activity, data leaks, or privilege escalation mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite verifying HKDF implementation correctness. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It simply validates cryptographic functions against standard vectors.",
