  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying cryptographic HKDF functions against RFC 5869 test vectors.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded hex strings representing test vectors, converted to bytes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external I/O, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Hex strings are converted to bytes and passed into cryptographic functions; results are compared to expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static test code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of parameterized tests for hkdf_extract and hkdf_expand functions, using well-known RFC test vectors. Inputs are static, and outputs are verified against expected values. No dynamic input, no external data, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The purpose is solely validation of cryptographic correctness. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or insecure operations. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and security posture. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
