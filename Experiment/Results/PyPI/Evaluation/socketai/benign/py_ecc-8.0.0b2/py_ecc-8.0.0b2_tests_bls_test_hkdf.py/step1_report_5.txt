{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the HKDF (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function) implementation from the py_ecc.bls.hash module, validating correctness against RFC 5869 test vectors.",
  "sources": "Test input data such as salts, IKM (Input Keying Material), info, and expected output values, provided as hex strings within parameterized test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data are present; the code only performs deterministic cryptographic tests using hardcoded test vectors.",
  "flows": "Input data (hex-encoded strings) are converted to bytes and fed into cryptographic functions (hkdf_extract and hkdf_expand). The outputs are compared to expected values; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets are test vectors but are not secrets in the context of testing; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of test functions that verify the correctness of cryptographic HKDF functions using standard, publicly available RFC test vectors. It imports only testing and cryptographic functions. No external inputs, environment variables, or network activity are present. All test vectors are static, hardcoded, and used for validation purposes. The functions perform straightforward conversions and assertions without any suspicious behavior or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for cryptographic correctness. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and solely intended for validation of cryptographic functions.",
