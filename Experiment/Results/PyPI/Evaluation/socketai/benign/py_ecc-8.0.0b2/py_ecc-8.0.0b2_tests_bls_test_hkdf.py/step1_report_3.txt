{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the hkdf_extract and hkdf_expand functions from the py_ecc.bls.hash module, validating their correctness against RFC 5869 test vectors.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test vectors (hex strings) used as input parameters and expected output values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources, no data is received from external sources or user input; outputs are fixed test results.",
  "flows": "Inputs (hex strings) are converted to bytes and passed directly to cryptographic functions; outputs are compared against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard unit testing of well-defined cryptographic functions. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and specific cryptographic functions, then defines parameterized test cases based on RFC 5869 test vectors. It converts hex strings to bytes, invokes the cryptographic functions, and asserts equality with expected results. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, no credential handling, and no suspicious data flows. The code's structure is straightforward, focusing solely on validation of the cryptographic implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for cryptographic functions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs data validation against known test vectors, without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
