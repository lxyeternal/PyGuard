{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the hkdf_extract and hkdf_expand functions from the py_ecc.bls.hash module, verifying cryptographic hash derivation functions against known test vectors.",
  "sources": "Test parameters including salt, ikm, prk, info, length, and okm are hardcoded within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted user input or perform data output. It solely runs test assertions on cryptographic functions.",
  "flows": "Test inputs (salt, ikm, prk, info) are fed into cryptographic functions; results are compared against expected values. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets are test vectors from RFC standards, not secrets in production. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines parameterized tests for cryptographic hash functions, verifying correctness against standard test vectors. It relies on hardcoded data, which is typical in cryptographic validation. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions are for testing purposes only, not for production input handling. The absence of network operations, file access, or environment variable use further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite validating cryptographic functions with known vectors. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign and solely for ensuring cryptographic correctness.",
