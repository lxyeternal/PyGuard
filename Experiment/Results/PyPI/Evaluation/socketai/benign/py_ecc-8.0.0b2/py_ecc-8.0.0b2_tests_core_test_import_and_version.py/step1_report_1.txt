{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the importability and version string of the 'py_ecc' package and its submodules, likely for validation or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "Code reads the 'py_ecc' package version, and iterates over lazy-imported submodules to import them dynamically.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted input; it only performs imports and assertions within the local environment.",
  "flows": "Sources (package version, lazy submodule names) flow into import statements; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic imports of all lazy-loaded submodules without any validation or filtering; no credentials, secrets, or suspicious data are present. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'py_ecc' package and verifies its version string, which is a standard operation. It then imports all submodules listed in '_lazy_imports', likely a dictionary of submodule names for lazy loading. This dynamic import approach is typical for handling optional or deferred imports and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward, testing import mechanisms and version info, with no external data handling or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard import tests on the 'py_ecc' package and its submodules. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
