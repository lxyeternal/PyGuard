{
  "purpose": "The code tests the import and version retrieval of the 'py_ecc' library and its submodules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib' and 'py_ecc'; access to 'py_ecc.__version__'; iteration over '_lazy_imports' values for dynamic imports.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of submodules via importlib.import_module, potential execution of imported submodules.",
  "flows": "Import 'py_ecc' -> Access '__version__' -> Loop over '_lazy_imports' -> importlib.import_module(submod)",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with importlib for lazy-loaded submodules; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'py_ecc' and tests for its version string. It also imports all submodules listed in '_lazy_imports' dynamically using importlib. This approach ensures all lazy-loaded submodules are imported, likely for testing or initialization. There is no indication of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard testing practices for Python packages. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import testing and lazy-loading of submodules from 'py_ecc'. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate testing script for a Python package.",
