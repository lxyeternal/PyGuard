  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs straightforward import and version validation on the 'py_ecc' package and its submodules.\n- The use of '_lazy_imports' and 'importlib.import_module' is standard for lazy loading.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, network activity, or data exfiltration, are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement among the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Code behavior:** The code is a benign test suite verifying importability and version info.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **Logical errors:** None identified.\n- **Reasoning flaws:** All reports correctly interpret the code as standard and benign.\n- **Summary accuracy:** The summaries are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Risks and Their Justification:\n- The only minor point is the dynamic import of submodules, which could be risky if the list '_lazy_imports' were manipulated. However, since '_lazy_imports' is sourced from the package itself, this is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No reason to assign a higher risk score here.\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- The reports do not seem to make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, considering the use of dynamic imports, but justified as benign)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard import test for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to dynamic import, but no actual risk)\n\nThis is a benign testing script with no security concerns.",
