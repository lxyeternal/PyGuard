{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to test the import functionality and version attribute of the py_ecc package and its submodules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'py_ecc' package, its '__version__' attribute, and the submodule paths stored in '_lazy_imports'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source reads from the package metadata and the lazy imports list; these flows do not lead to any external output or harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic import of submodules via importlib.import_module, which is standard for lazy-loading but could be suspicious if the list of submodules is manipulated. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward import operations to verify package version and lazy load submodules, using standard Python importlib mechanisms. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities are present. The use of lazy imports is common for performance and modularity. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be benign and focused on testing module importability and version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple test of the py_ecc package's importability and version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
