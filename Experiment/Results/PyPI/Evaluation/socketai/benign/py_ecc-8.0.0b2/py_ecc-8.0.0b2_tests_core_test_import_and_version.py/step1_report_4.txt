{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the importability and version string of the 'py_ecc' package and its submodules.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'py_ecc' package and its __version__ attribute; reading from the '_lazy_imports' dictionary to get submodule names",
  "sinks": "Importing modules dynamically via importlib, which can execute module code upon import",
  "flows": "Source: accessing 'py_ecc.__version__' and '_lazy_imports' -> Sink: importlib.import_module(submod) to load submodules",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy imports suggests attempts to delay module loading, but no suspicious code or hardcoded credentials detected; no obfuscated code or malicious payloads observed",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward import and version checks on 'py_ecc' and its submodules. The use of '_lazy_imports' indicates a design choice for deferred importing but does not imply malicious intent. All operations are standard Python testing practices. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are apparent. The dynamic import via importlib is safe in this context, assuming the package is from a trusted source.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign test suite for the 'py_ecc' package, focusing on importability and version validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
