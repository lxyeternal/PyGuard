  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The provided code snippets are functions testing backward compatibility for importing modules and constants from the `py_ecc` library.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward import statements and a simple usage example for `bn128`.\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Reported Issues:**\n   - All reports show `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no additional details.\n   - This suggests that the reports lack substantive information about potential vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or flaws.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are essentially empty; they do not contain any analysis, findings, or evidence.\n   - As such, they do not provide any basis for assessing malware, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no issues are described, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be 0, as there is no evidence of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be 0, given the absence of any reported or detected issues.\n   - If any scores are higher than 0.5, they are unjustified and should be lowered accordingly.\n\n5. **Potential for Malicious Activity:**\n   - The code snippets are typical import and usage tests for a cryptography library.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n   - The empty reports do not suggest any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, they do not make any claims, assumptions, or conclusions.\n   - Therefore, there's no basis to challenge or validate any claims.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code itself is benign and standard.\n- The reports are empty and do not contain any findings.\n- The scores should all be set to 0, reflecting no detected issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest any security concern from the provided code or the reports.",
