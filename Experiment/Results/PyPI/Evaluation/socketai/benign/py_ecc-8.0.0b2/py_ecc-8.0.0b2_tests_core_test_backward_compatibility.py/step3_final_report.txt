{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify backward compatibility of import paths and interface consistency across different modules and versions of the py_ecc library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from py_ecc modules and attribute access within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code performs static imports and simple function calls without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements and attribute references flow into basic function calls, with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with standard import and usage patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two test functions that check import paths and basic functionality of py_ecc modules. It performs static imports and a simple curve point check, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The reports are empty, providing no additional findings or concerns. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility testing code with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
