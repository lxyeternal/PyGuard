{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite using pytest to verify the correctness of the 'prime_field_inv' function from the 'py_ecc.utils' module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a', 'n', and 'result' from the parameterized test cases.",
  "sinks": "The 'assert' statement that checks the modular inverse result.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the 'prime_field_inv' function, and its output is used in a modular operation for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code relies on an external library function; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest unit test for the 'prime_field_inv' function, providing multiple test cases to verify its correctness. It imports only a utility function from a known cryptographic library and performs straightforward assertions. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code is structured normally for testing purposes and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign test script for verifying a mathematical utility function. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
