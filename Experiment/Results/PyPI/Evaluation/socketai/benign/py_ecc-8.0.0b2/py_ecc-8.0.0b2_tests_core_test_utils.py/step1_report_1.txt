  "purpose": "Unit testing the prime_field_inv function from the py_ecc.utils module to verify modular inverse computations.",
  "sources": "pytest framework invoking test_prime_field_inv; importing prime_field_inv function from py_ecc.utils.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output effects observed.",
  "flows": "Test inputs (a, n) are passed into prime_field_inv; results are validated via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs; standard testing pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function for modular inverse calculation and uses pytest to parameterize multiple test cases. The test inputs are straightforward integers, and the assertions check the correctness of the function. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code activity. Usage appears typical for unit testing and does not involve any network operations, system modifications, or obfuscated code. No anomalous or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a mathematical utility function, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate test script for verifying the correctness of cryptographic utility functions.",
