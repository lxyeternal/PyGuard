{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the function 'prime_field_inv' from the 'py_ecc.utils' module, intended to verify the correctness of modular inverse calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input values 'a', 'n', and 'result' from parameterized test cases.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'assert' statement to verify that the computed inverse matches expected results; no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('a', 'n') are fed into 'prime_field_inv', and the result is validated against 'result'. No external data flow or network activity is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual constructs. The code appears to be straightforward test code with standard use of pytest.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function for modular inverse calculation and runs multiple parameterized tests to check its correctness. It uses pytest markers and assertions typical for testing frameworks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The function under test may involve complex mathematics, but the test code itself remains standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal, benign test script for verifying a mathematical utility function. No malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security issues detected.",
