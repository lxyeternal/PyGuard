  "purpose": "Unit test for the 'prime_field_inv' function from the py_ecc.utils module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the test function: 'a', 'n', 'result'. No external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Assertion statement verifying the output of 'prime_field_inv' modulo 'n'. No sinks leading to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> 'prime_field_inv' function -> assertion check.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code appears to be a straightforward test case.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function, sets up parameterized test cases, and verifies the correctness of 'prime_field_inv'. The parameters are simple integers; no external input, environment variables, or data from untrusted sources are involved. The test aims to confirm mathematical correctness. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a mathematical utility function, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or handle sensitive data.",
