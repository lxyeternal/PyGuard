  "purpose": "Unit test for the 'prime_field_inv' function from the 'py_ecc.utils' module, verifying modular inverse calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a', 'n', and 'result' from the parametrize decorator, which supply test data.",
  "sinks": "Assertion statement 'assert prime_field_inv(a, n) % n == result', which compares function output to expected result.",
  "flows": "Test data (a, n, result) -> prime_field_inv(a, n) -> modulo operation -> comparison to result.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs detected. The test appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest unit test. It tests the 'prime_field_inv' function with various inputs to verify correctness. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is present. The function likely computes modular inverses, a common mathematical operation in cryptography, with no signs of malicious intent. The test uses typical pytest features and does not introduce any suspicious code or data flow.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard unit test for a cryptographic utility function, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
