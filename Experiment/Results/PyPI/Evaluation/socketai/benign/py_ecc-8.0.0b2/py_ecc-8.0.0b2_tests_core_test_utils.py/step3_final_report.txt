  "purpose": "Unit test for the prime_field_inv function from py_ecc.utils, verifying modular inverse calculations with multiple test cases.",
  "sources": "The test inputs are hardcoded integers within the parameterized test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code only performs assertions on mathematical functions.",
  "flows": "Input integers are passed to prime_field_inv, and results are compared to expected values; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and standard for testing cryptographic utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured pytest suite testing the correctness of a modular inverse function. It uses parameterized inputs and assertions, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external dependencies beyond the utility function. The reports uniformly identify it as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero malware and security risk scores. The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying a cryptographic utility function. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
