  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines error codes/messages for Tencent cloud services.\n- Data flow: None; static constants only.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign constants module.\n- Malware score: 0 — accurate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, error codes for Tencent cloud SDK.\n- Data flow: None; purely constant definitions.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Standard, benign constants.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Error codes for Tencent cloud security SDK.\n- Data flow: No; constants only.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Normal, safe constants.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Error code constants for Tencent cloud services.\n- Data flow: None.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Standard, safe constants.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Error code constants for Tencent cloud SDK.\n- Data flow: None.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Benign constants module.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No. All reports correctly identify that this is a static constants module with no executable logic, data processing, or external dependencies.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:** The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note the benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:** None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign constants module defining error codes and messages for Tencent cloud SDKs/APIs. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis is needed.",
