{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing various error codes and messages used for handling authentication, authorization, operational failures, and parameter validation in a Tencent cloud service context.",
  "sources": "These constants are defined within the script and do not read input or external data; no data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data flows to cause data leaks, execution, or other effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script solely declares constants without logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only constant definitions with descriptive error code strings; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic is present. No hardcoded secrets such as passwords, API keys, or tokens are evident. The license header indicates legitimate origin from Tencent. No backdoors or malicious behaviors are observable.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises a straightforward declaration of string constants representing various error and status codes related to Tencent cloud operations. It appears to be part of a larger SDK or API error handling module. The structure is simple, with no logic, data processing, or network operations. The lack of any suspicious or malicious constructs indicates this is a standard, benign error code definitions file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of constant definitions for error handling in Tencent cloud services. It contains no malicious code, no obfuscated segments, and no suspicious behavior. It is a standard, legitimate component of a cloud SDK or API implementation.",
