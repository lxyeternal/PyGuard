  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely a static list of string constants representing error codes and messages.\n   - No dynamic logic, data processing, input/output, or network operations are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or secret data.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify that this is a benign constants module.\n   - They correctly note the absence of executable logic, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0.\n   - These are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only constant definitions with no executable or dynamic components, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior; the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they treat the code as a benign constants module.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis code is a straightforward, static declaration of error code constants used in Tencent's SDK or API. It poses no security risk, no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a safe, standard component of an SDK, with no security concerns.",
