{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing error codes and messages for Tencent cloud services, used for error handling and response interpretation.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; constants are used as identifiers and messages in error handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; constants are referenced where needed in error handling logic elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns; straightforward constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of string constants for error codes, with licensing comments. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external dependencies. The constants are standard for SDK error handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely definitional, serving as a reference for error states. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. The code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard constants module for error codes used in Tencent cloud SDKs. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The error codes are typical and do not pose any security threat.",
