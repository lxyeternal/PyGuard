  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a static collection of error code constants; no data input or external dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or output points; purely constant definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** It’s a benign constants module for error handling. No signs of malware or security risks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of constant definitions.\n- No dynamic behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate, and safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the potential exposure of error codes, but these are standard in SDKs.\n- No executable logic or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Error codes are exposed but that’s typical; no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that these are static string constants with no processing or dynamic code.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard error code definitions.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the static, non-executable nature.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard constants module.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports agree that this is purely a collection of static error code constants with no executable logic, data processing, or external dependencies.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident. The exposure of error codes is typical and does not constitute a security risk.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Based on the provided code, there are no vulnerabilities. The constants are for error handling, not for executing or processing untrusted data.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0 — standard constants, no security concern.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The report's scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a standard, benign constants module defining error codes for Tencent cloud services. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The error codes are meant for API responses and error handling, which is typical and safe.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
