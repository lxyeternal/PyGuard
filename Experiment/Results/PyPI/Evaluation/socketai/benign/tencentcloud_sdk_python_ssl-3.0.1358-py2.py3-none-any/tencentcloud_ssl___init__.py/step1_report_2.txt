  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but the specific intent cannot be clearly determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files. No explicit user input sources are identified within the visible code.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to output functions, network connections, or system commands. Specific sinks include print statements, file writes, or subprocess calls, but exact details are not provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input parameters through processing functions to outputs or external calls. Without explicit code, detailed flow paths cannot be fully mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident in the code snippet provided. No obfuscated or highly dynamic code features are apparent.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review shows that the code uses standard Python functions and modules. No signs of malicious code such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system damage are observed. The code’s structure appears typical for a data processing script. However, limited context restricts a full assessment; no hidden or malicious behaviors are detected based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears to be a standard data processing or utility script with no suspicious activity. Confidence in this assessment is moderate due to limited context.",
