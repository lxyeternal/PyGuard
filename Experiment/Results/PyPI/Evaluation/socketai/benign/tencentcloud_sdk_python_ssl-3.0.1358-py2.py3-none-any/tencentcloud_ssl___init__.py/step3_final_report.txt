  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code signals such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external modules, function parameters, potential network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, system commands, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) through processing functions, potentially leading to sinks like network transmission, file writes, or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, lack of comments, dynamic code constructs, high obfuscation scores, absence of documentation or comments.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of concealment. No explicit malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or damaging system files are observed. The high obfuscation score (0.8) and dynamic code features suggest potential malicious intent, but without concrete evidence, the malware score remains low (0.2). The benign code segments with no suspicious patterns justify low malware and risk scores. The confidence level is moderate to high (0.6-0.8), given the suspicion raised by obfuscation but lack of definitive malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that the code is mostly benign, with the exception of report 5, which shows obfuscation and dynamic features warranting increased suspicion. The current scores are generally appropriate; however, the malware score for report 5 should be increased from 0.2 to approximately 0.5 to better reflect the potential threat posed by obfuscation and concealment tactics. No other significant adjustments are necessary.",
