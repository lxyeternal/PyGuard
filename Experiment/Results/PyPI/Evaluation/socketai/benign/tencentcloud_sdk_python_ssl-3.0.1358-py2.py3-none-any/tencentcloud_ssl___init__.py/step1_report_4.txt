  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility task within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or external files (if present). Specific source points are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands, if used. The provided code does not explicitly show these actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions and potentially toward sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed step-by-step: It begins with standard imports and function definitions, handling data input and processing. No malicious or suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution or backdoors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, with no signs of malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets or obvious malicious behavior. The overall code structure and logic are consistent with normal application code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
