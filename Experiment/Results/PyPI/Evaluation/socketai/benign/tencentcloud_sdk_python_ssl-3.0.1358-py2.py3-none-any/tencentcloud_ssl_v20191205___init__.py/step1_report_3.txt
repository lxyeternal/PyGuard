{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit purpose provided. It seems to perform some data processing or utility functions based on the structure.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to standard output, logs, or external files. Potentially sensitive data could be exposed if untrusted input is processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions through processing functions to output or storage points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are apparent. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, following typical Python patterns. It does not include any suspicious external network connections, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets. The absence of obfuscation and benign structure suggest no malicious intent. The code uses common libraries and idioms, and there are no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It appears to be a standard utility script with no hidden malicious intent.",
