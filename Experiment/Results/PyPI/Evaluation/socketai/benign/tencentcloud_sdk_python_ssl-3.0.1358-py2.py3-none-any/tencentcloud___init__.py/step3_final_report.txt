  "purpose": "This code serves as a header containing licensing information and a version identifier for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = '3.0.1358') and the comment block containing license details.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code is static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code consists solely of comments and a variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign metadata, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The confidence level is high (1.0) given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No issues or vulnerabilities are present, and the code poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign header with licensing and version information. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements and is safe for use.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
