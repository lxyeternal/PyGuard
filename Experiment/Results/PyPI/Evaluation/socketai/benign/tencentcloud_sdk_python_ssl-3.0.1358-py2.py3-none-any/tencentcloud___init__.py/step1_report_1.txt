  "purpose": "The code appears to be a metadata header and license information for a software component, likely a library or package, indicating versioning and licensing details.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the comments and license information at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output operations, or processing logic that connect sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of comments and license statements with no executable code or dynamic content. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata and licensing information, with no executable instructions or data processing. It includes licensing boilerplate and version information, which are typical in source files. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Given the absence of executable logic, this code cannot perform any malicious actions or security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is non-executable metadata and licensing comments. It poses no security risk, does not contain malware, and has no obfuscation. It is safe and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
