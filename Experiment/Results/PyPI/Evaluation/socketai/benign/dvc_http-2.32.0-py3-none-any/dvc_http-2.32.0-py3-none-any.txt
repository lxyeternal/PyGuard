      "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, straightforward customization of an HTTP client to control retry behavior, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscated score 0, and the risk score can be set to 0 for precision."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward static file server with upload capabilities. While there are minor security considerations—such as potential directory traversal if translate_path isn't sanitized and the use of MD5 for checksum—there's no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting these considerations but not malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no confirmed malicious indicators. The scores are appropriately cautious, especially regarding dynamic code execution in report 4. Minor adjustments, such as lowering malware score in report 4 to 0, are not necessary as suspicion is justified. The overall security posture based on these reports is low risk."
