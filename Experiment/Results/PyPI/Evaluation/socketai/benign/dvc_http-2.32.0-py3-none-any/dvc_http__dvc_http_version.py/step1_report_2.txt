{
  "purpose": "Define version information and types for the package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and tuple '__version_tuple__'. No input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects. No external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The version data is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with standard versioning assignments and type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing annotations based on TYPE_CHECKING. It assigns static version information to variables. No dynamic or user input handling occurs. The code includes comments warning not to change or track in version control, but these are benign annotations related to version management. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present, nor is there obfuscated or malicious code pattern. Overall, this appears to be boilerplate version management code generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration snippet, with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It is standard versioning boilerplate for a Python package.",
