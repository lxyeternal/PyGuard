{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, using static assignment and conditional type hints.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples assigned directly to variables; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, generated boilerplate with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, generated version declaration with no dynamic or malicious components. It employs standard practices for type hinting and version assignment. No external inputs, data flows, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code. The logic is consistent, and no issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate version declaration snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are accurate and justified, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
