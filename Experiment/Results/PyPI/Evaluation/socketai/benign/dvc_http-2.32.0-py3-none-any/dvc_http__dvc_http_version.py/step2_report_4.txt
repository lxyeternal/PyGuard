  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration generated by setuptools_scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples to variables.\n- It uses standard conditional type hinting with `TYPE_CHECKING`.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or obfuscation is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence Confirmation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and generated boilerplate.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present in the code snippet.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overlook any suspicious behaviors.\n- The conclusion in each report that the code is benign and safe is justified.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n- Given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate.\n- The `confidence` score of 1 is justified, as the analysis is thorough and conclusive.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is static, has no external input, and performs no malicious actions, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Potential Assumptions or Claims:\n- All reports correctly challenge any assumptions of malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as boilerplate.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, static version declaration with no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The analysis and scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No changes are necessary.",
