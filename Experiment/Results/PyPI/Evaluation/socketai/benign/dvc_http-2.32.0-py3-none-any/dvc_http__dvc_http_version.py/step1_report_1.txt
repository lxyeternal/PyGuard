{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and manages version data types and constants.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input or output points.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded version string is assigned to multiple variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard. No suspicious or unusual code structures. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version declaration setup with conditional type annotations for static type checking. It assigns static version data to variables. There are no external inputs, no runtime data processing, and no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
