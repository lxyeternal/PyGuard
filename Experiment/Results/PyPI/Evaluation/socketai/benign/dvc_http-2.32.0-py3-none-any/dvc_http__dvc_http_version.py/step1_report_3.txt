{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and is used to manage package versioning without manual updates.",
  "sources": "The code reads static version string and tuple assignments, which are hardcoded in the source.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points; the code does not process external input or produce external outputs that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned directly from hardcoded values; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code includes a typical pattern for version management, with no obfuscation, hidden logic, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm. It includes conditional type checking and static assignment of version variables, with no dynamic code execution, external data input, or insecure practices observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
