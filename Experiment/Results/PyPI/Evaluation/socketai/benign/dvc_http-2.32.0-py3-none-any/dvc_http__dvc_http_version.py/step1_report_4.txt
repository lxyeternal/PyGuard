{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage version information consistently.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only assigns static string and tuple values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could cause data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the version variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code includes standard version management patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports type hints and sets version variables accordingly, but ultimately assigns static, hardcoded version strings and tuples. There is no external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be boilerplate generated code for version management, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard version definition snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
