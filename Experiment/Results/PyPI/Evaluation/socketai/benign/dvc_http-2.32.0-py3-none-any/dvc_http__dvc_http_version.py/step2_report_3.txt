  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration, generated by `setuptools_scm`.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples to variables.\n   - Uses conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints, which is standard practice.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no external input, no obfuscation, no hidden behaviors.\n   - All variables are hardcoded with version info, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Considerations**:\n   - The reports correctly identify the absence of untrusted data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or code that could be exploited.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate; they recognize this as boilerplate version info.\n   - No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - Since the code is static, generated, and contains no malicious logic, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly 0; there's no obfuscation.\n   - The overall risk score is correctly 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is benign, standard boilerplate for version management.\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.
