{
  "purpose": "The code is importing all fixtures from external modules, likely for testing purposes in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dvc.testing.fixtures' and local '.fixtures' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or effects present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths, as these are purely import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports with comments disabling pylint and noqa warnings; no actual malicious code or secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports, which can be risky for namespace pollution but not inherently malicious. The comments indicate an intentional override of static analysis warnings. No suspicious behaviors, malicious actions, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not perform any data handling, network operations, or security-critical functions.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard import statement block for test fixtures, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of wildcard imports is a code style concern but not indicative of malicious behavior.",
