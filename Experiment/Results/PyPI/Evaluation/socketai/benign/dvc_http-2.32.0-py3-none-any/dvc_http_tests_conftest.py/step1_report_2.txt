  "purpose": "Import fixtures and testing utilities from external modules for use in testing environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules ('dvc.testing.fixtures' and local '.fixtures')",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; imports are static and not dynamic or user-input driven",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import statements do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports with noqa and pylint disable comments, which can obscure which symbols are imported but do not inherently indicate malicious intent; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements pulling in fixtures for testing. The use of wildcard imports with disabling lint warnings suggests a potential for namespace pollution, but this is a common pattern in test setups and does not imply malicious behavior. No data is read from untrusted sources, no code injection, and no suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test fixture import, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of wildcards and suppression comments is typical in test code and does not constitute a security concern.",
