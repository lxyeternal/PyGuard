  "purpose": "Import fixtures for testing purposes, setting up the test environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the imported modules 'dvc.testing.fixtures' and local 'fixtures'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports with suppression comments to disable static analysis warnings; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with comments disabling linter warnings. These are typical in test setup files to include fixtures. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The wildcard imports and suppression comments are common in test code but can obscure namespace pollution; however, they do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test fixture import pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The minor risk score reflects potential namespace pollution issues but does not indicate actual security risks. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
