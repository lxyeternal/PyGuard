  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports with noqa and pylint disables, which could hide malicious or unnecessary code. No explicit code execution or data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements for fixtures from external modules, including a third-party package (dvc.testing) and a relative import. The wildcard imports are potentially risky as they can bring in unintended or malicious code, but in this context, they are used solely for test fixtures. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activity, such as code injection, network communication, or data leaks. The use of noqa and pylint disables indicates an attempt to suppress warnings, which might obscure issues but does not inherently suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to importing test fixtures, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The use of wildcard imports should be noted but is common in test setup scripts. No malware or malicious behavior is apparent.",
