  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports with comments to disable linting; no specific anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with comments disabling linter warnings. These imports bring in fixtures for testing, which is common in test scripts. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any data handling, network communication, or system modification. The import statements appear standard for test setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test setup snippet importing fixtures; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
