  "purpose": "The code imports fixtures from the 'dvc.testing.fixtures' and local 'fixtures' modules, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dvc.testing.fixtures' and local 'fixtures' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not handle untrusted data or perform data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows; import statements do not process untrusted input or data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports with noqa and pylint disables, which may obscure imported contents but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that include wildcard imports with suppression comments. There are no data processing, external data handling, or code execution beyond imports. Wildcard imports can hide potentially unused or malicious code but are common in testing modules. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident from these lines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of fixtures for testing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard imports is a code quality concern but not malicious.",
