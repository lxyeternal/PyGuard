{
  "purpose": "Define a custom HTTPFileSystem class that allows setting a default upload method and overrides the asynchronous file upload method.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the class with parameters, usage of self.upload_method in _put_file method.",
  "sinks": "The _put_file method calls the superclass method with a customizable HTTP method, potentially influencing HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation → setting upload_method → calling _put_file → passing method parameter to parent method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code simply extends existing functionality with configurable HTTP method.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the 'http.HTTPFileSystem' class from fsspec, adding a parameter to set the upload method ('post' by default). The overridden _put_file method ensures the upload method can be dynamically set. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Usage of asynchronous methods is standard and appropriate. The code appears to be a benign customization of a standard library class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward subclass modification to allow configurable upload methods for HTTP file uploads. There are no malicious indicators or security risks present. It appears safe and typical for extending functionality.",
