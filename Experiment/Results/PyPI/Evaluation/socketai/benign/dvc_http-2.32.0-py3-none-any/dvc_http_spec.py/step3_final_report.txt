  "purpose": "Subclass extending fsspec.implementations.http.HTTPFileSystem to add configurable upload HTTP method.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameter 'upload_method'; the '_put_file' method which sets the 'method' in kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The '_put_file' method passes 'method' to the superclass; no untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The 'upload_method' attribute influences the 'method' parameter in '_put_file', which then calls the superclass method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; straightforward extension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that adds an 'upload_method' parameter with default 'post'. It overrides '_put_file' to set the 'method' parameter dynamically based on this attribute, then calls the parent method. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The flexibility allows changing HTTP methods for uploads, which is benign. The code's logic is correct, with no signs of malicious intent or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and flexible nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward extension enabling configurable HTTP methods for file uploads. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
