{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom subclass of an HTTP-based filesystem class for handling file uploads with configurable HTTP methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the constructor (__init__) and the _put_file method, particularly self.upload_method and method in kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The _put_file method invokes super()._put_file with a method parameter, which could lead to untrusted data affecting the HTTP request method.",
  "flows": "The upload_method attribute influences the 'method' parameter in _put_file, which is then used in an HTTP request for uploading files.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically sets the HTTP method for uploading files based on an input parameter; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an existing HTTP file system class to allow customizable HTTP methods for file uploads. It passes the upload_method parameter from initialization into the request method, defaulting to 'post'. The use of async in _put_file indicates asynchronous operation. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure appears straightforward and aligns with typical extension patterns. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or suspicious control flow are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension to an HTTP file system class, enabling configurable upload methods without any malicious or maliciously intended behavior. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
