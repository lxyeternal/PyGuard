{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom HTTP client class that modifies retry behavior for HTTP methods, specifically disabling retries for PUT and POST requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the class constructor parameters (`args`, `kwargs`) and from method calls (`super().__init__()`, `super().post()`, `super().put()`).",
  "sinks": "The code writes to `kwargs['retry_options']` which affects the behavior of the underlying HTTP requests. No untrusted data processing or external output is present.",
  "flows": "Initialization sets up retry options (`self._write_opts`). When `post` or `put` methods are called, they modify the `kwargs` to set retry options and pass control to parent class methods, dictating request retry behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The retry configuration appears standard and intended for controlling request retries.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an existing RetryClient to customize retry behavior. It sets a retry policy that disables retries for PUT/POST by setting `attempts=1`. The methods override the parent class methods to enforce this behavior. The implementation is straightforward and consistent with common use of aiohttp_retry. No malicious or suspicious code, data leaks, or security issues are evident. The code only manipulates retry logic, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of an HTTP client for controlling retry logic, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply modifies retry behavior for specific HTTP methods.",
