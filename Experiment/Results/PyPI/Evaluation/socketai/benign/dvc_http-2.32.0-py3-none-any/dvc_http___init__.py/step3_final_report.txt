  "purpose": "Implement classes for HTTP/HTTPS filesystem access, managing credentials, SSL contexts, and network requests.",
  "sources": "User input via getpass, configuration parameters for SSL verification, credential data from config, and network request setup.",
  "sinks": "Network requests using aiohttp, passing credentials and headers, SSL context creation, and potential data flow into network communication.",
  "flows": "Input from getpass or config -> SSL context creation or credential assignment -> aiohttp client setup -> network request execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic SSL context loading from user-supplied paths; password prompts via getpass are standard but could be misused if embedded maliciously. No obfuscation or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard classes for HTTP/HTTPS filesystem access, handling credentials securely via getpass, creating SSL contexts from user input or paths, and setting up network clients with retries and timeouts. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; the credential handling and SSL setup follow common practices. The use of getpass is appropriate for secure password input, and dynamic SSL context creation is typical for configurable clients. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and potential configuration considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for remote HTTP/HTTPS filesystem access, with proper credential and SSL management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score reflects standard configuration points rather than actual threats.",
