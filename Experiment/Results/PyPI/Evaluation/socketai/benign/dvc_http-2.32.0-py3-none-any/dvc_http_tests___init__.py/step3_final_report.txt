  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data handling functions, network requests, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (environment variables, data inputs) potentially leading to network/file operations or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec functions, dynamic code patterns, handling of environment variables, absence of explicit malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code shows typical data processing with no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful network connections. The presence of eval/exec is flagged as suspicious but not confirmed as malicious. Scores reflect cautious assessment: malware score at 0.2 for report 4 due to eval/exec suspicion; other reports correctly score 0.0 for malware. Security risk scores are modest (~0.2), acknowledging potential issues with environment variables and dynamic features. Confidence levels are appropriate given the evidence. No obfuscation is observed across reports. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no confirmed malicious indicators. The scores are appropriately cautious, especially regarding dynamic code execution in report 4. Minor adjustments, such as lowering malware score in report 4 to 0, are not necessary as suspicion is justified. The overall security posture based on these reports is low risk.",
