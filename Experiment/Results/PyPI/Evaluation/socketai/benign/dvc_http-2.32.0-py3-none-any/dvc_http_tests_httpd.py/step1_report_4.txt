{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple HTTP server for serving static files with support for range requests and chunked uploads.",
  "sources": "Reads files from disk in end_headers method; reads request body data in do_POST method; reads headers for 'Range' and 'Content-Length'.",
  "sinks": "Sends headers with checksum (Content-MD5); writes uploaded data to disk; processes request headers; opens files for reading and writing.",
  "flows": "Header 'Range' check leads to adding 'Accept-Ranges'; file content read for checksum; POST data read from request, written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious URL domains; checksum calculation is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The server provides static file serving with range support and allows file uploads via POST requests. It calculates MD5 checksums of files to include in headers. No user input is used in dangerous ways; file paths are derived from request URLs, which could potentially be manipulated, but there is no evident malicious behavior or secret handling. The code appears standard and safe. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The only notable aspect is the checksum header, which is a common integrity feature, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a static file server with upload capability. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious intent. It performs typical server functions without malicious side effects.",
