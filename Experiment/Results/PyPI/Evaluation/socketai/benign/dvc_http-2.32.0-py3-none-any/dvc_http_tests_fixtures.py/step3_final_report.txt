  "flows": "os.fspath -> static_file_server -> HTTP.get_url -> HTTP constructor",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test setup involving temporary directory creation, server instantiation, and HTTP client creation. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code uses standard testing fixtures and functions, with no network exfiltration or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the context, reflecting minimal risk associated with network setup in a testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test fixture setup with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
