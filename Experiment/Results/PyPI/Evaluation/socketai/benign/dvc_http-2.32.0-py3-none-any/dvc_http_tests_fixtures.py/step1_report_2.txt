  "sources": "os.fspath (to convert path), static_file_server (to serve files), HTTP.get_url (to generate URLs)",
  "sinks": "HTTP constructor (potential network communication), static_file_server (network server setup)",
  "flows": "static_file_server creates server -> HTTP.get_url retrieves server URL -> HTTP constructor uses URL",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of testing fixtures is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest fixtures to set up an HTTP server with a temporary directory, then creates an HTTP client to connect to it. All components are related to testing HTTP interactions, with no evidence of data leakage, malicious network activity, or code injection. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard testing setup for an HTTP server and client, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a typical fixture setup for unit tests.",
