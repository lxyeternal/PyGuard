  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, specifying project info, extensions, templates, and HTML options.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine current file path; modifies sys.path to include parent directories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity; no code execution or external commands.",
  "flows": "Uses __file__ as source to determine path, then inserts parent directory into sys.path; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Standard sys.path modification; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, modifies sys.path for local module access, and sets configuration variables for Sphinx. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The sys.path modification is typical for documentation projects and does not indicate malicious intent. No external data handling, network activity, or code injection is observed. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The modification of sys.path is typical and not malicious in this context. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
