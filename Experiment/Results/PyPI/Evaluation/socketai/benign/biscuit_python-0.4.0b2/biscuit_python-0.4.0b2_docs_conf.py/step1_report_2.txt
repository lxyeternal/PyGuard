  "purpose": "Configure the Sphinx documentation builder for the project 'biscuit-python'.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine the script location; modifies sys.path to include parent directories.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modification could influence module loading; __file__ usage is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "The code uses __file__ to resolve a directory path and inserts it into sys.path, influencing module import paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The sys.path modification is typical for documentation setups.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up project info and documentation configurations using standard Sphinx practices. The sys.path insertion manipulates import paths, which is common for local module references during documentation generation. No untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for Sphinx with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks.",
