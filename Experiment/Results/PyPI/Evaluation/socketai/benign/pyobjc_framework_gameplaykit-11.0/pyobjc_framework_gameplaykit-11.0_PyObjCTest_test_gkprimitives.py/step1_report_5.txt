  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and gameplay framework classes. It defines test methods that check the type strings and default attribute values of specific structs. The code appears to be standard unit testing without any dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communication. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward unit test code for verifying structure definitions and default attribute values. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
