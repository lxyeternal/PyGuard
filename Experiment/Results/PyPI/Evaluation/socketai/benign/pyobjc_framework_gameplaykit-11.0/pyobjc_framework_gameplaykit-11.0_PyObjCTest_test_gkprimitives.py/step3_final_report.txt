  "purpose": "Verify class attribute strings (__typestr__) and default attribute values (e.g., boxMin, boxMax, quadMin, quadMax, points) of GameplayKit primitives GKBox, GKQuad, and GKTriangle.",
  "sources": "Class definitions of GKBox, GKQuad, GKTriangle; instantiation of these classes; attribute access for __typestr__, boxMin, boxMax, quadMin, quadMax, points.",
  "sinks": "None; code performs static attribute checks and assertions without external data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Access __typestr__ and default attributes -> Assertions to verify expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward unit test code with no obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test verifying class attribute strings and default attribute values for GKBox, GKQuad, and GKTriangle. It performs direct assertions without external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is purely to validate data structure definitions. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code clarity. The security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal security concern typical for test code. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test verifying class attributes and default values of GameplayKit primitives. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
