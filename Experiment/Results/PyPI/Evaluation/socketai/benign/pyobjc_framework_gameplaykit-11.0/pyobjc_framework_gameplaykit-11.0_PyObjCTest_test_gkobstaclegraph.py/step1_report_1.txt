  "purpose": "Unit test class for GameplayKit's GKObstacleGraph methods, specifically testing boolean result functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools and GameplayKit modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only calls an assertion method on a class method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and a graphics/game development framework, then defines a test case to verify that the method 'isConnectionLockedFromNode_toNode_' correctly returns a boolean. The test uses an assertion method typical in unit testing to check the method's result type. There are no inputs, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard unit test for a specific framework component.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward unit test script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only performs a simple assertion on a method’s return type within a test framework.",
