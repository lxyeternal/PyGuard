    "No explicit code injection or data leakage mechanisms identified, but subprocess output could be exploited if environment variables or system commands are compromised."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a build and setup script for the PyObjC framework. It interacts with system commands to gather OS and SDK information, modifies system paths for testing, and manages build configurations. Although subprocess calls are used to retrieve system and compiler info, these are standard practices in build scripts. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or reverse shell mechanisms are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The script does perform file operations and environment manipulations typical for setup processes, which could pose risks if system or environment variables are tampered with, but these are not inherently malicious. Overall, the script's intent aligns with legitimate build and testing procedures, and no malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup and build configuration script for the PyObjC framework, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It includes system info gathering, dependency management, and test execution, all within expected patterns for such scripts. While subprocess calls and environment manipulations could be exploited in compromised environments, there is no indication of malicious activity in the code itself.",
