  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and test setup script for PyObjC, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The subprocess calls, environment manipulations, and filesystem operations are typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential environment manipulation vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose."
