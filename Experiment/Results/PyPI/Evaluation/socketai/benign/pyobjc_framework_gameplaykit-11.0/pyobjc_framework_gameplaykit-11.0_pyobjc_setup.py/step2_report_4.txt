  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build script, uses environment variables, subprocess for system info, file operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes system commands (sw_vers, clang), reads/writes files, modifies sys.path for testing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, subprocess calls are typical for build scripts, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is a typical build/test setup with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in nature, emphasizing environment variables and subprocess calls for system info, SDK detection, and build configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; subprocess calls are standard. Potential risk if environment variables are maliciously manipulated, but no malicious intent evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on SDK detection, environment info, dynamic test module import.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; subprocess calls are standard. No network activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Emphasizes system info gathering, environment setup, and test management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Typical build script behavior; subprocess calls could be exploited if environment is compromised, but no malicious activity is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous, focusing on build/test orchestration, environment detection, and subprocess execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard subprocess usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of Issues in Code:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as a standard build and test script.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** The reports are consistent and well-reasoned; no logical flaws detected.\n- **Scores for Malware & Obfuscated:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis; no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting typical build script risks due to environment manipulation but no malicious activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code primarily interacts with system utilities for system info, SDK detection, and build configuration.\n- It performs dynamic module imports for testing, file reads/writes, and environment variable checks—all standard for build scripts.\n- No network activity, no code injection, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The subprocess calls are typical and necessary for system info gathering; they do not constitute malicious behavior.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious intent or activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, reflecting the potential for environment manipulation but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code is a standard build/test setup with no signs of malicious activity.",
