{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases for GameplayKit's game model protocols and constants, including a helper class implementing protocol methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (PyObjCTools, objc, GameplayKit), class method definitions, constants, and test assertions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data outputs or external network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily performs unit testing on known classes and constants without untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a helper class that implements protocol methods with static returns. The test cases verify constants and method signatures. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious activity. The focus appears to be on ensuring correct integration with GameplayKit protocols and constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test setup for GameplayKit protocols and constants, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve legitimate testing purposes only.",
