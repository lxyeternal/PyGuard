  "purpose": "Unit testing for GameplayKit classes and protocols, specifically for GKAgent and related types.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools, GameplayKit, and objc; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static method calls and property assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected; code appears to be standard test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs protocol verification and method property type assertions for GameplayKit classes, conditioned on OS version. It utilizes standard testing practices without dynamic code execution, external data, or suspicious operations. All functions are self-contained and serve validation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test module verifying protocol existence and method signatures for GameplayKit classes. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks present. It appears safe and legitimate.",
