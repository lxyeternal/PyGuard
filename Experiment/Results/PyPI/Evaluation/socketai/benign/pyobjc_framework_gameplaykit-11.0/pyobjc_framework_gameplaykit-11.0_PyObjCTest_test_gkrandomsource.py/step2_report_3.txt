  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a helper class for testing GKRandomSource protocols, using method stubs returning fixed values.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no external inputs or network activity. The code is standard unit testing code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low). This seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type assertions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no external data handling, purely for protocol conformance testing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—test helper class with fixed return values.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, no network or data exfiltration, just test scaffolding.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar test setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code, static return values typical for testing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—test helpers and protocol verification.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, straightforward test code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate benign test code with no malicious behavior. The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all are straightforward test helpers.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (test scaffolding with static return values), the risk scores are appropriately low, mostly 0 or 0.1.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1 (minimal, due to the nature of test code)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be standard, benign testing scaffolding for framework conformance verification. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are accurate and reasonable.",
