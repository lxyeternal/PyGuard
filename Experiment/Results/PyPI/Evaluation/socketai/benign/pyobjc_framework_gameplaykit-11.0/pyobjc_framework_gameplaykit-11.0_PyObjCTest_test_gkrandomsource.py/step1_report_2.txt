{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for GameplayKit's GKRandom protocol and its implementation in Objective-C via Python bindings.",
  "sources": "import statements, method definitions within TestGKRandomSourceHelper class",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; primarily type assertions and method implementations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed",
  "anomalies": "The methods return constant values without using any input or randomness; no external data handling or environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class implementing random number generator methods returning constant values, likely for testing purposes. The methods do not process input data or access external resources. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The purpose appears to be to test protocol conformance and method typing. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward unit test helper for protocol conformance, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines stub methods returning fixed values for testing purposes.",
