{
  "purpose": "The code provides a test helper class and a test case for the GameplayKit framework, focusing on protocol and method verification.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport, objc, and GameplayKit modules; class definitions; method implementations returning constant values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input sources or output sinks are present; no data leaks or system effects are observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only defines methods returning static values for testing purposes.",
  "anomalies": "Methods return hardcoded constant values (e.g., 1) which are typical in test stubs; no suspicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class inheriting from an Objective-C class and a test class utilizing assertions to verify protocol existence and method signatures. No external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The return values are static and used solely for testing, indicating benign intent. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be standard testing scaffolding for framework verification, with no malicious or suspicious components. It is safe and intended for test validation purposes.",
