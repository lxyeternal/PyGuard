{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a PyObjC wrapper around the macOS 'GameplayKit' framework, configuring extension modules and dependencies without processing untrusted input or executing malicious code.",
  "sources": "Reading module files from the 'Modules' directory, importing setup functions, and defining extension modules and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; the script does not perform network operations or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Module file listing from 'Modules' directory to extension module configuration; dependency declarations; setup invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for package setup. The dynamic directory listing is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. It reads module files, constructs extension modules linking against 'GameplayKit', and specifies dependencies. No external input is processed, and no network activity occurs. The dynamic listing of modules is standard in such scripts. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is effectively 0, with minor variance in some reports justified by the standard practice of directory reading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The supply chain security posture is safe.",
