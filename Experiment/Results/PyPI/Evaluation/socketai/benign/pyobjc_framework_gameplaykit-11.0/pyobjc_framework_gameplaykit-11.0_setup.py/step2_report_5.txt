  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package that wraps a macOS framework using pyobjc.\n- It reads module files from a directory, constructs extension modules, and specifies dependencies.\n- No untrusted input processing, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues or malicious behavior are present.** The code performs typical package setup tasks with no suspicious elements.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **None identified.** All reports correctly describe the purpose and behavior of the script.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is more accurate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only minor point is the dynamic inclusion of modules via `os.listdir()`, which is standard in setup scripts, not malicious.\n\n### Consistency with the reports:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment. The only deviation is a security risk score of 0.1 in report 3, which seems unwarranted given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate setup script with no security issues. The scores should reflect that, with all being zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the exception of the minor security risk in report 3, which should be lowered to 0.\n- No further action is needed; the supply chain risk is negligible.",
