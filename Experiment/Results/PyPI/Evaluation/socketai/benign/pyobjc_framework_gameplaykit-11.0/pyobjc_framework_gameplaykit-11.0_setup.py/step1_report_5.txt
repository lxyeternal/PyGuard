{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure Python bindings (wrappers) for the macOS GameplayKit framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own file directory for modules, imports system modules os and sys, and reads the contents of the Modules directory to identify dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to sys.path, calls setup functions, and references module files, but no untrusted data or external commands are executed directly.",
  "flows": "Imports os and sys -> modifies sys.path -> defines setup configuration -> specifies module files and dependencies based on directory contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code dynamically includes modules based on directory listing, which is typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily prepares a Python package for distribution, including setting up extension modules linking against the GameplayKit framework. It dynamically lists module dependencies from the Modules directory, which is standard practice. No malicious functions, network communications, or credential handling are evident. No suspicious code or malware-like patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package that wraps a macOS framework. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. The code appears to serve its intended purpose for package setup.",
