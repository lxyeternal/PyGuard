  "purpose": "Unit testing code for GameplayKit's GKGraph class, specifically testing method argument types.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport and GameplayKit modules, method call self.assertArgIsBOOL.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> Call assertArgIsBOOL to verify argument type in a method.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard unit testing with no suspicious or unusual constructs, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support module and a gaming framework module, then defines a test class with a single test method. The test asserts that a specific method argument is a boolean. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external data handling. The code is straightforward and typical for a unit test.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a type check on a method argument in GameplayKit, with no suspicious elements.",
