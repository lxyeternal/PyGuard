  "purpose": "Verify that the second argument of GameplayKit.GKGraph.connectNodeToLowestCostNode_bidirectional_ is a boolean.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the method call self.assertArgIsBOOL with the method as argument.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs a static argument type check without data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> call assertArgIsBOOL on the method and argument index 1.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test verifying argument type correctness for a specific method in GameplayKit. It imports testing support modules, defines a test class, and asserts that the second argument of the method is a boolean. No external data, network, or file operations are involved. The code is clear, standard, and lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, justified by its role as a test script. No signs of supply chain attack, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test verifying argument types in a game development framework. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk approximately 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
