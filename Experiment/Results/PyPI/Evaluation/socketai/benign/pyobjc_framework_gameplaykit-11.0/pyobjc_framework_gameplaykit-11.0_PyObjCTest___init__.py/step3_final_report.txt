  "purpose": "The code is a placeholder comment indicating a test suite, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "There are no sources of input or data reads; the code contains only comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as the code is non-executable.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows exist due to the absence of executable statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely a comment with no obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment string with no executable code, data flow, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or security-related content. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1—are consistent with the minimal content. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the lack of logic or external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless placeholder comment with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk and no malware presence.",
