{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for validating schema correctness of various YAML data structures related to transform and bounding box definitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads YAML strings embedded within the test parameters; it converts YAML to ASDF format using helpers.yaml_to_asdf.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data input at runtime; it only tests YAML validation, so no sink leading to data leak or system impact exists.",
  "flows": "YAML data is transformed into ASDF buffer, then validation is performed via asdf.open, which raises validation errors on invalid schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies indicating malicious activity. The code strictly performs schema validation tests. No dynamic execution, network calls, or secret handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and a YAML helper to generate ASDF buffers from predefined YAML snippets. These snippets intentionally contain schema violations for testing purposes. The test function runs validation, expecting errors for malformed data, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No external data inputs, network activity, or secret handling observed. The code's purpose is purely for schema validation testing, not runtime data processing. It does not contain any suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of test cases designed to validate schema enforcement, with no malicious intent or behavior detected. It contains no security risks or malware. The code is safe and solely for validation purposes.",
