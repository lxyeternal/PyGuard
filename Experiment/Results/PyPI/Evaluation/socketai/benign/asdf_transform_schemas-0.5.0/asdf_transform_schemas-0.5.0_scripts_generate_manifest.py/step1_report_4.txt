  "purpose": "Generate transform manifests from a version_map YAML file for asdf-standard extensions, specifically for transform tags.",
  "sources": "Reads from the provided version_map_path YAML file; loads schemas via asdf.schema.load_schema(schema_uri).",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated manifest YAML to the specified output_path.",
  "flows": "Reads version_map from YAML file → constructs URIs and loads schemas via load_schema() → writes manifest YAML to output file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic schema loading through asdf.schema.load_schema with URIs constructed from version_map; no evident hardcoded secrets or backdoors; no suspicious code injections; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads a YAML file containing version mappings, constructs URIs, loads schemas via the asdf library, and outputs a new YAML manifest. It does not perform any network operations directly beyond what asdf.schema.load_schema might do internally. There are no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data. The code executes standard data processing and file I/O. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a legitimate utility script for manifest creation. The use of load_schema could involve network requests, but this is a standard library behavior and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs expected functions related to manifest creation with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It relies on the asdf library for schema loading, which is typical for such tools. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. Overall security risk is very low.",
