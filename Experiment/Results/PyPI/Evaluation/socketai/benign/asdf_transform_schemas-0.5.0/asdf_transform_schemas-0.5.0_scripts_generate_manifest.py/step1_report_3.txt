  "purpose": "Generate transform manifests from a version_map file for asdf-standard repository.",
  "sources": "Reads version_map_path file, reads schema URIs via asdf.schema.load_schema()",

  "flows": "Reads version_map_path, loads schemas via load_schema(), writes manifest YAML file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The script reads a YAML file specified by 'version_map_path' and processes schema URLs to build a manifest. It loads schemas dynamically via asdf.schema.load_schema(), which fetches schemas from remote URIs. The code appears to perform standard data processing without hidden or malicious code. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity are evident. The schema loading is part of expected functionality for schema validation or retrieval, not malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code’s purpose aligns with its functions, and there are no signs of malicious obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard script for generating a manifest from version data, with no malicious intent or behavior detected. It securely processes data and interacts with remote schemas as intended for its application.",
