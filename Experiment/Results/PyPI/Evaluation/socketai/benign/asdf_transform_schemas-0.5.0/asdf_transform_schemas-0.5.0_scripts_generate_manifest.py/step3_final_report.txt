  "purpose": "Generate transform manifests from a YAML version map, constructing schema URIs and loading schemas dynamically.",
  "sources": "Reads input YAML file (version_map_path), constructs schema URIs, loads schemas via asdf.schema.load_schema(schema_uri).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; remote schema loading occurs during schema.load_schema(), which could potentially fetch malicious schemas if sources are compromised.",
  "flows": "Reads version_map, constructs schema URIs, loads schemas from remote URLs, appends schema info to manifest, writes manifest YAML.",
  "anomalies": "Uses remote URLs for schema loading without validation; no input validation on paths; no secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that reads a version map, constructs schema URIs, loads schemas via network, and outputs a manifest. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The main security concern is reliance on external schemas, which could be compromised if the sources are malicious. All reports correctly identify this behavior as standard and not inherently malicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate given the context. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is found.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard utility for generating manifests with remote schema loading. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of external schema sources. No malicious intent or code is present. The current scores are justified and should be maintained, with awareness of the external dependency risk.",
