  "purpose": "Defines versioning information for the package, including version string and tuple.",
  "sources": "The version string assigned directly to __version__ and version variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows; the code only assigns static values.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version information; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version values are standard in package metadata files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical version declaration generated by setuptools_scm, with conditional typing support. It assigns static version values and sets up version variables for package use. No input reading, data processing, or external data handling occurs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as metadata for versioning purposes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
