  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and evaluate the findings, scores, and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, auto-generated versioning module created by setuptools_scm.\n- The code's purpose is solely to define static version variables, with no dynamic input, external data, or code execution.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- The code includes typical type-checking support via `TYPE_CHECKING`, which is common and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1:\n- **Purpose:** Version info for a Python package.\n- **Sources:** Hardcoded version string and tuple.\n- **Analysis:** Standard auto-generated code; no suspicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *malware:* 0 (correct)  \n- *obfuscated:* 0 (correct)  \n- *securityRisk:* 0 (correct)\n\n**Assessment:** Fully reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Static variables.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, straightforward version info.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *malware:* 0  \n- *obfuscated:* 0  \n- *securityRisk:* 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Version string assignment, type checking.\n- **Analysis:** Typical autogenerated code, no external input or dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *malware:* 0  \n- *obfuscated:* 0  \n- *securityRisk:* 0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 4:\n- **Purpose:** Version info for package.\n- **Sources:** Static assignment.\n- **Analysis:** Standard pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *malware:* 0  \n- *obfuscated:* 0  \n- *securityRisk:* 0\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 5:\n- **Purpose:** Version info, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- **Sources:** Hardcoded version data.\n- **Analysis:** Typical, no external data or code execution.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *malware:* 0  \n- *obfuscated:* 0  \n- *securityRisk:* 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign, auto-generated versioning module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.** The code is a standard, safe version info snippet with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- *malware:* 0  \n- *obfuscated:* 0  \n- *securityRisk:* 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
