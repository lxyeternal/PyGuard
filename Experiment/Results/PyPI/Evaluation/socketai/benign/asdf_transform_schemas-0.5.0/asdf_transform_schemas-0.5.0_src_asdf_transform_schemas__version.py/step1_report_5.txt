{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm, to track package version information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables, based on hardcoded version data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded version string is assigned directly to multiple variables; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and follows standard version declaration patterns. The use of type checking with TYPE_CHECKING is common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version of package metadata setup, with no dynamic or user-input-driven components. It uses standard Python idioms for version management. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, nor any suspicious data handling. It appears to be automatically generated by setuptools_scm, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define version information for the package. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
