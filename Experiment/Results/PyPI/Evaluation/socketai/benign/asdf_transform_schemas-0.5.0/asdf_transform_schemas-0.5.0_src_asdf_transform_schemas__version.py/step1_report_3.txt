  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, for tracking package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples; import statements within TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no external data input or output handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to output; static assignment of version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for type hints with a TYPE_CHECKING condition, then defines version variables accordingly. The actual version strings are hardcoded as '0.5.0'. The structure is typical for autogenerated version info, with no suspicious logic or external data interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. Its purpose is solely to define version info, and it does so securely.",
