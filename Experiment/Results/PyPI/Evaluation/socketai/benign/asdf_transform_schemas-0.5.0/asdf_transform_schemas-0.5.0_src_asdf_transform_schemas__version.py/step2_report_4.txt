  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code for potential issues.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module created by setuptools_scm.\n- It defines version variables (__version__, __version_tuple__, version, version_tuple) with hardcoded values ('0.5.0' and (0, 5, 0)).\n- Contains a conditional import for type checking, which is typical.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code appears to be a boilerplate versioning module with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration. The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is common for type hints without runtime overhead.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the lack of any security concern.\n\n### Potential Issues or Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as boilerplate version info.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code is standard, generated by setuptools_scm, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided and the code's benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is a typical, safe versioning snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
