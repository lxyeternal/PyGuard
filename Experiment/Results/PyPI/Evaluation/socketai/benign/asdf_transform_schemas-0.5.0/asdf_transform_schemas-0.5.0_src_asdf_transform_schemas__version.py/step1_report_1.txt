  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, primarily used for package version tracking.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and '__version_tuple__' are hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only sets static variables.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; variables are assigned static values.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional type checking logic, but nothing unusual or malicious; no secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard versioning module generated by setuptools_scm. It sets version variables and includes conditional logic for type checking, which is typical for type hinting purposes. No external input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, boilerplate versioning snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
