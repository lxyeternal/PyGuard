  "purpose": "Define static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string and tuple, conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; static variables are assigned without external input or dynamic code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module with static version variables and a type-checking conditional. It contains no dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. The code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, boilerplate version declaration snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
