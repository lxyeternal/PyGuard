  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and is used for version tracking and type checking.",
  "sources": "Variables defining version strings and tuples, specifically the assignment of version and version tuple values.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data inputs; the code simply assigns static version information.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples, with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The comment indicates auto-generation and version control safety, which is typical for version files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version file created by setuptools_scm. It includes a type-checking conditional import, static version string assignment, and version tuple definition. There are no inputs, external data, or suspicious behaviors. The code serves a standard purpose of defining package version info, with no malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for package version tracking, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
