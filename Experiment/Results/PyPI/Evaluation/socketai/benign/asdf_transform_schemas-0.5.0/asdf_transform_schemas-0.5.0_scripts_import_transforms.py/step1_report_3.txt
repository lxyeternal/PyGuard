  "purpose": "The script processes YAML schema files by updating identifiers, tags, references, and schema URLs to a new version and standardized format.",
  "sources": "Reads YAML files from the source directory specified as a command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed YAML files to the destination directory specified as a command-line argument.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> performs regex-based substitutions on content -> writes updated content to new files in the destination directory.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex substitutions for updating schema references and tags, but all substitutions are straightforward string replacements based on known patterns; no dynamic execution or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads YAML schema files, identifies schema identifiers and tags using regex patterns, and updates them to a new version and format. It also rewrites schema references to point to updated URIs. The script relies on file system operations and regex substitutions; no untrusted input is processed in a way that executes code or introduces malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the regex for internal and external references, but they are purely string pattern matching and replacement without code execution or network activity. There are no embedded payloads, no dynamic code evaluation, and no network communication in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs schema file updates through pattern replacements without executing external code or data. It appears to be a straightforward, safe utility for schema migration. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
