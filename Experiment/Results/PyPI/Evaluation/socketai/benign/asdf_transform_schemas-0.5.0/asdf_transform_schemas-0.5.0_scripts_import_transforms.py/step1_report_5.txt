{
  "purpose": "This script processes YAML schema files related to the asdf-standard, updating references and schema metadata for versioning and format consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads YAML files from a specified source directory; reads file contents for regex processing.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified YAML schema files to a destination directory.",
  "flows": "Reads schema files -> Applies regex substitutions to update references and metadata -> Writes updated files to destination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. Uses standard library functions and regex patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs filesystem operations to locate, process, and update YAML schema files based on patterns. It filters files to only process the latest version per schema name, modifies internal and external references, and updates schema identifiers and tags. The regex patterns used are for pattern matching in YAML content, not for executing code. The script writes output files safely with no indication of malicious activity or data exfiltration. No network operations, credential handling, or sensitive data processing is evident. The overall logic is straightforward, targeting schema version management without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for schema file management with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs controlled file I/O and string manipulations without any evidence of malicious intent.",
