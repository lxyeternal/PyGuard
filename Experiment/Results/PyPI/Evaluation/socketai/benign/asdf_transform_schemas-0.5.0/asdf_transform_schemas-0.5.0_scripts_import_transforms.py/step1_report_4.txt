{
  "purpose": "The script updates schema YAML files by modifying identifiers, tags, and references to prepare schemas for a new version and format.",
  "sources": "File paths from the source directory, reading YAML schema files, filename parsing for versioning.",
  "sinks": "Writing modified schema files to the destination directory.",
  "flows": "Reading schema files -> Modifying content via regex replacements -> Saving updated schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of regex for content transformation appears standard. No external network requests initiated by the script; it only rewrites local files. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads YAML schema files from a specified directory, identifies the latest version of each schema based on filename versions, and updates identifiers, tags, schemas, and references within each file. It uses regex patterns to perform these replacements, ensuring schemas conform to the new versioning scheme. The process involves reading files, processing their content, and writing them back, with no dynamic code execution or external communications. The script appears straightforward and intended solely for local file transformation, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard file processing utility for schema version updating, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not perform any network activity, system modification beyond file rewriting, or include suspicious code elements. Therefore, it is safe based on the provided code.",
