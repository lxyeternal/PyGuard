{
  "purpose": "The script updates YAML schema files by modifying IDs, tags, references, and schema metadata to a new version, facilitating schema version management.",
  "sources": "Reads input YAML files from the source directory, parses filenames for version info, and reads file contents for regex-based modifications.",
  "sinks": "Performs string replacements within file contents; no untrusted data sinks or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Source files are read; regex patterns identify and modify schema IDs, tags, references, and URIs; modified content is written to destination files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; regex patterns are straightforward; no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe file I/O and regex-based string modifications to update schema metadata and references. It identifies latest schema versions based on filename parsing, then updates IDs, tags, references, and schema URLs accordingly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The regex patterns are standard and used solely for pattern matching and substitution. The script's scope is limited to local file processing, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for schema file management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports are consistent, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1). It is safe for use in production environments.",
