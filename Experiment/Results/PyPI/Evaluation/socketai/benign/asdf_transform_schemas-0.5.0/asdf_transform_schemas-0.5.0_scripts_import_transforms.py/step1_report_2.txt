{
  "purpose": "The script processes YAML schema files, updating identifiers, tags, references, and URIs to a new schema version and format, facilitating schema transformation and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads YAML files from a specified source directory; reads file contents for parsing and modification.",
  "sinks": "Writes transformed YAML schema files to a specified destination directory.",
  "flows": "Reads schema files -> modifies ID, tag, references, and URIs -> writes updated schemas to output directory.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex-based substitutions for references and tags; no hardcoded credentials or hidden code observed; no dynamic code execution or network activity; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file processing and regex substitutions without executing untrusted code or performing network requests. It reads YAML schema files, updates identifiers and references, and outputs modified files. All operations are limited to file I/O and string manipulations. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external command execution. The regex patterns and file handling are standard for schema processing, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The script appears to serve a legitimate purpose of schema version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard schema processing script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs predictable file manipulations for schema version updates. No malicious or suspicious activity was detected.",
