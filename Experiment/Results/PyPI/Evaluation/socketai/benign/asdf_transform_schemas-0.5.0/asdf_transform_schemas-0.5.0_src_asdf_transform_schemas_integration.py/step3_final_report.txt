{
  "purpose": "The code locates and creates resource mappings for the 'asdf_transform_schemas' package resources, with fallback logic for development environments.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths constructed from package resource files or relative directory paths.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input, send data externally, or execute code beyond filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "Resource directory paths are constructed and checked; resource mappings are created from these paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports resource handling modules based on Python version, locates the 'resources' directory either within the package or via a relative path, raises an error if missing, and creates resource mappings for specific subdirectories. It performs standard filesystem and package resource handling with no external network activity or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The fallback logic and path handling are typical for resource management in Python packages, and no code execution or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward resource loader with no malicious intent or behavior. It performs standard filesystem and package resource handling safely, with fallback mechanisms suitable for development environments. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with its benign nature.",
