{
  "purpose": "The code aims to load resource directory mappings for the 'asdf_transform_schemas' package, facilitating access to schema resources either from package data or fallback directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'importlib_resources.files' function, the __file__ attribute for path resolution, and the filesystem directories specified by the paths.",
  "sinks": "The resource directory paths used in DirectoryResourceMapping may be used to access local files, but there are no sinks that transmit data externally or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, determining resource directory paths, and creating DirectoryResourceMapping objects based on these paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or backdoors are present. The code dynamically adjusts resource paths based on environment, which is normal for resource loading but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-dependent resource path resolution and constructs resource mappings using the 'DirectoryResourceMapping' class. It includes fallback logic for locating resource directories. No external network connections, code injection, or malicious activity are evident. Usage of importlib_resources and Path operations are standard. The only dynamic aspect is the path resolution, which is typical for resource loading. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource management routine for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It safely loads resources and constructs mappings, with fallback for development environments. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
