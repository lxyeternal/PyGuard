{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load resource mappings for the asdf_transform_schemas package, locating resource directories and defining mappings for schemas and manifests.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, importing modules (importlib_resources, asdf_standard, asdf_transform_schemas), accessing __file__ for directory paths.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to process or output untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and module files, then constructs paths to resource directories, which are used to create DirectoryResourceMapping objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The resource paths are constructed dynamically based on standard package structures; no obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports modules based on Python version, then attempts to locate a 'resources' directory either within the package or relative to the file path. It raises an error if the directory is missing. It then creates resource mappings for specific subdirectories. All operations involve standard library and well-known package functions, with no external data input or network activity. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate resource loader for a package, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It only performs filesystem checks and constructs resource mappings, which are safe operations.",
