{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically locates resource directories related to the 'asdf_transform_schemas' package and creates resource mappings for schema access.",
  "sources": "importlib_resources.files() to locate resource directories, Path(__file__).parent to locate parent directories",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or executed unsafely",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to critical operations; resource directory paths are constructed based on package files and filesystem",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Usage of filesystem paths and resource locating is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and imports the appropriate resource handling module. It then constructs the path to resources either from the package resources or, if not found, from a relative directory. The resource paths are used to create DirectoryResourceMapping objects. No external data is received, and no untrusted input is processed. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code's intent appears to be resource setup for schema management.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate resource setup for a package, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It manages resource directory paths safely and does not include any suspicious or harmful operations.",
