{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load resource mappings from specific directories, primarily for schema or resource management within a package.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem for directories ('resources', 'schemas', 'manifests') and uses importlib_resources to locate package data.",
  "sinks": "Uses directory paths and package resources; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reads package data via importlib_resources or filesystem paths; no untrusted data is processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code patterns; directory access is standard. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules based on Python version, then locates resource directories within the package or filesystem. It constructs resource mappings with specified URLs and directory paths. All operations are standard filesystem and package resource handling. No untrusted input handling, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical resource loading mechanism with no malicious intent or security concerns. It solely accesses package data and local directories for resource management.",
