{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to load resource mappings for the asdf_transform_schemas package, managing resource paths depending on the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads resource directories from the package filesystem and the local filesystem based on __file__.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system modification; the code mainly reads from filesystem and defines resource mappings.",
  "flows": "Resource directory paths are determined from package resources or fallback to local paths, then used to create DirectoryResourceMapping objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no obfuscated code. The logic appears straightforward and standard for resource loading.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version for compatibility, imports appropriate resource management modules, and defines a function to obtain resource mappings. It verifies existence of resource directories, with a fallback to local paths if necessary, and raises an error if resources are missing. The resource mappings are created with specified URL prefixes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard resource loader for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It manages resources carefully, with fallback mechanisms, and does not perform any dangerous operations.",
