  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration script with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The minor bug regarding '__file__' should be corrected for proper path resolution, but it does not pose a security risk. The overall security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), and malware and obfuscation scores are zero."
