  "purpose": "Expose the version string of the package/module",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version to get version data",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output to external sources",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code simply assigns and exports version information",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward version import and export",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a relative module '_version' and exposes it via __all__, which is a standard practice for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or data processing beyond the simple import and export of a version identifier.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal and standard version declaration module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
