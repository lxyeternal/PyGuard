  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is:\n     ```python\n     from ._version import version as __version__\n\n     __all__ = [\"__version__\"]\n     ```\n   - All reports confirm that this is a straightforward version import and export pattern.\n   - No untrusted data, no external data sinks, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, each emphasizing the benign and standard nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Note:** The reports are thorough and align well with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there is no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code is clearly non-malicious and safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware = 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they describe the code as standard.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard pattern for exposing a package version. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0",
