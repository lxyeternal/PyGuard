  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports describe the code as importing a `version` string from a local module `_version` and exposing it via `__all__`.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows common Python packaging patterns.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data leakage, network activity, or any other suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code matches the original code snippet exactly.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is simple, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware and Risk Justification**:\n   - Since the code only imports and exposes a version string from a local module, there is no basis for assigning any malware or security risk.\n   - The risk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Potential for Assumptions or Misinterpretation**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard version management.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n7. **Overall Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- Given the simplicity and the standard pattern of the code, there is no need to adjust the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a typical, benign version declaration snippet with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence presented.",
