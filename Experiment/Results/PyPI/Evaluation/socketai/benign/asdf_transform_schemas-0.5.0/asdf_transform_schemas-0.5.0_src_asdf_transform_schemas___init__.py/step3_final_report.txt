  "purpose": "To expose the package's version string for external access, facilitating version management and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Import from the local module '_version' where the 'version' string is defined.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output that could lead to leaks.",
  "flows": "Import of 'version' from '_version' module to '__version__' variable, then exposing '__version__' via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practices. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and exposes it for external modules. It does not involve any data input/output, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning high confidence (1), with no obfuscation or malware detected. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and standard pattern of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is solely to provide version information, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
