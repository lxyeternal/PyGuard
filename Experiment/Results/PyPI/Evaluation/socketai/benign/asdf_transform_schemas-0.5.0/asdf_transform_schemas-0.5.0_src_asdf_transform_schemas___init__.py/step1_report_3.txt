  "purpose": "Defines and exposes the package version for external access.",
  "sources": "Imports 'version' from a local module '_version'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "Imports data from a local module, then exposes it via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module '_version' and then exposes it in __all__. There are no suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or data leakage mechanisms. This is a typical version declaration module common in Python packages, serving to specify the version and control namespace exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a straightforward implementation for exposing the package version.",
