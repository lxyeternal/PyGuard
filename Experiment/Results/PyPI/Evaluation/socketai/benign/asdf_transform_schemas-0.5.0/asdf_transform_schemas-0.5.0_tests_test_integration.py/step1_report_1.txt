{
  "purpose": "The code loads YAML resources and manifests related to an ASDF schema, validating their contents and schemas against a resource manager and a predefined schema.",
  "sources": "Reads from YAML files located in 'resources' and nested subdirectories, and loads files via Path.open()",
  "sinks": "Uses 'yaml.safe_load()' to parse file contents and compares resource content with resource manager entries",
  "flows": "Reads YAML file data into memory, parses data with yaml.safe_load(), then compares loaded data with resource manager entries",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network calls, no obfuscated code, no unusual data handling or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads YAML files from specified directories, parses their contents with yaml.safe_load() which is safe in this context, and validates the data against schemas retrieved from a schema registry. It compares resource contents with entries in a resource manager. No external network activity, no code injection, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are evident. The code relies on standard libraries and straightforward file I/O and validation mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate resource validation script without malicious intent. It performs file loading, parsing, and schema validation securely without evident signs of malware or security risks.",
