  "purpose": "The code loads YAML resources and manifests, validates them against schemas, and checks resource manager references.",
  "sources": "File system reads: resource YAML files and manifest YAML files.",
  "sinks": "yaml.safe_load() parsing untrusted YAML content; resource_manager access (potential key lookup); assertions that compare resource content.",
  "flows": "File reads -> yaml.safe_load() -> resource_manager lookup -> validation and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.safe_load() without restricting tags could allow malicious YAML payloads. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed. No network or system commands executed. No obfuscated code detected. No obvious backdoors or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file system operations to load YAML files, parse them securely with yaml.safe_load(), and validate data against schemas. The resource_manager is used to verify resource contents. The validation relies on external schema loading. No network activity, code injection, or credential handling is present. The usage of yaml.safe_load() is standard, but untrusted YAML input could potentially be crafted maliciously, although such behavior is typical for configuration files. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious intent or malicious behavior. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malware are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard YAML file validation tasks with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate resource validation script, with typical use of YAML parsing and schema validation. No malware or supply chain attacks are evident.",
