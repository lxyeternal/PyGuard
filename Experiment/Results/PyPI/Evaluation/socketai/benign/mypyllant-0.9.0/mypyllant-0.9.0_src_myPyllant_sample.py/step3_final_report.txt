  "purpose": "Automates management of HVAC and hot water systems via the myPyllant API, performing temperature adjustments, holiday modes, and boosts.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for user credentials and configuration; API method calls for device control.",
  "sinks": "API calls to control devices; no data sinks or external network connections outside the API.",
  "flows": "Input credentials from command-line → API method invocations → device control actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured automation script for HVAC management. It uses standard API calls with credentials passed via CLI, which is typical but should be secured in production. No malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The API functions invoked are legitimate device management routines. The absence of obfuscation and malicious patterns indicates a benign purpose. The main security concern is credential handling via command-line arguments, which is common but should be managed securely. Overall, the code poses minimal security risks and shows no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate HVAC automation tool with no malicious intent or supply chain risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, primarily due to credential handling practices. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
