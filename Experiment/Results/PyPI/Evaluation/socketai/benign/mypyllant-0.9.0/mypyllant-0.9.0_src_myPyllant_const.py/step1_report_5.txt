  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and URLs for an authentication and API integration related to Vaillant Group services.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, URL templates, dictionary definitions, and default parameter values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external data sinks, or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code primarily sets static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static configuration constants for API endpoints, client identifiers, brand and country mappings, and default settings. URLs are constructed via string concatenation with placeholders but without dynamic input handling. No input validation or external data processing is present. No network activity or cryptographic operations are performed here. The code appears to serve as configuration data without malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely configuration with static data assignments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It does not contain any malware indicators or suspicious patterns.",
