  "purpose": "Define configuration constants, URLs, and static data for the application, including authentication URLs, API endpoints, client IDs, brands, and country mappings.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, dictionary definitions, and string concatenations.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No use of untrusted input, environment variables, or sensitive data handling in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no dynamic data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists of static definitions without dynamic or obfuscated components.",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes static configuration data such as URLs, brand and country mappings, and default values. String concatenations are simple and based on constants. There are no input operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The data appears to be intended for application configuration and is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static configuration data with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Overall, this code is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
