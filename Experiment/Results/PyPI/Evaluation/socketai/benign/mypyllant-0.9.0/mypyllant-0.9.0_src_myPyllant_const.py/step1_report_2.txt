    "TOKEN_URL",

  "sinks": [
    "URL templates such as LOGIN_URL, AUTHENTICATE_URL, TOKEN_URL",
    "Dictionary values used for API endpoints and identifiers"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Constant definitions -> URL template concatenation -> Usage in authentication flows",
    "Constants like CLIENT_ID, URL templates used in runtime authentication and API requests"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or tokens are present.",
    "URLs and identifiers are configured as static strings; no dynamic or user input is incorporated here.",
    "No suspicious or obfuscated code structures observed.",
    "The code primarily consists of static configuration data."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of configuration constants, URL templates, and static data dictionaries. It contains no input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, nor any data processing logic. The URL templates are used for API endpoints, with placeholders for dynamic parameters. The dictionaries for brands and countries are static mappings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this static configuration. The code does not read external input, execute code dynamically, or contain any secret information like credentials or tokens.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely configuration data for an API client, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions or contain any suspicious code segments.",
