  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and URLs for an API client related to the Vaillant Group's identity and service endpoints.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string URLs, dictionary definitions, and string constants.",
  "sinks": "No user input, external data, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Constants are assigned and used as configuration parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All code consists of static assignments and dictionary definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines constants, URLs, and static dictionaries for configuration purposes. There are no functions, no input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic execution. The URLs are hardcoded, which is typical for configuration files. No secrets like passwords or tokens are embedded. No code execution or external communication occurs within this snippet. It appears to be a straightforward configuration setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration setup defining URLs and constants for an API client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present. The code is safe and serves purely for configuration purposes.",
