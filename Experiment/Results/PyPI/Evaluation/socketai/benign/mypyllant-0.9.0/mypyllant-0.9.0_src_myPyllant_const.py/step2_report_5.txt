  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static configuration data, consisting of URL templates, dictionaries, and constants.\n- No dynamic input, user data, secrets, or code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- The URLs are hardcoded, which is typical for configuration files.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is static configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static configuration, no secrets, no dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, static constants and dictionaries, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Static configuration for URLs and constants, no dynamic or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Static configuration data, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code. Security risk=0 also makes sense. Obfuscated=0 is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n\n- **Any anomalies or overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward configuration data.\n\n- **Potential concerns?**  \n  None. No secrets, no dynamic code, no input handling, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at **0**, as the code is purely static configuration with no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.** There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive analysis that the code is safe, static configuration data.",
