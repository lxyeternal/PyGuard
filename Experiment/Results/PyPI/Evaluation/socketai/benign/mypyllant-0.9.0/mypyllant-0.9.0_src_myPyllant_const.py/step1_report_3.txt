  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration data for an authentication and API interaction system related to the Vaillant Group's services.",
  "sources": "String assignments for URLs, dictionary definitions for API endpoints, brand, country data, and default configuration values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; all data are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures. All data appear to be static configurations, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials (except non-sensitive identifiers), and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only constant definitions and dictionaries that serve as configuration parameters, URLs, and static data mappings. There are no functions, no input handling, no dynamic code execution, nor any data processing that could introduce vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets like passwords or API keys are present, and no malicious or suspicious code constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely configuration data with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any code that could be exploited or used maliciously. The data appears benign and intended for application configuration purposes.",
