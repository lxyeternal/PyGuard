  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining API URLs, constants, dictionaries for brands and countries, and default parameters for a Python application related to Vaillant Group services.",
  "sources": "String concatenations for URLs, static dictionaries, constants, and default parameter assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used directly without dynamic processing or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static configuration with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants, dictionaries, and default parameters. No dynamic code, input handling, secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. URLs are simple string templates with placeholders for runtime substitution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign configuration data, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately zero, as there are no malicious payloads or behaviors. The security risk score is zero, reflecting the static, safe nature of the code. The code does not contain any anomalies or suspicious patterns, and the structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and security risk at 0. No further action is necessary.",
