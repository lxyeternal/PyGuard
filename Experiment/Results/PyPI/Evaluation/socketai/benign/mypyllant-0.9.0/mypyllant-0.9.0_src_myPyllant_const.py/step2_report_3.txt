  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the static nature of the code, the absence of dynamic or untrusted input, and the lack of any suspicious or obfuscated constructs.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static configuration data: URL templates, constants, dictionaries for brands and countries, and default parameters. No functions, no input handling, no secrets, and no dynamic code execution are present. The URLs are constructed via simple string concatenation, and no malicious payloads or backdoors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  All reports agree that there are no issues in the code. The code is purely static configuration data with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or mistakes:**  \n  None are observed. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with no evident errors or flaws.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, transparent nature of the code.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified since there are no malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the static configuration nature and absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- No issues justify a risk score above 0.5 because there is no dynamic code, no secrets, and no suspicious activity.\n\n### Challenge assumptions:\n- The reports correctly assume that static configuration data without any dynamic or external input is safe.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the analysis remains purely factual.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is benign and purely configuration data.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall, this code poses no security threat.**",
