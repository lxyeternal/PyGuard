  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as static configuration data: URL templates, constants, dictionaries for brands and countries, and default values. No dynamic code, input handling, secrets, or obfuscated/malicious constructs are identified. Each report concludes that the code is benign and solely for configuration purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code. All reports agree on this.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected or claimed; malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation observed; obfuscated score is 0.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all are static configs.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No flaws or mistakes** are evident in the reports; they are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the static, transparent code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or executable components, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The absence of secrets, input handling, or malicious patterns supports this.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Potential false positives:** None; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Claims based on assumptions:** None; all observations are factual.\n- **Scores alignment:** Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the thorough static analysis and the unanimity of the reports, I concur with their evaluations.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a static configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and benign.",
