  "purpose": "Define various enumerations for a control system related to heating, cooling, and ventilation, with custom enum meta class support.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all enum values are hardcoded in class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; code only defines enum classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward enum class definitions with no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions extending str and Enum, with a custom metaclass for containment checks. No external input handling, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The custom enum metaclass adds convenience for 'in' checks but does not introduce security risks. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration module defining various system states and modes for a heating, ventilation, and control system. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain security attacks, or security risks.",
