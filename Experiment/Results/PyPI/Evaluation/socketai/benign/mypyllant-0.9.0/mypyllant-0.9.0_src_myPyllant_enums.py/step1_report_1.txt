{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations for device control and operational states in a home automation or HVAC system",
  "sources": "No direct external data sources or user input; all data are static enum definitions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output functions present; the code solely defines enums",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks, as the code contains only class definitions and no runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward enum definitions with no unusual constructs or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple enumerations using a custom EnumMeta class to enable containment checks. The enums serve as constants for device states and control modes. There are no functions or logic that process untrusted data, no input/output operations, no network connections, or data leaks. The only notable feature is a custom __contains__ method, which is not suspicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of enum definitions used for device state representation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It appears to be a benign part of a larger system, focusing on data representation.",
