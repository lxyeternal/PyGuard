  "purpose": "Define custom Enum classes with additional properties and meta-programming behavior for type checking and string representations.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output points or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to critical sinks; primarily static class and property definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior. The comment in VentilationOperationModeVRC700 indicates uncertainty but no malicious activity. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple Enum classes with custom string and property methods, using a custom metaclass for __contains__ checks. No external data inputs, network communications, or file operations are present. The class structure is straightforward and typical for organizing constant values. The comment in VentilationOperationModeVRC700 suggests uncertainty about the meaning of some modes but does not imply malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of Enum definitions intended for use as constants and property accessors. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
