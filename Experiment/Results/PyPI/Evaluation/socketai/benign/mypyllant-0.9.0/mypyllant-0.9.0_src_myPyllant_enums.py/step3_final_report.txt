  "purpose": "Defines various enumerations representing device states, control modes, and functions for HVAC and related systems.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions, including class attributes and property methods",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, output, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "N/A; static enum definitions without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard enum pattern with a custom __contains__ method, which is benign",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum classes used for representing system states and control modes. The custom EnumMeta class adds a __contains__ method, which is a common pattern to facilitate 'in' checks. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Comments indicate some uncertainty but do not imply malicious intent. The code is well-structured, static, and intended for configuration or state representation. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of enum definitions for device and system states with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
