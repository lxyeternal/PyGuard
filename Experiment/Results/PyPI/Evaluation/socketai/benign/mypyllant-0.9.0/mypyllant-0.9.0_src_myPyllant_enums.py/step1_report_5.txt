{
  "purpose": "The code defines several Enum classes with custom behavior for a smart control system, primarily for managing device states and modes.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and property methods, specifically the __contains__ method in MyPyllantEnumMeta, and string properties in Enum classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no external data outputs or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from external sources to sinks; code mainly defines enums and properties without data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable custom behavior is the __contains__ method override, which is standard for Enum classes and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum class definitions for various control modes and states, utilizing a custom metaclass to enhance Enum functionality. It includes properties for display and comparison but lacks any data input/output handling, network interactions, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious logic. The __contains__ method is a common pattern to check membership in enums, and the string properties provide user-friendly labels. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and intended for configuration or state representation without any suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of enumeration classes used for system control states and modes. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger control or management system, with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
