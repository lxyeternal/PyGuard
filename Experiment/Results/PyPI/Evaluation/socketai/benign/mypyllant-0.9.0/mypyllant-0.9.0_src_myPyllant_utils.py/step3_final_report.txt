  "purpose": "Utility functions for data transformation, cryptographic code generation, date formatting/parsing, argument parsing, and data comparison.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions, internal data structures, standard library functions (e.g., random, hashlib, base64, re, datetime). No external data sources or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions process data internally without writing to external systems or exposing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions, with cryptographic functions generating secure tokens, date functions parsing and formatting timestamps, and data transformation functions converting case styles.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries, proper cryptographic practices, and straightforward logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions for string case conversion, cryptographic code generation, date parsing/formatting, argument parsing, and data comparison. It employs secure practices (e.g., SystemRandom, SHA-256), avoids external network activity, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The functions are standard, well-structured, and do not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The cryptographic functions are correctly implemented, and the overall code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard utility functions with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the cryptographic practices but overall safe. The assessments in the provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code.",
