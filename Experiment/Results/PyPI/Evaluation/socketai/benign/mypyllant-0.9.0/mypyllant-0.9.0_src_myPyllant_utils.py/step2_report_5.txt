  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data transformation, code generation, date formatting/parsing, argument parsing. No suspicious or malicious code observed.\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, no network or file I/O, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues found. The high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, cryptographic code generation, date handling, argument parsing. No external input reading or suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Use of `random.SystemRandom()`, SHA-256 hashing, base64 encoding, all standard. No network activity or secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The slight security risk score (0.2) is acceptable considering the cryptographic functions, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, random string and code generation, date parsing/formatting, argument parsing. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Findings:** Proper use of cryptographic practices, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the security risk is minimal and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data transformation, cryptographic code generation, date handling, configuration. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** Use of `SystemRandom`, SHA-256, base64, no network or file I/O, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data conversion, cryptographic code generation, date parsing, configuration. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Secure random, hashing, encoding, no external data fetch, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports, justified by the cryptographic functions, but no actual vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a collection of utility functions, standard in nature.\n- No network activity, secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- Use of cryptographic functions and randomness is appropriate and standard.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the cryptographic and randomness functions, but overall low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the detailed analysis.",
