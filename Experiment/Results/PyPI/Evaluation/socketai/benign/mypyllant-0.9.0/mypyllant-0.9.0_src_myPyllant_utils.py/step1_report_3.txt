  "purpose": "Utility functions for data transformation, random string and code generation, date formatting/parsing, and argument parsing for a myVaillant-related application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'random', 'hashlib', 'base64', and 'argparse'. Data inputs come from function parameters, user input via argparse, and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable functions include 'generate_code' (uses random and hashing), 'random_string', 'datetime_parse', 'datetime_format', and argument parsing. No direct untrusted data sinks like network calls or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "User input (via argparse or function parameters) flows into functions like 'prepare_field_value_for_dict' and 'generate_code'. Generated or transformed data (e.g., code_verifier, code_challenge) could be used in authentication flows, but no network transmission is shown within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. Use of 'random' module in 'generate_code' and 'random_string' is standard for non-cryptographic purposes; 'SystemRandom' is appropriate for cryptographic use. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. No secret keys or secrets are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for string conversion, secure code generation, date formatting/parsing, and argument parsing. Functions like 'generate_code' use cryptographically secure random sources ('SystemRandom') and proper hashing with SHA-256, which is standard. No indications of malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The use of 'prepare_field_value_for_dict' for data transformation appears benign. Argument parsing is standard for CLI tools. The recursive comparison function is for debugging or testing purposes and is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data handling and CLI argument parsing. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity. It is a typical supporting module for an application dealing with date/time, string encoding, and argument management.",
