  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard utility functions with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the cryptographic practices but overall safe. The assessments in the provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code."
