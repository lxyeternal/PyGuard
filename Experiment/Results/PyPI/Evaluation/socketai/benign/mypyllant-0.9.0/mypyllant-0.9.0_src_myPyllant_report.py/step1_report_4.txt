  "purpose": "Export data from myVaillant API, retrieving yearly reports for systems.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, especially API credentials and report parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writing report content to files and printing status messages to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user, password, brand, year, country) are used to initialize API; API fetches system data and reports; report contents are written to files or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward API interactions.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers user input via argparse, with options for API credentials, report year, and verbosity. It asynchronously interacts with the MyPyllantAPI, retrieving system reports and saving them to files or returning results. There are no signs of obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious data handling. The API usage appears legitimate and confined to report retrieval. No hardcoded secrets are detected; credentials are expected from user input. The code relies on external API classes and methods, which are presumed to be secure and standard. The only potentially risky behavior is writing report files, but this is consistent with the tool's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data export tool for the myVaillant API with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows standard practices for user input, asynchronous API communication, and file handling. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
