{
  "purpose": "The script exports data from the myVaillant API by retrieving system reports for a specified year and optionally saving them to files.",
  "sources": "User inputs from command-line arguments: --year, --verbose; API methods: MyPyllantAPI initialization, get_systems(), get_yearly_reports(); Report data via report.file_name and report.file_content.",
  "sinks": "Writing report.file_content to files; outputting status messages to stdout.",
  "flows": "User input args -> API calls (get_systems, get_yearly_reports) -> report.file_content -> file write; report.file_name -> file creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present; code performs standard API data export.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and well-defined API methods to fetch and store reports. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious behavior, or malicious code injection are present. It handles file operations straightforwardly, with no obfuscated or unusual code constructs. The script relies on external API modules (myPyllant.api), which are assumed to be legitimate. There is no indication of data leakage beyond expected report storage. The overall flow is typical for data export tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data export script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It securely handles input parameters and performs standard API data retrieval and file writing without evident security risks.",
