  "purpose": "This script exports data from the myVaillant API by retrieving system reports for a specified year and saving them to files or returning them as results.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (--year, --verbose), API calls to MyPyllantAPI (get_systems, get_yearly_reports), report file content",
  "sinks": "File system writes of report files, standard output messages",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> API system retrieval -> report generation -> file writing or return results",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous data retrieval and export utility. It uses standard libraries and external API calls without any obfuscation or malicious activity. The report writing is direct, with no evident data leakage or code injection. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the external API is assumed to be legitimate. The code's operations are typical for such data export scripts, and no vulnerabilities are apparent within this scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe data export utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
