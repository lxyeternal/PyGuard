  "purpose": "Export data from myVaillant API related to systems and reports for a specified year.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command line arguments (user, password, brand, country, year); API method calls to retrieve systems and reports.",
  "sinks": "Writing report content to files on disk; potential output to stdout.",
  "flows": "User input via CLI -> API calls to fetch reports -> writing report content to files or returning data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. Use of asynchronous context managers and file operations are standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts user credentials and configuration via command line, uses an external API class 'MyPyllantAPI' to retrieve systems and reports asynchronously, and writes report contents to files. The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The operations involve standard data retrieval and file writing. Logging setup is conditional on a verbose flag but does not contain sensitive information. Overall, the code implements a data export routine without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data retrieval and export script utilizing an external API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe with respect to supply chain threats. However, the security of the API and environment depends on external factors not covered here.",
