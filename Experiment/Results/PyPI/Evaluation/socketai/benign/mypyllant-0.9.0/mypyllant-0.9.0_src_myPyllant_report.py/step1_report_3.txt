{
  "purpose": "The script exports data from the myVaillant API, fetching yearly reports for systems and writing them to files or returning them.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (user, password, brand, year, country), and data fetched from the MyPyllantAPI methods.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations where report.file_content is written to disk; potential exposure if content contains sensitive data. Also, standard output logging.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> API fetches report data -> File writes/report output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network connections or obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution or unusual variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a data export utility interfacing with an external API using provided credentials and parameters. It performs async data retrieval, iterates over systems and reports, and writes report contents to files. No embedded or hidden malicious behaviors are detected. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or credential theft mechanisms are present. The use of API calls and file I/O appears legitimate, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The structure is straightforward, and all functions perform expected operations based on inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate data export tool with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles inputs and performs standard file and API operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or security threats are detected.",
