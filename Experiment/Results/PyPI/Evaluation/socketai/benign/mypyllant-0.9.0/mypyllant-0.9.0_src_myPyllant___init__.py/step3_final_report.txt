  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, performs network requests, executes system commands, loads external data, uses dynamic execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration via network, system command execution, dynamic code evaluation, access to environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, untrusted input) to sinks (network, system commands, eval/exec).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic execution (eval/exec), suspicious network references, inconsistent variable naming, obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with suspicious network activity and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. No clear benign patterns are observed. The code's structure suggests possible backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of eval/exec and external domains increases the likelihood of malicious behavior. The code's suspicious features outweigh benign indicators, warranting a high malware and security risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity associated with exfiltration or backdoors. The risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. Further investigation and code review are strongly recommended before deployment.",
