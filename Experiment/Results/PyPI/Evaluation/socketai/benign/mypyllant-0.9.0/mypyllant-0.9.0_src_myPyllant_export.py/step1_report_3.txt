{
  "purpose": "This script interacts with the myPyllant API to export device data, either system information or historical data, based on user-specified parameters.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments: --data, --resolution, --start, --end, --verbose; API calls to myPyllant API methods.",
  "sinks": "Data processing functions that prepare dictionaries for output; sys.stdout for printing JSON results.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> command-line args -> API calls -> data processing -> JSON serialization to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of API credentials is externalized (passed as parameters), not embedded. No unusual or unexpected code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly imports necessary modules, defines argument parsing, and contains an async main function that retrieves system and device data from the API. The prepare_data function removes the 'device' key, indicating no sensitive info is mishandled. The API interaction appears standard with no signs of malicious data exfiltration or backdoors. No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code structure is typical for an API data exporter with no malicious intent or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate data export utility with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It securely processes data and outputs JSON. There are no indications of sabotage or malicious activity.",
