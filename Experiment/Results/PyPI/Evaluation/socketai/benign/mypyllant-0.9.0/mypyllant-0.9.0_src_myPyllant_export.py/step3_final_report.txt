  "purpose": "CLI utility for exporting data from myPyllant API, including system and device data, with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for start/end dates, resolution, data flags; external API modules for data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Outputting JSON data to stdout; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed -> API calls based on parameters -> Data processed in prepare_data -> JSON dumped to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that interacts with external API modules to export system and device data. It uses standard libraries and async API calls, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. Credentials are passed as parameters, and data is outputted as JSON, which is typical for such utilities. External modules are assumed legitimate; no network activity beyond API calls is observed. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data export utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to external dependencies. No improvements are necessary based on this review.",
