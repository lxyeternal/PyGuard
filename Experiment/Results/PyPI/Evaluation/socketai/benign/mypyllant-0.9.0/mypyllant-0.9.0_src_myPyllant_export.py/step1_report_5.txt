{
  "purpose": "The script exports device data from the myPyllant API, either as raw data or system info, based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments for start/end dates, resolution, and flags; data fetched from the myPyllant API within async functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing JSON output to stdout, and API calls which could transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> argument parsing -> API calls (get_systems, get_data_by_device) -> data processing (prepare_data) -> JSON serialization to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. Usage of API and data processing appears standard. No hidden network activity or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles exporting device data via a well-structured API with standard async patterns. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible; API interactions seem normal. Data is processed and then output as JSON. No suspicious command execution, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on external API and modules which are assumed to be legitimate. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data export utility interfacing with a specific API, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The overall security risk is very low.",
