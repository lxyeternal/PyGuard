It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects the potential for sensitive data exposure via logs, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."

The risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. Further investigation and code review are strongly recommended before deployment."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, primarily due to credential handling practices. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the cryptographic practices but overall safe. The assessments in the provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code."
