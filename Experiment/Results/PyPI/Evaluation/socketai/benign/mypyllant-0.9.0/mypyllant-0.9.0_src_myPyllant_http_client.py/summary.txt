  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard async HTTP client utility designed for debugging and request monitoring. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects the potential for sensitive data exposure via logs, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."
