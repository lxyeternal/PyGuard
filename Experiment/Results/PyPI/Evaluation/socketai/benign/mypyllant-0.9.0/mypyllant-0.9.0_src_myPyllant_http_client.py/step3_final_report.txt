  "purpose": "A wrapper around aiohttp.ClientSession that adds request counting, detailed tracing, and error handling for debugging and monitoring HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Request initiation, request chunks sent, response headers, response content, error responses",
  "sinks": "Response content processing (json/text), error handling (raising exceptions with response text)",
  "flows": "Request start -> request chunk sent -> request end -> response content or error",
  "anomalies": "Potential logging of response content which could expose sensitive data, but this is standard debugging practice",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom aiohttp ClientSession subclass with request counting and detailed tracing callbacks. The tracing functions log request start, chunks sent, and response content based on content type. Error handling augments 400 responses with response text. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The logging of response content could leak sensitive data if used improperly, but this is typical in debugging contexts. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (0.1-0.2) due to potential data leakage in logs, which is a common debugging concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard async HTTP client utility designed for debugging and request monitoring. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects the potential for sensitive data exposure via logs, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
