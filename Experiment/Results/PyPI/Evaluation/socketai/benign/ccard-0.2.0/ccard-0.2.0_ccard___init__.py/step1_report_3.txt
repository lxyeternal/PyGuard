  "purpose": "Generate credit card numbers by reading from predefined files for different card types.",
  "sources": "Reading from file paths specified in the FILES dictionary, specifically 'visa', 'discover', 'mastercard', 'americanexpress'.",
  "sinks": "Returning integers parsed from file lines, no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "get_number reads a file, selects a line based on a random threshold, converts it to int, and returns it.",
  "anomalies": "Uses random.random() * 30000 for line selection, which is inefficient and potentially unsafe if the files are maliciously crafted. No validation of file contents or format. No evident malicious code or backdoors. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads card number data from local files and selects a line based on a random float multiplied by 30000, then returns that line as an integer. It does not include any external network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The only potential concern is the method of random line selection which could be manipulated if the files are maliciously crafted, but this is not inherently malicious. No malware or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward generator for credit card numbers based on local files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple credit card number generator that reads from local files. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware characteristics. No security risks are evident beyond potential misuse if the input files are maliciously crafted, but this is not malicious code itself. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
