  "purpose": "Generate credit card numbers by reading from local files for each card type.",
  "sources": "Files: 'visa', 'discover', 'mastercard', 'americanexpress' located relative to the script directory.",
  "sinks": "None; code only reads local files and returns lines as integers.",
  "flows": "random.random() * 30000 determines an index; sequentially reads lines until index is surpassed; returns line as number.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a non-uniform, inefficient random selection method; returns empty string if no lines are found; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads from local files containing credit card numbers, selecting a line based on a flawed random index calculation. The method is inefficient and may produce biased results but does not involve any malicious activity or external data exfiltration. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The main concern is the random selection approach, which could be improved for correctness, but it does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating credit card numbers from local files. No malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation is present. The low security risk score reflects the inefficiency in random line selection, not a security threat.",
