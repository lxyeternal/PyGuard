  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'ccard' package, including metadata, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CONTRIBUTING.rst' files for long description; importing package metadata from 'ccard' module.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or sensitive data exposure points.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> importing package metadata -> passing data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The 'ccard' module's attributes are used for package metadata, assuming they are static attributes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a module named 'ccard' and uses its attributes to populate setup parameters, such as name, version, author, and URL. It reads README and CONTRIBUTING files for descriptions. The setup() function configures package metadata, package data, entry points, and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior like network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution beyond package setup. No suspicious or obfuscated code is present. All operations are standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply gathers package metadata and configuration details for distribution.",
