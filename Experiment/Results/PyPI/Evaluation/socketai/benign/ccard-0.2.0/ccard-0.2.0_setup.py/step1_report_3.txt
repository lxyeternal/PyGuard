  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'ccard' Python package, including metadata, package data, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CONTRIBUTING.rst' files; importing 'ccard' module for metadata attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Read files to obtain package description and metadata; use imported 'ccard' attributes to populate setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports a module 'ccard' to obtain package metadata dynamically, reads description files, and calls 'setup()' to configure package installation. The 'ccard' module is expected to provide all metadata attributes such as '__name__', '__title__', etc. No external inputs, untrusted data, or risky operations are present. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is apparent. The package configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, utilizing module attributes for metadata. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The package appears safe based on this code.",
