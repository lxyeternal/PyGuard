  "purpose": "Standard package setup script for the 'ccard' Python module, configuring metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst', 'CONTRIBUTING.rst', and imports 'ccard' module attributes for metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or file output beyond standard setup files.",
  "flows": "Static attribute access from 'ccard' to setup() parameters; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script relying on trusted static attributes from 'ccard'. It reads description files and configures package metadata without any dynamic or malicious behavior. No external data fetching, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The 'package_data' and 'entry_points' are standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
