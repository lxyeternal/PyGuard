  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package named 'ccard', including reading metadata and configuring installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'README.rst' and 'CONTRIBUTING.rst' files for long descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "File reads (sources) used solely for documentation purposes, with data stored in variables for setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses attributes from 'ccard' module for package metadata; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a package 'ccard' and uses its attributes to populate setup parameters. It reads description files for documentation. The setup() call configures package metadata, entry points, classifiers, and testing suite. No suspicious code, no external data fetching, nor any execution of untrusted input. The package data includes 'dist.*', which is standard for packaging distribution files. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and there are no security concerns based on this code fragment.",
