{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'ccard'.",
  "sources": "Reads version, author, email, link, info from the 'ccard' module; reads README and CONTRIBUTING files.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external output besides standard package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads module attributes, combines README and contributing files for long description, then passes data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code relies entirely on attributes imported from 'ccard' without validation; no apparent malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'ccard' module and extracts metadata attributes such as name, version, author, and link. It reads README and CONTRIBUTING files for descriptive content, then uses setuptools.setup() to package the project, specifying package data, entry points, classifiers, and test suite. The code does not process untrusted input or execute dynamic code. It assumes 'ccard' module provides trusted metadata. There are no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious commands present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and distribution parameters based on trusted module attributes.",
