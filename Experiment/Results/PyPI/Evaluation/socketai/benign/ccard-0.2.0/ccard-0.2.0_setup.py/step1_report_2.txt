  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'ccard' Python package, used to define package metadata and install instructions.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from the 'ccard' module, 'README.rst', and 'CONTRIBUTING.rst' files.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output present.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files to populate setup parameters; no untrusted data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code straightforwardly configures package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'ccard' to extract package metadata such as name, version, author, etc. It reads README and contributing files for description. The setup() function uses this data to define the package's install and distribution parameters, including entry points for console scripts. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network interactions are present. The code is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply configures package metadata and entry points without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
