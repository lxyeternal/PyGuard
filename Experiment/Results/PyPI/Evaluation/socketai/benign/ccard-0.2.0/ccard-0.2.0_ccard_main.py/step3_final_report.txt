{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module 'ccard' and calls its 'visa()' function, printing the result.",
  "sources": "The call to 'visa()' function within the 'ccard' module.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'visa()' printed to standard output; potential data exfiltration if 'visa()' returns sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'visa()' function in 'ccard' to the print statement, then to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "None in the visible code; reliance on an external, non-standard module 'ccard' with unknown behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The primary concern is the behavior of the external 'ccard' module and its 'visa()' function, which are unspecified. Given the lack of evidence, the code itself appears benign. However, the external dependency could potentially handle sensitive data or perform malicious actions, warranting cautious scoring. The scores should reflect the uncertainty and potential risk associated with the external module. Considering the possibility of malicious behavior, the malware score is set to 0.6, the obfuscated score remains 0, and the security risk score is also 0.6, indicating moderate concern due to external dependency. Further review of 'ccard' is recommended before deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and straightforward; the main risk stems from the external 'ccard' module, which could be malicious or handle sensitive data. The current scores appropriately reflect this uncertainty, but further investigation into 'ccard' is advised.",
