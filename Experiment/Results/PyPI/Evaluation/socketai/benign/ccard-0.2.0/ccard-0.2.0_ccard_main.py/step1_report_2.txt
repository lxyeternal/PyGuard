{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module 'ccard' and its 'visa' function, then prints the result of calling 'visa()'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/output via the 'visa()' function call and the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs data that could potentially be sensitive if 'visa()' returns sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input data is indirectly obtained through the 'visa()' function; the output from 'visa()' flows directly to the console via 'print'.",
  "anomalies": "The source 'ccard' module and its 'visa' function are not standard libraries; their behavior is unknown. No explicit hardcoded secrets are visible. The code is minimal and simple, but the imported module and its function's behavior are uncertain.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a potentially custom module 'ccard' and calls its 'visa' function, printing its return value. There are no visible malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. However, since the functionality of 'ccard' and 'visa' is unknown, there is uncertainty about what data is retrieved or processed. The code itself does not contain malicious logic or obfuscation, but its security implications depend on the behavior of the imported 'visa' function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not exhibit obvious malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its security risk level is low based on the visible code, but reliance on an unknown external module 'ccard' and its 'visa' function warrants caution. Further review of the 'ccard' module is recommended.",
