{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module 'ccard' and calls its 'visa' function, printing the result.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'ccard' module via the 'visa' function.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'visa()' is printed, which could potentially be malicious if it contains sensitive data or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'visa' function (source) to the 'print' statement (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The module 'ccard' and its 'visa' function are non-standard and unspecified; usage of such a module raises suspicion. The code is minimal and does not include explicit security checks or validations.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it imports a possibly custom or third-party module 'ccard', then calls its 'visa' function, printing the returned value. There is no indication of input validation, no hardcoded secrets, and no complex logic. The critical concern is the nature of the 'ccard' module and its 'visa' function, which could potentially return sensitive or malicious data. Given only this code, the main risk stems from the unknown behavior of 'ccard.visa()'. The code itself is simple, with no obfuscation or malicious indicators evident in the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is reliance on an external 'ccard' module, whose behavior is unknown. The structure itself appears benign but warrants investigation into what 'ccard.visa()' does, as it could potentially be malicious or leak sensitive data.",
