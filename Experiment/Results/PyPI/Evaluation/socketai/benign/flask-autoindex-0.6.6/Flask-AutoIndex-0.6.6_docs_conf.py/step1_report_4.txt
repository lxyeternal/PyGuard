  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "None observed; static configuration data is used internally without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. All code appears standard for a documentation configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration file for Sphinx, containing project info, extension lists, path settings, and HTML output options. All code is static, commented, and typical for such setup files. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data interaction is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It follows standard patterns without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
