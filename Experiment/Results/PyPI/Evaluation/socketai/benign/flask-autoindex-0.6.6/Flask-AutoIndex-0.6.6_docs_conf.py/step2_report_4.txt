  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Behavior**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation. There are no dynamic elements, no external data processing, no code execution, and no network calls. The code is straightforward and contains only configuration parameters, comments, and static lists/strings.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Malware Score**:  \n   The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports. Given the code's static nature and absence of any suspicious or malicious code snippets, this assessment appears accurate. There are no signs of embedded malware, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Anomalies**:  \n   All reports correctly note that the code is not obfuscated and follows standard patterns. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n4. **Security Risks & Data Flows**:  \n   The reports assert no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no external data, no secrets, and no potential for data leaks or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Scores & Reasoning**:  \n   - The confidence score of 1 is appropriate, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified; no security issues are present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n\n6. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are consistent and reasonable. They base their conclusions on the static, benign nature of the code. No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made, and none are justified given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence. The code is a typical, benign configuration file with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
