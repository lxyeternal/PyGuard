  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder, setting project info, paths, themes, and extensions without any dynamic or external code execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static variables and comments; no external inputs or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured configuration file with no dynamic elements, external data, or code execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The high confidence scores are justified given the static and transparent nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
