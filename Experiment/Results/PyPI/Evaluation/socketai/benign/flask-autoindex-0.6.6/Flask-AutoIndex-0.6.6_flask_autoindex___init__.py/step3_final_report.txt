{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Flask extension for directory autoindexing, serving directory listings and static files with customizable icons and sorting options.",
  "sources": "URL path parameters, request.args for sorting, filesystem paths via os.path.join, user-defined functions for icon rules.",
  "sinks": "render_template for HTML pages, send_file for files, abort for error responses.",
  "flows": "User input from URL and query parameters influences filesystem access and template rendering, with validation to prevent directory traversal.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity detected. Path validation via relpath prevents directory traversal.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Flask practices for route registration, filesystem access, and template rendering. It includes path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The use of request.args for sorting is typical and secure. The code's logic aligns with a legitimate directory listing extension, with security measures in place. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Flask extension for directory autoindexing, with appropriate security checks and no malicious intent. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified given its functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
