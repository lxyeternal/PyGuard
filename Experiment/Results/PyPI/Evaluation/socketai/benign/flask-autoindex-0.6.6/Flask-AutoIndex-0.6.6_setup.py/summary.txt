  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score in the reports (0.1) is justified by the use of __doc__, but this is a negligible concern. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero. No modifications are necessary."
