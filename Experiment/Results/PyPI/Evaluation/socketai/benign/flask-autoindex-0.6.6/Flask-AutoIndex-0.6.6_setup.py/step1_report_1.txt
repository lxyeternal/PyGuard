{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the Flask-AutoIndex Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and testing.",
  "sources": "Input data from package metadata, import statements, and the __doc__ string.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure if user input influenced the setup parameters (none evident here), or if the package data paths are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script primarily sets package metadata and configuration, with no runtime data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present. The code strictly adheres to standard setup.py patterns. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 're' and 'setuptools', defines a simple test runner, and calls 'setup()' with static, trusted package metadata. There are no functions, user inputs, or external data processing. No malicious or suspicious patterns such as code injection, environment variable misuse, or network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and consistent with common Python package distribution practices.",
