  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious code.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate, as no malware is present.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, since the script performs only package configuration with no security implications.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the script is standard package setup code with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, correctly states that the script is a typical setup configuration.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also correct that the script is a standard setup script.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly higher, but still very low; it accounts for the use of `__doc__` and setup configuration, which are benign.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n**Note:** The slight increase in securityRisk score (0.1) is acceptable, given the use of `__doc__`, but it's not indicative of malicious activity.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, benign setup.py script with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are all 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the low security concern.\n- Obfuscation is correctly marked as 0 in all cases.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code in question is a typical package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks exists.\n- The slightly elevated securityRisk score in report 5 (0.1) is justified but still indicates minimal concern.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard package setup with no security issues.\n\n**In conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, and no changes are necessary.",
