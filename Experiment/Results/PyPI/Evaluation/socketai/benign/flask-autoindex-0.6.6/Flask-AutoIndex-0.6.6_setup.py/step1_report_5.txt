{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the Flask-AutoIndex package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's docstring (__doc__) for long_description, and gathers package data and dependencies specified within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed in a harmful manner. The only potential concern is reading __doc__ and defining entry points.",
  "flows": "The docstring is used as long_description; package data is specified statically; entry points set up command-line scripts. No dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic are present. The script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports re and setuptools, defines a run_tests() function importing from tests, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The use of __doc__ for long_description is standard. There are no indications of malicious code, dynamic execution, or data leaks. The setup script appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It is safe and standard in practice.",
