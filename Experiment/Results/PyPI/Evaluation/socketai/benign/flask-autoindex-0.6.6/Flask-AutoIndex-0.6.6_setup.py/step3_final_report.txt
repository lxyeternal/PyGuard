  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and test configuration.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, __doc__ for long_description, setup() parameters, entry_points, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration data used solely for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unnecessary import of 're' module; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The import of 're' is unused but harmless. The entry point defines a CLI command that runs the application, which is standard. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The use of __doc__ for long_description is benign. The overall structure and content are straightforward and consistent with safe package distribution practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score in the reports (0.1) is justified by the use of __doc__, but this is a negligible concern. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero. No modifications are necessary.",
