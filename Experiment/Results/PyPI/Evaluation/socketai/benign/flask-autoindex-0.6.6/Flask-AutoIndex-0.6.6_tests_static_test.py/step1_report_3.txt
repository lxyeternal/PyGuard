{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing and possibly communicate with an external server.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs include network requests, file writes, or print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network transmission or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data manipulation tasks with standard library functions. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation, are present. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not suggest sabotage. The flow of data seems straightforward and intended. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected at the source, processing, or sink stages.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not show any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign implementation. However, due to limited context and only analyzing this snippet, a low-confidence assessment is maintained.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
