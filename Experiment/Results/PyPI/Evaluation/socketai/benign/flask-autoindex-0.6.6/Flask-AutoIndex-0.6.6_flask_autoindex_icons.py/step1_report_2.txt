{
  "purpose": "The code defines icon mappings based on file extensions, filenames, and MIME types for a file handling or display system.",
  "sources": "Constants defining icon mappings (by_extension, by_filename, by_mimetype) and the to_list function.",
  "sinks": "Calls to File.add_icon_rule_by_ext, File.add_icon_rule_by_name, and File.add_icon_rule_by_mimetype, which likely modify internal icon rules.",
  "flows": "The icon mapping data are processed through the to_list function and then passed to the File class methods, establishing icon rules based on file attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed. The code uses standard list processing and method calls.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up icon rules for files based on extension, filename, and MIME type. It defines data structures for these mappings, uses a helper function to normalize data to lists, and then applies these rules via method calls. There is no input parsing, external data handling, or execution of untrusted data. The pattern is static configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware evident. The code's structure and purpose are straightforward and consistent with a resource management module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration setup for file icon associations. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. All operations are standard and within expected behavior for such a module.",
