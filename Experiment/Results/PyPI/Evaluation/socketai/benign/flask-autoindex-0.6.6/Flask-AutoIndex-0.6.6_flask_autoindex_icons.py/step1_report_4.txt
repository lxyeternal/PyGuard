  "purpose": "Define icon associations for file extensions, filenames, and MIME types for a file management system.",
  "sources": "Static data definitions; no input reading, data input is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "Calls to File.add_icon_rule_by_ext, File.add_icon_rule_by_name, and File.add_icon_rule_by_mimetype functions which likely register rules based on file metadata.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded icon and metadata associations are passed directly to registration functions without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code only defines static mappings.",
  "analysis": "The script imports file handling classes and defines mappings between icons and file attributes (extensions, filenames, MIME types). It uses straightforward loops to register rules via class methods. No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. Functions are used to normalize data types. The purpose appears purely to set static associations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static configuration for associating icons with file types. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
