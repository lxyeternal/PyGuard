{
  "purpose": "This code defines icon rules based on file extensions, filenames, and mimetypes for a file management or visualization application.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data defined within the lists 'by_extension', 'by_filename', and 'by_mimetype'. It also calls methods 'add_icon_rule_by_ext', 'add_icon_rule_by_name', and 'add_icon_rule_by_mimetype' from the 'File' class.",
  "sinks": "The methods 'add_icon_rule_by_ext', 'add_icon_rule_by_name', and 'add_icon_rule_by_mimetype' potentially modify internal icon mappings, but are not shown to perform untrusted actions like network access or file system changes in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Static data (extensions, filenames, mimetypes) flow into 'File' class methods to register icon rules. There are no external data inputs or outputs in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of static lists and straightforward method calls. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious or malicious logic is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes mappings between file attributes (extensions, filenames, mimetypes) and icon representations. It uses helper 'to_list' to normalize data, then registers these mappings via 'File' class methods. The code appears to be a configuration or setup script for icon associations, with no external data inputs, network activity, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script configuring icon associations for a file management interface. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided content.",
