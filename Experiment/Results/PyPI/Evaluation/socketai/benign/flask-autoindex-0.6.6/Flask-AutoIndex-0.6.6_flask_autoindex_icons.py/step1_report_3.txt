{
  "purpose": "This code assigns icons to files based on their extension, filename, or MIME type, likely for a file management or display system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined lists of file extensions, filenames, and MIME types within the script.",
  "sinks": "The code calls methods (e.g., add_icon_rule_by_ext, add_icon_rule_by_name, add_icon_rule_by_mimetype) that potentially modify internal icon rules, but these are likely safe configuration functions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the predefined lists to method calls that register icon rules based on file properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code consists of static data definitions and straightforward method calls.",
  "analysis": "The script imports classes and defines several mappings linking file attributes to icons. It uses simple loops to register rules via method calls, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation beyond configuration. No signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The purpose appears to be purely for associating visual icons with file types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration for assigning icons to files based on properties. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure is simple and static, with no suspicious or obfuscated components.",
