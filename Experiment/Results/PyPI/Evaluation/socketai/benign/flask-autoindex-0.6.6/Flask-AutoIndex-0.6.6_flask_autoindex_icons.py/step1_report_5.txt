{
  "purpose": "Assigns icons to files based on extension, filename, or MIME type for display purposes in a file management context.",
  "sources": "Reads static data: predefined lists of file extensions, filenames, and MIME types.",
  "sinks": "Calls to File.add_icon_rule_by_ext, File.add_icon_rule_by_name, and File.add_icon_rule_by_mimetype with static, trusted data.",
  "flows": "Static data -> Loop over data -> Add rules via File methods",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic input, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external network activity or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines lists of file extensions, filenames, and MIME types mapped to icons. It then iterates through these lists, converting entries to lists if necessary, and calls methods on the File class to register icon rules. All data sources are static and predefined, with no user input or external data. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration for icon mapping, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for associating file types with icons. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior. It solely performs static data processing and registration within the application.",
