  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static configuration data, with no external input or suspicious behavior. It notes the straightforward method calls and lack of malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk is 0. The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the static nature and straightforward registration of icon rules.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0. The confidence is even higher (0.95).\n- **Justification:** Correct; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report confirms the static configuration purpose, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence is perfect (1).\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—static configuration with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence is high (1).\n- **Verdict:** No issues with scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar analysis; static data, no external inputs, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence is 1.0.\n- **Note:** The security risk score is 0.1, which is slightly above zero. Given the benign nature, this might be slightly conservative but acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, static data and straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the benign, static configuration purpose.\n\n### Overall Estimation:\n\nGiven the code's nature as a static configuration setup with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.05), since no security risks are apparent.\n\n**Final note:** The existing scores are reasonable and justified based on the provided code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the scoring accurately reflects the benign, static configuration purpose of the code. No modifications are necessary.",
