  "purpose": "Static configuration script mapping file extensions, filenames, and MIME types to icons.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data structures defining icon mappings; method calls to register rules.",
  "sinks": "Methods likely modify internal mappings; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data passed to registration methods; no external data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static data and method calls with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static lists associating icons with file extensions, filenames, and MIME types. It uses simple loops to register these mappings via class methods. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The methods called appear to be safe, performing internal registration. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets are detected. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration for icon mapping, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe, straightforward setup.",
