  "purpose": "Set up a simple web server with automatic directory indexing using Flask and flask_autoindex.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (potentially from Flask configuration), standard input (HTTP requests).",
  "sinks": "HTTP response rendering directory listings, possibly exposing server directory structure.",
  "flows": "HTTP request -> Flask route handling -> AutoIndex rendering directory contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network connections, no obfuscated code, no backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a Flask extension to serve directory listings. It initializes the Flask app and enables AutoIndex for directory browsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious external network activity. The code is straightforward and uses common patterns for serving static directories.",
  "conclusion": "The script provides a basic directory listing service with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical setup for serving directory contents over HTTP.",
