  "purpose": "A Flask application serving directory listings using flask_autoindex.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and runs a Flask server.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only serves directory listings over HTTP.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'os.path' present, but benign; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Flask app that uses flask_autoindex to serve directory contents. It imports 'os.path' but does not utilize it, indicating leftover code. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or code injection. The code is simple, clear, and serves a common purpose. The security risk is low, primarily due to directory exposure, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The malware score is zero, obfuscation score is zero, and the risk score is around 0.15, reflecting minimal exposure without active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
