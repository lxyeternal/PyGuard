  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward and common pattern for initializing a Flask Blueprint. It imports the necessary class and creates an instance with a name and module context. No input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are involved. The code fragment alone shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask setup component with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It merely sets up a blueprint object for later use in a web application.",
