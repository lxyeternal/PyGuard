  "purpose": "Define a Flask blueprint named 'test' for modular application structure.",
  "sources": "Import of 'Blueprint' from Flask; creation of 'bp' instance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import -> Blueprint instance creation; no data flow beyond initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Flask's Blueprint and creates an instance named 'bp'. It is a straightforward, minimal Flask component with no data processing, input handling, or external communication. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard Flask patterns suggest no security risks or malware. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask blueprint initialization with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the scoring reflects this. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
