  "purpose": "Define a Flask Blueprint named 'test' for organizing routes in a web application.",
  "sources": "Importing Flask's Blueprint module; creating a Blueprint instance.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only initializes a Blueprint object without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Blueprint class from Flask, then creates an instance named 'bp' with the name 'test'. This is a common pattern in Flask applications for modular route management. No external inputs, untrusted data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code does not contain any obfuscated elements, malicious functions, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup for a Flask application, serving no malicious purpose or security risks.",
