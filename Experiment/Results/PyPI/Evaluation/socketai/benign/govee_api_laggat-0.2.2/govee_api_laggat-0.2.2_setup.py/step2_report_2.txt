  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python setup script.\n- No report indicates any dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- The code only reads a local README file, defines dependencies, and calls `setuptools.setup()`.\n- The commented-out dependency link is benign, not active.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of commented-out dependency link:** While benign, it could indicate previous or intended external source inclusion. However, since it's commented out, it doesn't pose an immediate risk.\n- **No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code detected.**\n\n### Logical and reasoning review:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard packaging boilerplate.\n- They appropriately note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clean code.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, correctly reflecting the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The risk scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk should stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n- The commented dependency link is not active and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No data flows, external network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is safe, standard, and poses no security concerns. The current scoring in the reports is appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
