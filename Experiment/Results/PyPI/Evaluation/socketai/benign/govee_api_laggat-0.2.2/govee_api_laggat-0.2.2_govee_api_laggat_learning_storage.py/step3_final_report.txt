  "purpose": "Framework for managing device learning information with abstract storage and a no-op fallback.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; data is stored in memory; no network or file I/O in provided code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from abstract read/write methods to internal cache; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with standard patterns and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for device info, an abstract storage class with caching, and a no-op implementation. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The warnings in abstract methods are standard developer guidance. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Scores of malware and obfuscation are correctly zero; security risk is minimal, reflecting the placeholder nature of methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard framework component for device state management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its content.",
