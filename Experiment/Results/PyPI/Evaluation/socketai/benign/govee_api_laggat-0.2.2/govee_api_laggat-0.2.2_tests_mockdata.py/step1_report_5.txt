  "purpose": "Define mock data, device configurations, and utility functions for testing GoveeDevice interactions and states.",
  "sources": "Constant variables, JSON objects, and functions that generate device and state data.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input directly; the code primarily handles predefined data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process external untrusted input dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded API keys and device information, which could be sensitive if deployed in production; no obfuscated or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a set of mock data and utility functions for testing purposes. It defines device configurations, device states, and mock network responses. There are hardcoded API keys and device identifiers, which are typical for testing but pose security risks if used improperly. No code executes external commands, performs data exfiltration, or connects to suspicious domains. No malware behaviors such as data theft, system manipulation, or reverse shells are present. The code structure is straightforward and uses standard Python patterns, with no obfuscated logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as test scaffolding with predefined data and mock classes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond the presence of hardcoded secrets (API key), which should not be in production code. Overall, it is a benign testing setup with no malware or security vulnerabilities identified.",
