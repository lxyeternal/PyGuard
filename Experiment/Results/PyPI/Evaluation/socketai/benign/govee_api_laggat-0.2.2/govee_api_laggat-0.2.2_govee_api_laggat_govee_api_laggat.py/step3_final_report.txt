  "purpose": "A Python async client library for managing Govee devices, including device discovery, control commands, state updates, and API interactions.",
  "sources": "API calls, BLE interactions, device state attributes, external storage for learned info",
  "sinks": "API responses, device state updates, event triggers, storage writes",
  "flows": "Source inputs (API, BLE, device attributes) flow through control functions and state updates, with data stored or sent over network",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard device management client with async patterns, error handling, and external storage interfaces. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are present. The storage interface is abstract and typical for such applications. The network interactions are limited to API and BLE communications, with no suspicious domains or data leaks. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent Python client for Govee device management with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external API reliance, which is standard for such clients. The reports accurately reflect this assessment, and no modifications to the scores or reasoning are necessary.",
