  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for Govee API client functionality, importing version info and classes for API interaction and storage.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (__version__, govee_api_laggat, learning_storage). No external data sources or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or output; the code only imports classes and a version string.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing paths; the code consists solely of import statements without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a simple module initialization for a Python package, importing version info and classes for API and storage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious functions or commands. It does not perform any network, file, or system operations beyond imports. The code is minimal, standard, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It simply imports modules necessary for the package functionality. No security concerns are identified in this snippet.",
