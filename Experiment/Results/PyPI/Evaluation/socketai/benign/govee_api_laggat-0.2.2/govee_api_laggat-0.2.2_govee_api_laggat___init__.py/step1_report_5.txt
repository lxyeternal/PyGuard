  "purpose": "To define the module's API by importing specific classes and variables for a Govee API client package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module files (__version__, govee_api_laggat, learning_storage).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling or external outputs; imports are static and from local modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static references.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; only import statements are present, with no dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement setup for a Python package. It imports version info, API classes for Govee devices, and learning storage classes from local modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns. No external data input, no code execution, and no obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a simple, clean package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no indications of malware or security risks. It simply imports necessary components for the package's functionality, adhering to standard practices.",
