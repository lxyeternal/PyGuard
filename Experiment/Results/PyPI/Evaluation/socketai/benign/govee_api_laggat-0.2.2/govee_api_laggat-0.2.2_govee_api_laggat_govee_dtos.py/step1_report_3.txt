  "purpose": "Define data structures and enums for Govee API device representation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; only class and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward data structure definitions with no unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Python data classes and an enum for representing Govee devices. It uses standard libraries: dataclasses, enum, typing. There are no input/output operations, no network calls, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or external data handling observed. The purpose appears to be data modeling for device state management within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data structure definition with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It serves as a data transfer object model for Govee devices and does not pose a security risk.",
