  "purpose": "Define data structures and enumerations for Govee API device information and source type.",
  "sources": "None (no input/output operations or data reading evident in the provided code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data flow to external systems or sensitive sinks).",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the code solely defines data classes and enums without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior present. The code is straightforward data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains enum and dataclass definitions to represent Govee device attributes and source types. It uses standard Python modules and typing hints without executing dynamic code or handling untrusted input. No potential security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation patterns are detected. The code appears purely structural and descriptive, serving as a data schema for API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and standard implementation of data transfer objects for representing Govee devices. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It serves its purpose as a data schema without security concerns.",
