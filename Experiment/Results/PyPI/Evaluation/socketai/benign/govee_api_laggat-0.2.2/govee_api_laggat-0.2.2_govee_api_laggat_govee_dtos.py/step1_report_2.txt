  "purpose": "Define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for Govee API device interactions and configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dataclasses', 'enum', and 'typing'; class and variable declarations; class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None present; code primarily defines data structures without input/output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only declares data models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No dynamic execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data structures to represent Govee devices and their configurations using Python's dataclasses and enums. It imports standard libraries and uses type annotations for clarity. No external input handling, network operations, or insecure coding patterns are present. The code appears to be purely declarative, setting up schemas for device data without any embedded logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines data models for Govee devices without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform input/output, network communication, or data processing that could lead to security issues. Overall, it appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
