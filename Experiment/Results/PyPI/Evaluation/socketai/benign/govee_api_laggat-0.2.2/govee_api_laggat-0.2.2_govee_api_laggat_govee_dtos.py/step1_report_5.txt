  "purpose": "Data transfer objects (DTOs) for Govee API device information and state representation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read within this code; only class and data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions are present.",
  "flows": "This code defines data structures; there are no data flows or processing logic to analyze.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The enum and dataclass are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of enums and dataclasses to model Govee device data. It uses standard Python features: Enum and dataclass, with no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no cryptography, or handling of untrusted inputs. No embedded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic are present. This appears to be a typical data model used in an API wrapper or device control library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for device state and configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any embedded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The likelihood of malware is very low.",
