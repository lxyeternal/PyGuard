  "purpose": "Data transfer objects (DTOs) for Govee API device information and source enumeration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dataclasses, enum, and typing modules; class and variable definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The code defines data structures; there are no data flows or processing logic involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward DTO definitions with standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and dataclasses to model Govee device data and source types. It includes descriptive comments and type annotations. No data input handling, no external communication, no code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The code appears to be standard data structure definitions with no embedded logic that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of data class and enum definitions used for representing Govee device information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code segments. It appears to be a standard and benign implementation of data transfer objects.",
