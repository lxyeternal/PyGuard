{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and enums for Govee API device representation, serving as DTOs.",
  "sources": "No external input; static class and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; purely data modeling.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python dataclasses and enums modeling Govee devices. It contains no input handling, network communication, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data transfer objects for the Govee API. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
