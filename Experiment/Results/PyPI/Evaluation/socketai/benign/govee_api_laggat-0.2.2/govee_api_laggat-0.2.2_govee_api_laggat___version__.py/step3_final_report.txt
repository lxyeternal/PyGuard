  "purpose": "Declare the software version as a static string.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple, straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable, with no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external data. It is a minimal, static declaration typical in software projects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions mean there are no source-to-sink flows or suspicious patterns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
