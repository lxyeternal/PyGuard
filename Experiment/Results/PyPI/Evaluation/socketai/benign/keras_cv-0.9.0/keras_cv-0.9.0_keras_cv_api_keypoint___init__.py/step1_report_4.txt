{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import modules related to keypoint conversion and filtering, likely used in computer vision tasks involving keypoint formats and image filtering.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'keras_cv.src.keypoint' modules: 'convert_format', 'REL_XY', 'XY', and 'filter_out_of_image'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling; imports are used for functionality within the module.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and constants, which would be used elsewhere in the application for processing keypoints and filtering images, but no data flows are explicitly shown here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The comment indicates autogenerated code, which is common and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement set, with no active processing, no data inputs, or untrusted data flows. The comment at the top warns against manual edits, indicating maintainability considerations. No malicious activity or sabotage indicators are present. All imported modules relate to standard image/keypoint processing functions within a known library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for keypoint and image filtering functionalities from a reputable library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
