  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a library related to keypoint format conversion and utilities for image processing in KerasCV.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load functions and constants from the keras_cv.src.keypoint module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is processed or transferred to external systems",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing observed in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present; the file is autogenerated and contains only import statements",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments indicating it is autogenerated and import statements from a KerasCV module. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other suspicious actions. The imports are standard for a library handling keypoint formats and utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a normal, harmless part of a library setup with no harmful functionality.",
