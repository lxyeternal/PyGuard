  "purpose": "Autogenerated import statements from keras_cv.src.keypoint modules for keypoint format conversions and utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from keras_cv.src.keypoint.converters, formats, and utils modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import references.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, autogenerated import statements with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a reputable library, with a comment indicating autogenerated status. No dynamic behavior, data processing, or network activity is present. The code is not obfuscated, contains no hardcoded secrets, and does not perform any malicious actions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1 or 0). The code's simplicity and the context of standard library imports justify these scores. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is safe, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated set of import statements from keras_cv.src.keypoint, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
