{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules related to bounding box processing from the keras_cv library, serving as a setup or utility module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from keras_cv.src.bounding_box and its submodules",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external communication; purely import statements",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only module imports at load time",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is autogenerated, straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for bounding box utilities, with a comment indicating autogenerated status. There is no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code suggests a benign purpose. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: near zero) are consistent with the benign, library-initialization nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated module importing bounding box utilities from keras_cv. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation or suspicious activity. The current scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
