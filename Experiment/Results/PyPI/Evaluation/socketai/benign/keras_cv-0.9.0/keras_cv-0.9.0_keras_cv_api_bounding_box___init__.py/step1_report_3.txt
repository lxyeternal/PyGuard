{
  "purpose": "This code imports various functions and constants related to bounding box processing in computer vision, specifically for use with KerasCV library components.",
  "sources": "Imports from the keras_cv.src.bounding_box module and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or data leaks are evident; the code only imports functions and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely import statements without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains only import statements with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the keras_cv.src.bounding_box package. It includes various format constants, utility functions, and IOU computations. No user input, environment variables, or data handling occurs here. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The autogenerated comment suggests it is a generated file intended for internal use. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard autogenerated import module for bounding box utilities in KerasCV, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
