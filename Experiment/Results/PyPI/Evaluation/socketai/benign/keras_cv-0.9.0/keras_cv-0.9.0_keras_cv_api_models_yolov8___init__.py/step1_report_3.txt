  "purpose": "Importing a label encoder class for YOLOv8 object detection model from the keras_cv library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from keras_cv.src.models.object_detection.yolo_v8.yolo_v8_label_encoder",
  "sinks": "No evident sink where untrusted data flows or causes harm",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; just an import statement",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates autogenerated code, which is common and not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code features observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment warning against editing, followed by a straightforward import of a label encoder class from a deep learning library. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import path appears legitimate for a machine learning model component. No sources or sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are identified. The structure is simple and standard for a Python module importing a class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement for a machine learning component with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
