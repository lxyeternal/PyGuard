{
  "purpose": "Importing a label encoder class for object detection model, likely used for processing YOLOv8 model outputs.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; only an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, explicitly states not to edit, and only contains an import statement with a deep module path.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and solely imports a class from a specific module within keras_cv. There are no dynamic code executions, no use of environment variables, no hardcoded secrets, and no apparent malicious actions. The deep module import could be unusual but is not inherently malicious. The auto-generated comment indicates standard code generation practices, not malicious obfuscation or malware. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a benign, auto-generated import statement for a label encoder used in object detection models. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
