  "purpose": "Importing a label encoder class from a specific object detection model within the keras_cv library.",
  "sources": "The import statement that references a module within keras_cv.src.models.object_detection.yolo_v8",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only performs a module import",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the file is autogenerated; no suspicious or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a class named YOLOV8LabelEncoder from a deep module path within keras_cv. The initial comment warns against manual editing but does not suggest malicious intent. No input/output handling, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The import appears to be standard for setting up object detection functionalities. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement intended for model label encoding in a computer vision pipeline. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
