  "purpose": "Importing a label encoder class for YOLOv8 object detection model from the keras_cv library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a class from a module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from source to sink, as only an import statement exists.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the file is autogenerated and should not be edited; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a well-known library (keras_cv). The comment warns that the file is autogenerated, which is typical for code generated by tools and not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The imported module is part of a standard ML library, and no code execution or data manipulation is visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with a standard autogenerated comment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
