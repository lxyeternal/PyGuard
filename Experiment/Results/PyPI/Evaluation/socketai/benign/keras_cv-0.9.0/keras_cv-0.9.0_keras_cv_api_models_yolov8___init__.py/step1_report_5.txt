  "purpose": "Importing a label encoder class from a specific YOLOv8 object detection model in Keras CV.",
  "sources": "Import statement from keras_cv.src.models.object_detection.yolo_v8.yolo_v8_label_encoder",
  "sinks": "Import statement itself; no data processing or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data input; import is static and predefined",
  "anomalies": "Presence of autogenerated comment indicating automatic code generation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with an autogenerated comment warning against manual edits. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of untrusted data, no suspicious behaviors, and no embedded malicious code. It appears to be a standard import of a label encoder class from a well-known library path for a machine learning model.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with an autogenerated comment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected.",
