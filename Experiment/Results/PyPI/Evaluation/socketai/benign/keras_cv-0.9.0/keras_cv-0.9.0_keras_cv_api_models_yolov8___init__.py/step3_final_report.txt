  "purpose": "Import a label encoder class for YOLOv8 object detection from keras_cv library.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data or input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data, only imports a class.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code is a static import statement with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward import with an autogenerated comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static import statement importing 'YOLOV8LabelEncoder' from a deep module path within keras_cv. The accompanying comment indicates the file is autogenerated and should not be manually edited. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is standard for ML model setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The module path is deep but legitimate, and the code's purpose is to load a class for object detection tasks. All signals point to benign, well-structured code with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated import statement with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
