  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the keras-cv library.",
  "sources": "Reads files for version and description information, reads environment variables, and gathers package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file reads provide data used in setup parameters, with no untrusted input affecting critical operations or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code reads version info from files, handles environment variables securely, and does not execute untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package metadata, dependencies, and build configuration. It reads version info from specific files, checks environment variables for build flags, and sets up package parameters accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code is standard for a Python package setup script. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The use of environment variables and file reading is typical and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles package configuration safely and appropriately.",
