  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The code reads version info from files, uses environment variables for build options, and sets up package metadata.\n- No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is detected.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is in report 4, which assigns a security risk score of 0.1 due to reading version info from external files without validation. However, this is common in setup scripts and not inherently risky.\n\n**Confirmations & Discrepancies:**\n- The code snippets in all reports match the provided setup script.\n- No issues are present in the code; all operations are typical for package setup.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports give a risk score of 0 or 0.1. Given the benign nature of the script, a score of 0 is justified. The 0.1 in report 4 is minor and can be considered acceptable, but overall, the risk is negligible.\n\n**Any Potential Issues or Assumptions?**\n- No suspicious assumptions are made about the environment variables or file reads; they are standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious logic are present.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic or unsafe operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is standard, secure, and free from malicious or obfuscated code. The scores and reasoning in the reports are appropriate.",
