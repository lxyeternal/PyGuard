  "purpose": "Setup script for the keras-cv Python package, used to configure package installation, dependencies, and distribution details.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file, version information from version_utils.py or src/version_utils.py, environment variables, and package files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted, nor are there any insecure operations performed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or file reads provide data for versioning and build configurations, but do not lead to any security-sensitive actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard setup procedures with normal file reads and environment checks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for setup configuration, reads package metadata from files, and sets up environment-based build options. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are present. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward, typical for Python package setup scripts, and adheres to best practices without obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs normal package configuration tasks without any malicious intent.",
