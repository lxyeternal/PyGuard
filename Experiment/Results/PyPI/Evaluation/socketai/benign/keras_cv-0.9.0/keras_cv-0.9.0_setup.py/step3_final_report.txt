  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the keras-cv Python package, responsible for package configuration, version retrieval, and build customization.",
  "sources": "File reads for version info, environment variable 'BUILD_WITH_CUSTOM_OPS', and package metadata inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations; standard setup tasks only.",
  "flows": "Reading version files and environment variables influence package build configuration; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading version info from files, checking environment variables for build options, and defining dependencies and metadata. It contains no network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The environment variable 'BUILD_WITH_CUSTOM_OPS' is used for build customization, which is standard. All operations are benign, and the code follows best practices. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
