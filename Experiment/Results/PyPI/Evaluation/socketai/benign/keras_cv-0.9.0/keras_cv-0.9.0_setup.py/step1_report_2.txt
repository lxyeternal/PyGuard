  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the keras-cv library.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from files, environment variable BUILD_WITH_CUSTOM_OPS, and file system for README.md and version files.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file reads influence configuration but do not lead to untrusted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; environment variable check for BUILD_WITH_CUSTOM_OPS is standard for build customization. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading version info from files, configuring build options based on environment variables, and setting up package metadata and dependencies. The use of environment variables and file reading appears benign and typical for such scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It strictly handles package configuration and setup procedures.",
