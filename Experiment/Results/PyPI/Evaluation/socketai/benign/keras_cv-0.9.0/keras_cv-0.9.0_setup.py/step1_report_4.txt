{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging the keras-cv library, including version retrieval, dependency specification, and distribution customization.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from version utility files, environment variables, and the README file; imports modules and reads local files.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or operations that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from files and environment variables; uses these data to configure the package build process.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads version info from external files and environment variables without validation, but this is standard for setup scripts; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info, configuring distribution, and defining dependencies. It uses environment variables and file reads securely and without obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The use of external files for versioning is common. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard configuration tasks securely.",
