  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided setup script step-by-step.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package (`keras-cv`).\n- It reads version info from files (`version_utils.py` or `src/version_utils.py`).\n- It uses environment variables (`BUILD_WITH_CUSTOM_OPS`) to configure build options.\n- It reads the README.md for long description.\n- It defines dependencies, extras, and classifiers.\n- It does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to follow best practices for a package setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  No issues are present. The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n\n### Logical Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes:\n- **Errors or mistakes:**  \n  None detected. The script is straightforward and correctly implements standard setup logic.\n\n### Scores Given in Reports:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Some reports assign a security risk score of 0.1, which seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the reliance on environment variables and file reads, which are standard in setup scripts.\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- **Why scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified:**  \n  The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or execute untrusted data. It only reads files and environment variables for configuration.  \n- **Malware score:**  \n  The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  The code is clear and not obfuscated. Scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent but note the use of environment variables and file reads, which are common.  \n- No suspicious behavior or backdoors are suggested or detected.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report could be justified by the reliance on environment variables, but this is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of environment variables and file reads is typical for such scripts and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
