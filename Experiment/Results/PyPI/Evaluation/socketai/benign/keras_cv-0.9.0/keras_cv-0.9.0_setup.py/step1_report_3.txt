  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'keras-cv' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and build configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading version from version_utils.py or src/version_utils.py, environment variable BUILD_WITH_CUSTOM_OP, reading README.md file.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable BUILD_WITH_CUSTOM_OP influences build configuration; version information from files influences package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup procedures; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools. It reads version information from specific files, conditionally modifies build behavior based on an environment variable, and defines package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for package setup and do not involve any malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a legitimate, standard setup file for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
