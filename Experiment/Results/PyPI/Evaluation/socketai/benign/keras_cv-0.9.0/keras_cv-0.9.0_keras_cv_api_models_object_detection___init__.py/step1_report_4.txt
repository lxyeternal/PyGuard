{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific object detection models from the keras_cv library, likely for use in an object detection task.",
  "sources": "Imports from keras_cv.src.models.object_detection.retinanet.retinanet and keras_cv.src.models.object_detection.yolo_v8.yolo_v8_detector",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks are evident in this code",
  "anomalies": "The code is autogenerated with a warning not to modify it; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements for well-known model classes from the keras_cv library. The comment indicates automatic generation and warns against manual editing, but this does not imply malicious intent. There are no data inputs, network operations, or other typical malicious activity indicators. The code structure is standard for importing modules, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign import statement section for an object detection project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this fragment.",
