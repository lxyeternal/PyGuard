{
  "purpose": "The code imports pre-defined object detection models from external libraries for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and classes related to object detection models.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports model classes which can later be instantiated or used, but there are no data flows or execution paths shown.",
  "anomalies": "The file is autogenerated and contains no custom logic or potentially malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement for existing, well-known deep learning model classes from keras_cv. The file's comment indicates it's autogenerated and should not be edited. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are apparent. Since it only imports modules, there are no sources or sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities. The purpose seems to be modular inclusion of object detection models for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, autogenerated import script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports model classes from external libraries without any sensitive operations.",
