  "purpose": "Import statements for object detection models from keras_cv, autogenerated for model setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from keras_cv.src.models.object_detection modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or code execution points present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static import statements only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward import statements for two object detection models, with comments indicating autogenerated status. No data input, network activity, or execution logic is present. The code is typical for a module that prepares model imports for downstream use. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are observed. The code's simplicity and the context suggest it is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated import module for object detection models, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
