{
  "purpose": "The code imports object detection models from the keras_cv library, likely for use in computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "The imported modules from keras_cv.src.models.object_detection.retinanet and keras_cv.src.models.object_detection.yolo_v8",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or input/output handling in this code",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment indicating it is autogenerated, which is normal; no suspicious or malicious code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports two object detection models from a well-known open-source library, keras_cv. The comment states the file is autogenerated, which does not raise suspicion. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No data handling, network activity, or code execution mechanisms are included that could be malicious. The code appears to be a straightforward import statement for use in larger projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a model import setup. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
