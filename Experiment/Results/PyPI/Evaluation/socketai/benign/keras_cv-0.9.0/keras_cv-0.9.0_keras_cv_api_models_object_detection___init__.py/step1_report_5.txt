{
  "purpose": "This code imports object detection model classes from the keras_cv library, specifically RetinaNet and YOLOV8Detector.",
  "sources": "Import statements from keras_cv.src.models.object_detection for RetinaNet and YOLOV8Detector.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only imports classes without executing any untrusted data processing or system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only contains import statements without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The header comment indicates the file is autogenerated and should not be edited; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and a comment indicating automatic generation. There are no inputs, data processing, or system interactions that could be exploited or contain malicious behavior. The imports are from standard, reputable deep learning model classes, and no obfuscated or suspicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import machine learning model classes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
