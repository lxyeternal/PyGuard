{
  "purpose": "The code imports object detection models from the keras_cv library, likely for use in an application involving image analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external library modules (keras_cv.src.models.object_detection).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, as the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports classes without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an autogenerated file warning; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an autogenerated file notice. No input reading, data handling, or potentially dangerous code constructs are present. The imports are from reputable source files for object detection models, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code. The file explicitly states it is autogenerated and should not be edited, which is typical for code generated by build tools or code generators. No suspicious behavior or malware indicators identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated module that imports object detection models from the keras_cv library. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
