{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the keras_cv library, likely for use in a computer vision or machine learning project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from keras_cv.api and keras_cv.src.version_utils, which load modules and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only static imports are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; imports are static and not dynamic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment warning not to edit and notes that it was autogenerated, which is typical for generated code but not suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from a known library, keras_cv. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious functions. The comment indicates it is autogenerated, likely for configuration or setup purposes. All imported modules are from a reputable library; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard autogenerated import script for keras_cv modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
