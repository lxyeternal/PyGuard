  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications, scores, and consistency.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as an autogenerated module importing various parts of the keras_cv.api library.\n- The code consists solely of static import statements with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity.\n- The comments explicitly state the file is autogenerated and should not be manually edited.\n- The imported modules are from a reputable open-source library (keras_cv), used for computer vision tasks.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No, the code is straightforward import statements.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** None detected.\n- **Data flows or sinks:** None, as the code only imports modules.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the fact that the file is autogenerated, which is common and not suspicious.\n\n### Scores Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0 or 0.5; given the absence of any security concerns, 0 seems appropriate.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since the code only performs static imports, there's no reason to assign a higher risk.\n- The comments about being autogenerated are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The imported modules are from a legitimate library, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjust scores if necessary:** All scores are reasonable at 0 or 0.5. I would recommend setting:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n- **Potential higher scores?** Only if there were hidden malicious code or obfuscation, which there isn't.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\nBased on the detailed review, I estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, standard boilerplate for module imports, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate; I suggest maintaining them at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
