{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an autogenerated import script for the keras_cv library, primarily importing various modules and version utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from the keras_cv.api package and version_utils modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is processed or transferred to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data inputs; only static module imports.",
  "anomalies": "The comment explicitly states the file is autogenerated and should not be edited. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of import statements from the keras_cv library and version utility modules. The initial comment indicates it's an autogenerated file, which is common for API or dependency initialization. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, credential handling, or code execution beyond imports. The imported modules are standard for a computer vision library and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign autogenerated import script for keras_cv modules with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
