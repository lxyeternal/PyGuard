  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to confirm the presence or absence of issues, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of import statements from the keras_cv library and version utility modules.\n- The comments explicitly state that the file is autogenerated and should not be manually edited.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or credential handling is present.\n- The imported modules are from a reputable open-source library (keras_cv) used for computer vision tasks.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malware indicators are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains static import statements.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All reports assign 0 scores, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Purpose and analysis:** The purpose as an autogenerated dependency setup is consistent across reports.\n- **Potential issues:** No issues are present or implied.\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n- The **malware score** of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- The **security risk score** of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The **confidence scores** of 1 are reasonable given the clear, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justifications:\n- Since the code is purely static imports with no dynamic or sensitive operations, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The comments indicating autogenerated code are standard and do not imply malicious intent.\n- The imported modules are from a well-known library, reducing the likelihood of malicious code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; all scores are appropriate.\n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is safe, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. I agree with the existing scores and reasoning.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard autogenerated import module for the keras_cv library, with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
