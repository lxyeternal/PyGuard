{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules from the keras_cv.api package, likely to be used for computer vision tasks such as bounding boxes, callbacks, core functions, datasets, keypoints, layers, losses, metrics, models, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from keras_cv.api and keras_cv.src.version_utils modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code consists solely of straightforward import statements with a comment indicating autogenerated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of import statements from the keras_cv library, importing modules related to computer vision functionalities. The initial comment indicates the file is autogenerated and should not be edited, which is common in build or code generation tools. No dynamic execution, user input handling, or network operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign import module setup for a larger project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
