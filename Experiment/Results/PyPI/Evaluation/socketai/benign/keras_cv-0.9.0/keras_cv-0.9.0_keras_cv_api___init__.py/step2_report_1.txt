  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a set of static import statements from the `keras_cv.api` package and version utility modules.\n   - The initial comment clearly states that the file is autogenerated and should not be edited manually.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n   - The imports are from a reputable open-source library (`keras_cv`), which is used for computer vision tasks.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior & Security Risks:**\n   - No suspicious code, such as code that writes to files, network calls, or credential handling, is present.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data or contain any sink points.\n   - The comments and structure are typical of autogenerated dependency or setup files.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - There are no logical errors or mistakes; the code's purpose is purely to import modules.\n   - The report notes that the code is benign and typical for a setup or dependency file.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no vulnerabilities based on the static import statements.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made; the analysis is consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary; the code is benign.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, autogenerated import module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves a benign purpose in setting up dependencies for a larger project.",
