{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an autogenerated header for importing modules from the keras_cv API, likely setting up environment for a larger application involving computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from keras_cv.api and version_utils modules",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks or untrusted data handling; purely importing modules",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow present in import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statements and autogenerated warning comments",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the keras_cv package, which is a reputable open-source library for computer vision tasks. The comment indicates the file is autogenerated and should not be manually edited. There are no signs of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All imports are from legitimate library modules. The code is minimal and standard, with no unusual language features or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard autogenerated import setup for keras_cv modules. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The code is safe and typical for a Python project initializing dependencies.",
