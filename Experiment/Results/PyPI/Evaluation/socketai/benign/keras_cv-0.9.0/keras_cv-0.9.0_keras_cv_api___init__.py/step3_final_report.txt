{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an autogenerated dependency import module for the keras_cv library, importing various components necessary for computer vision tasks.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from keras_cv.api modules and version utility modules.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports modules without dynamic data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the autogenerated comment, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from a reputable open-source library (keras_cv). There are no functions, data processing, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The comments indicate it is autogenerated, typical for dependency setup files. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated import module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves a standard purpose in setting up dependencies for a larger project, and the provided assessments are accurate.",
