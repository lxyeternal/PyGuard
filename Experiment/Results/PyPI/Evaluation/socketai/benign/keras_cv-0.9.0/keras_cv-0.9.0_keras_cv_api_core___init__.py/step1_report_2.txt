{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import various classes related to factor sampling from the keras_cv library, likely for use in machine learning or computer vision workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports from keras_cv.src.core.factor_sampler modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations observed",
  "flows": "N/A - purely import statements without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected; comments indicate autogenerated code",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a comment warning against editing and several import statements from a well-known library. There are no functions, data processing, or execution flows that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as an import configuration for sampling classes within keras_cv. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
