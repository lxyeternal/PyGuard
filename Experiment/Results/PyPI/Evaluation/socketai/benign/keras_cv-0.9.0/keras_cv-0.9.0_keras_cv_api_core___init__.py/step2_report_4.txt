  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from the keras_cv library, with comments indicating autogenerated files.\n- No runtime data handling, network activity, or untrusted input processing is observed.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for a module that imports classes for later use.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is purely import statements with a comment; no issues or malicious activity are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are identified; the code's purpose is clear and standard.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct, since the code doesn't pose any security threat.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all findings are based on the code's static and benign nature.\n- The scores align with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Based on all reports and the code content, my own assessment is:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, autogenerated module with only import statements from a reputable library, posing no security concerns.",
