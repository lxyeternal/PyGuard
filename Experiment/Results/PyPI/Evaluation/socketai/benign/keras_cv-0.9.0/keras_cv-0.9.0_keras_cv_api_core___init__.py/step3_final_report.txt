  "purpose": "Autogenerated module importing classes from keras_cv.src.core.factor_sampler for sampling strategies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from keras_cv.src.core.factor_sampler modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or runtime logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, autogenerated import statements with a warning comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a reputable open-source library, with a comment indicating it is autogenerated. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or runtime logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's static nature and standard structure suggest it is benign. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, consistent with the code's content. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified. The code poses no security threat and is typical boilerplate for module imports in ML projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements from a reputable library, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
