{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import different classes related to sampling factors from a library, likely for machine learning or data augmentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'keras_cv.src.core.factor_sampler', which are internal module paths used to load specific sampler classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially harmful actions are present; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs static imports without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The file claims to be autogenerated and contains no executable or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known machine learning library, with a header indicating it is autogenerated. No dynamic code, user input handling, or data processing is present. The structure and content do not suggest malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of import statements from a public library, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The file appears benign and standard for a library module.",
