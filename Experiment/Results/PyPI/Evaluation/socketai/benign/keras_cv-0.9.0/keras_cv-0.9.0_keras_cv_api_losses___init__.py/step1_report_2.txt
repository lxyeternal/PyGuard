{
  "purpose": "Importing various loss functions from the keras_cv library, likely for use in a machine learning model training pipeline.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing modules from keras_cv.src.losses",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms present",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected; autogenerated comment indicates standard code generation",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from a well-known open-source library (keras_cv). The initial comment specifies the file is autogenerated and should not be edited. No dynamic execution, data input/output, or suspicious constructs are present. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The imports pertain to loss functions used in ML training, which are typical in such contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign autogenerated import module for ML loss functions from keras_cv. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
