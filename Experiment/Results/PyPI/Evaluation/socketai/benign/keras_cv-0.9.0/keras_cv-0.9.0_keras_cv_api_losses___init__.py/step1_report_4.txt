{
  "purpose": "This code imports various loss functions from the keras_cv library, likely for use in training machine learning models.",
  "sources": "The imports are from the keras_cv.src.losses module, which reads the package files and possibly some internal data structures.",
  "targets": "The imported loss functions are used as sinks when called or instantiated elsewhere; this code itself does not execute untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "The code flows from package imports (sources) to subsequent use in training or evaluation scripts, but no runtime data flow is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are observed; the file is autogenerated and contains only straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known machine learning library. It does not include any data processing, network communication, or malicious functions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The comment indicates the file is autogenerated, which is common in ML projects. Overall, there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for importing loss functions from the keras_cv library. It shows no malicious activity or security risks.",
