  "purpose": "Import statements for various keras_cv loss functions, autogenerated for ML pipeline setup.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from keras_cv.src.losses modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; only module imports.",
  "flows": "N/A - static imports without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, autogenerated, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements for loss functions from keras_cv, with comments indicating autogenerated code. No dynamic code, network activity, or data handling is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses reputable libraries. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The absence of any suspicious patterns or activity confirms the low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated import module for ML loss functions with no malicious or security concerns. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
