  "purpose": "Import various loss functions from the keras_cv library for use in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the keras_cv.src.losses module, importing specific classes.",
  "targets": "The imported loss classes are used in training models, but no external or untrusted data is processed here.",
  "flows": "The code does not process any external input or output; it only imports modules and classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement for various loss functions, with a comment warning not to edit the autogenerated file. No input/output operations, network connections, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard autogenerated import file for machine learning loss functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
