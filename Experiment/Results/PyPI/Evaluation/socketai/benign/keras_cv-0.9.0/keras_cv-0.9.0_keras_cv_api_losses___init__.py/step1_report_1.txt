{
  "purpose": "Import various loss functions from the keras_cv library for use in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; imports are static from library files.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations or data leaks; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A – static imports only; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests autogenerated code, but no malicious or suspicious patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a well-known machine learning library, keras_cv. The comment indicates it is autogenerated, and the imports are typical for setting up model loss functions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. No external network activity or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of import statements for ML loss functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard, safe code for a machine learning project.",
