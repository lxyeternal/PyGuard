  "purpose": "Autogenerated module setup for keras_cv.api, importing all contents from a specific directory and managing namespace and path configurations.",
  "sources": "os module for path operations and environment manipulation, import statements for keras_cv.api, __path__ manipulation for adding directories.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe modifications to __path__ and dynamic directory appending, although controlled within the module initialization.",
  "flows": "os module usage (source) -> appending to __path__ (sink) -> import statements (source) -> namespace manipulation (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flows. It appears to be a standard autogenerated setup script. The comment explicitly states it's autogenerated and should not be edited.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the entire keras_cv.api module, then appends a subdirectory to __path__, which affects module search paths at runtime. It deletes the os module after use, which is a common pattern to prevent namespace pollution. It defines __dir__() to control namespace introspection and __all__ to restrict exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. All operations are typical for dynamic module setup and namespace management, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard autogenerated module setup script for keras_cv.api, performing namespace management and path configuration. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks present.",
