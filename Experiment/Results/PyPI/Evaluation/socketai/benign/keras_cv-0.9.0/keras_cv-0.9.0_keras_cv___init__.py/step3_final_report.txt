  "purpose": "Autogenerated module initializer for keras_cv.api, managing imports and namespace setup.",
  "sources": "Reads filesystem path to append 'api' directory; imports everything from keras_cv.api.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or file leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports from keras_cv.api, appends to __path__, deletes os module; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' in package init, dynamic modification of __path__, deletion of os module; common in autogenerated code but noteworthy.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard autogenerated setup script for a Python package, managing imports, namespace, and module paths. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of 'import *' and dynamic path modification are typical in such scripts, though they can be risky if misused. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are detected. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, with high confidence. Slightly elevated risk score (0.1) in one report is justified but can be lowered to 0, as the code's purpose is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package setup boilerplate with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate; no modifications needed.",
