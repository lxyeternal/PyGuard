  "purpose": "Utility functions to temporarily suppress type checking, supporting both decorator and context manager usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters and internal control structures; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The suppression counter increments at source points (decorator or context manager entry) and decrements at exit, controlling type checking suppression.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of global variable is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, thread-safe utility for temporarily disabling type checks, using a global counter protected by a lock. It supports nested suppression via context manager and decorator. No external interactions, no malicious code, and no obfuscation are present. The implementation aligns with best practices for thread safety and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for development/debugging purposes. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current low security risk score (0.1) is acceptable but can be confidently set to 0, reflecting its safe nature.",
