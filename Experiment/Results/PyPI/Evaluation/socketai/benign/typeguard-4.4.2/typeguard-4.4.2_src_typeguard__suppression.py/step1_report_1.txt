  "purpose": "Utility functions for temporarily suppressing type checks, used as a context manager or decorator.",
  "sources": "User calls to suppress_type_checks as a decorator or within a with statement; imports from sys, collections.abc, contextlib, functools, threading, typing.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Input from function calls or context manager entering suppress_type_checks; no data flow leading to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No use of unsafe or malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a thread-safe mechanism to suppress type checking, supporting both decorator and context manager usage. It manipulates a global counter protected by a lock to manage nested suppression states. Uses standard library modules and does not interact with untrusted inputs or external systems. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected. The logic appears straightforward and typical for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a safe, utility mechanism for controlling type checking during runtime. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
