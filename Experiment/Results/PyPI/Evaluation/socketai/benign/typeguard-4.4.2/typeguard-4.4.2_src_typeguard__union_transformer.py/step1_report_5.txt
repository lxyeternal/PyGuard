  "purpose": "Transforms lazy evaluated PEP 604 union types into typing.Union for compatibility with older Python versions.",
  "sources": "parse() function parsing the hint string, and compile() executing the transformed AST.",
  "sinks": "compile() executes the AST, which could potentially be malicious if the input string is malicious.",
  "flows": "parse() -> visit() and transform AST -> fix_missing_locations() -> compile()",
  "anomalies": "Uses eval mode in parse() which can evaluate malicious code if the input is untrusted; no input validation or sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily transforms type hints written with '|' into traditional Union types. It uses the ast module to parse, modify, and compile code. The parse() function with 'eval' mode can execute malicious code if the input string 'hint' is malicious, but in this context, it's meant for type hints. The overall code does not perform network activity, file access, or any other malicious actions. The use of eval mode in parsing hints is a potential security concern if input is untrusted, as it could lead to code execution. However, in typical usage for type hints, this is controlled, and the code itself doesn't contain malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for transforming type annotations for compatibility, with the only potential concern being the use of eval mode in parsing. No malicious intent or malware is evident. Overall security risk is low, but caution should be exercised if the input 'hint' string comes from an untrusted source.",
