  "purpose": "Contains information necessary for type checkers to do their work, including globals, locals, self_type, and configuration.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the class simply stores provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility class for managing type checking context, with attributes for globals, locals, self_type, and configuration. It uses standard Python practices, type annotations, and no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or I/O. The implementation is simple and safe, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility class for type checking context management. It presents no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
