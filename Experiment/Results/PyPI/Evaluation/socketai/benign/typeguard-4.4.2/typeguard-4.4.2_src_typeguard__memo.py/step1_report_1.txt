{
  "purpose": "Defines a class 'TypeCheckMemo' that stores context information for type checking operations, including global and local variables, the current class type, and configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future annotations, typing module, and typeguard._config; initialization of class attributes from constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs; no untrusted data processing or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No evident data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; data is stored internally within class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present. The code is straightforward and standard for a type checking utility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class with attributes for type checking context. The constructor initializes these attributes with provided arguments, defaulting to global configuration where applicable. No external data is read at runtime beyond constructor parameters, which are typical and safe. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard utility class for type checking with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation for managing type checking context. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
