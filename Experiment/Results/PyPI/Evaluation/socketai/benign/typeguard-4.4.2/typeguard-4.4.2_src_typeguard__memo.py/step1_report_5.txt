{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for holding context information necessary for type checking in Python, including globals, locals, self_type, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the constructor parameters: globals, locals, self_type, config.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into class attributes; no external data flow or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class with attributes to store context for type checking. It uses type annotations and default values appropriately. The constructor assigns input parameters directly to class attributes, with no processing or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or external inputs are processed in a way that could be malicious. The code appears to be straightforward, functional, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class definition used for internal data storage related to type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
