  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing type checking metadata, including global/local variables and configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, and typeguard._config modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition that encapsulates metadata for type checking. It imports standard modules and a configuration object from typeguard. The constructor assigns input parameters to class attributes without processing or executing dynamic code. There are no network calls, file operations, or other suspicious activities. The structure is clear and adheres to typical Python practices. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and serves a utility purpose within a type checking context. It contains no malicious intent, sensitive data handling, or suspicious operations.",
