{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for storing metadata and configuration for type checking operations in Python, facilitating static type analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, and typeguard modules; class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data from constructor arguments stored in class attributes; no external data flow or processing beyond initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. Code is straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules related to type checking and defines a class with attributes for global/local variables, self-type, and configuration. The class constructor initializes these attributes. There are no dynamic code executions, external data fetching, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard, safe, and intended for internal type checking logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data container class for type checking context. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated or suspicious code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
