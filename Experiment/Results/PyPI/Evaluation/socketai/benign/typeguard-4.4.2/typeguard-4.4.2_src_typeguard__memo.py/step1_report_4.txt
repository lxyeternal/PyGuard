{
  "purpose": "Define a class for holding type checking context and configuration information for a type validation system.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class constructor parameters that read external modules and variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into class attributes; no untrusted external data flow to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; code primarily consists of class definition and initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration modules, defines a class with specified attributes, and initializes these attributes via the constructor. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. It serves as a data container for type checking context. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class definition intended for internal use within a type checking framework. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
