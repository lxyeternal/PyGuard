  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting up project metadata and extensions.",
  "sources": "Import from importlib.metadata to get package version; static string assignments; dynamic retrieval of package version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of package version flows from importlib.metadata to version variables, then used for documentation version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_version from importlib.metadata is safe; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up configuration variables for Sphinx documentation. It dynamically retrieves the version of the 'typeguard' package via importlib.metadata, which is standard practice. No external input is processed, and no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks. The code is static configuration with minimal dynamic behavior, and no signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with safe use of package version retrieval. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are detected.",
