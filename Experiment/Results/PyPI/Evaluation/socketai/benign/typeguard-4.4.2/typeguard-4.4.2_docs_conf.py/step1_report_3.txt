  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting up project metadata and extensions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib.metadata' and 'packaging.version', and the 'get_version' function call.",
  "sinks": "No sink points that process untrusted data; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "The 'get_version' function retrieves version info for the 'typeguard' package, which is then parsed and assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code only performs static configuration and metadata retrieval without executing external commands or handling untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for version handling, retrieves the installed version of the 'typeguard' package, parses it, and assigns version strings for documentation purposes. It defines various configuration options for Sphinx, including extensions, paths, project metadata, language, and theme settings. The only dynamic operation involves retrieving package version info, which is standard practice and does not involve external input or execution beyond the standard library's safe functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up documentation parameters and retrieves local package metadata.",
