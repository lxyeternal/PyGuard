  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code, a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The only dynamic element is the retrieval of the 'typeguard' package version via `importlib.metadata.get_version`.\n- No untrusted input, external commands, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code is static configuration with safe, standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly retrieves the package version and assigns it to documentation variables. No issues are detected in functionality.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity. The use of `importlib.metadata.get_version` is safe and standard.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risks:** No vulnerabilities or security risks are evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a typical, safe Sphinx configuration file.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are identified.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified because the code performs static configuration and safe package version retrieval.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The only dynamic behavior involves retrieving local package metadata, which is safe.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code's actual operations.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration script with no security concerns.",
