{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and functions for runtime type checking and code instrumentation in Python functions and classes, primarily for development and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads function attributes (__code__, __module__, __qualname__, __closure__, __annotations__, etc.), retrieves source code via inspect.getsource(), and parses ASTs from source.",
  "sinks": "Compiles AST into code objects, creates new functions via FunctionType, and modifies class attributes. No untrusted data is directly sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Source (function attributes and source code) → AST parsing and transformation → Compilation to new code object → Creation of new functions or modification of classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs standard code instrumentation, AST manipulation, and function wrapping. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution beyond standard compile calls.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles source code inspection, AST manipulation, and function wrapping for runtime type checks. It verifies function attributes before instrumentation, parses source code, transforms AST, and reconstructs functions. It uses standard modules and safe practices, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not perform network activity, file system tampering, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The code is complex but appears to be purely for code instrumentation and type checking, without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate utility for runtime type checking and code transformation in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs source inspection, AST modification, and function creation in a safe manner. No malicious or maliciously disguised code detected.",
