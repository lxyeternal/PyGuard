{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions for runtime type checking and function instrumentation in Python, allowing static and dynamic analysis of functions and classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads source code via inspect.getsource, accesses module attributes, and reads function, class, and property attributes such as __code__, __module__, __qualname__, __closure__, __annotations__, __doc__, __defaults__, and __kwdefaults__.",
  "sinks": "The code creates new function objects and closures, potentially executing or manipulating source code or function internals. It also accesses sys.modules and uses compile() and ast.unparse(), which could be sensitive depending on input source code, but generally are standard Python introspection functions.",
  "flows": "Source: inspect.getsource, module attribute access -> AST parsing and transformation -> compile -> find_target_function -> create new code object -> create new function with new code -> set function attributes -> return instrumented function.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs new code objects and closures dynamically without explicit input validation, but this is standard for instrumentation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network connections are present. Use of source code introspection functions like getsource and compile is normal but could be misused if source input is untrusted, though no external source input is provided here. No obfuscation or hidden code techniques detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static code analysis via ast and inspect modules, then reconstructs and recompiles functions with injected type-checking code. It manipulates closures and code objects carefully, without suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. All operations are consistent with a runtime type-checking framework. There are no obfuscated or malicious payloads or external communications. The overall structure and usage of introspection and code transformation functions are standard for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate runtime type-checking and instrumentation utility, with no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It leverages standard Python introspection and code transformation techniques appropriate for its purpose. No security risks or malware signs detected.",
