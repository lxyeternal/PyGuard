  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate runtime type checking utility employing AST manipulation and dynamic compilation. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The low risk score appropriately accounts for the inherent risks of dynamic code execution, assuming source integrity. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the detailed analysis."
