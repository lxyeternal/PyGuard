{
  "purpose": "The code implements runtime type checking functions for Python, validating input types against expected types, including argument, return, send, yield, and variable assignment types.",
  "sources": "Sources include function parameters (value, retval, sendval, yieldval, targets), global variables (__future__, sys, warnings, modules, configuration objects), and local variables (frame, memo, exceptions).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve callbacks (typecheck_fail_callback), warnings (warnings.warn), and exceptions (raising TypeCheckError). No data leaks or external network actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (values, annotations) through check_type_internal, potentially raising exceptions or invoking callbacks, but do not involve external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code features observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Usage of __future__, sys, and standard warnings is normal. The code strictly performs type validation without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code performs runtime type validation by wrapping internal checks with configurable callbacks and warnings. It uses standard Python modules, adheres to expected design patterns, and includes no external network calls, file operations, or malicious constructs. All functions seem focused on type checking logic. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard runtime type checking implementation, designed to enforce type correctness at runtime without malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, data leaks, or supply chain attacks. Overall, it appears to be a safe, well-structured utility for type validation.",
