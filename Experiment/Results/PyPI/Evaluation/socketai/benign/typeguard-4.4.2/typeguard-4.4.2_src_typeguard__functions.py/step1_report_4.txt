{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for runtime type checking and validation of function arguments, return values, variable assignments, and send/yield operations, with support for configuration and custom callbacks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments, variable assignments, return values, send/yield values, and the 'value' parameter in 'check_type'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are callback invocations for type check failures and warnings, but no direct data leaks or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., function arguments, assigned variables) through 'check_type_internal' validations, with failures handled via callbacks or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. Usage of sys._getframe(1) for stack frame inspection is standard in runtime checks, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type validation using internal functions, with configurable behavior and no network or system manipulation. The only potentially sensitive operation is retrieving caller frames for context, which is a standard practice in runtime type checking. The code adheres to typical type enforcement mechanisms and does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard runtime type checking utility with no malicious intent or harmful operations detected. It focuses on type validation and error handling, with no evidence of sabotage, data theft, or malicious system interactions.",
