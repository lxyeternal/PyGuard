{
  "purpose": "The code implements runtime type checking functions to enforce type safety during function calls, return values, generator operations, and variable assignments, using introspection and configurable callbacks or warnings.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, call stack via sys._getframe, configuration objects, imported modules, and internal utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Error raising via exceptions, invoking callbacks, and issuing warnings; no data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated through check_type_internal; upon failure, errors trigger callbacks or exceptions; warnings are issued for non-critical issues.",
  "anomalies": "Standard use of sys._getframe for introspection; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured runtime type validation utility. It uses common Python introspection techniques and standard error handling mechanisms. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or data leaks are evident. The use of sys._getframe is typical for such validation tools, though it can be sensitive in some contexts. The code's purpose aligns with safe, legitimate runtime type enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate runtime type checking library with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. It performs standard validation tasks without external network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, indicating a negligible security risk.",
