{
  "purpose": "Defines custom warning and exception classes for type checking diagnostics, including TypeHintWarning, TypeCheckWarning, InstrumentationWarning, and TypeCheckError, to facilitate debugging and validation within a type enforcement framework.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions, usage of collections.deque for managing error paths, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data handling, no untrusted data processing, no network or file I/O, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process untrusted data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward class definitions with standard Python idioms.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely infrastructural, defining custom warnings and exceptions related to type checking. It employs standard Python constructs, with no dynamic code execution, external data interactions, or suspicious patterns. The use of deque for managing error paths is conventional. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is diagnostic, not operational or system-altering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely infrastructural, and poses no security threat or malicious intent. It contains no obfuscation, backdoors, or data leaks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
