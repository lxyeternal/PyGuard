{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and exception classes related to type checking and instrumentation, possibly for use in a larger type validation framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input reading; only class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for warnings and exceptions, with clear and straightforward implementations. The classes are used for type checking warnings and errors, with no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. No external data input, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The structure and content are typical for a type validation framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on defining custom warning and error classes related to type validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
