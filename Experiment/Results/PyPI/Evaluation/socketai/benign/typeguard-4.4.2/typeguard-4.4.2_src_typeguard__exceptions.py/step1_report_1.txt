{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and exception classes for type checking and instrumentation-related issues in a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, and internally uses collections.deque for managing an error path.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions such as network access, file I/O, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The code defines structure and behavior for exceptions and warnings, with no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated logic, or suspicious constructs are present. All classes are straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom warning and exception classes mainly for type checking purposes. It employs standard Python constructs, with no dynamic code execution or external interactions. The use of deque for managing a path in exceptions is normal. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or malicious patterns are identified. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely for handling type-related warnings and errors within a larger system. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
