  "purpose": "Define custom warning and exception classes for type checking and instrumentation diagnostics.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods, with no external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems or files, and no untrusted data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is present; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; the code appears to be standard class definitions for warnings and exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom warnings (TypeHintWarning, TypeCheckWarning, InstrumentationWarning) and an exception class (TypeCheckError). These classes are used for type checking and instrumentation diagnostics, with no external data input, output, or execution flow involving untrusted sources. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard Python patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions used for type checking warnings and errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
