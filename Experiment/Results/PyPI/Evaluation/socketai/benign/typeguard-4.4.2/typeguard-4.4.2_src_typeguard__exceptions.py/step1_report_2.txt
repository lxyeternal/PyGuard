  "purpose": "Define custom warning and exception classes for type checking and instrumentation issues, primarily for debugging or development purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only internal class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external effect present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from source to sink; classes are purely structural with no runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom warning and exception classes related to type checking, with methods to handle message propagation and path tracking in errors. All classes are standard, well-structured, and do not perform any external or insecure operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely infrastructural, intended for debugging or development purposes without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
