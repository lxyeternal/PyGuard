{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and exception classes related to type checking and instrumentation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code defines classes and methods only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; class methods are simple and do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom warning and exception classes for type checking purposes, including handling of type hint issues, type mismatches, and instrumentation problems. It utilizes standard Python data structures like deque and standard class inheritance. No external data input, no network activity, no cryptographic operations, or file manipulations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears to be a standard utility module for type safety enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom warning and error classes for type checking, with no indications of malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior. It poses no security risk.",
