{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration classes and enums for type checking behavior in a Python type validation library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and conditional import of a local module '_functions'. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or outputted that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up configuration structures and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code primarily consists of enum and dataclass definitions for configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and typing libraries, defines enums for handling forward references and collection checking strategies, and sets up a dataclass for type check configuration. The conditional import hints at modular design but does not introduce any suspicious activity. No user input handling, network operations, or file manipulations are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be intended as part of a larger type checking framework. No obfuscation or malicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a configuration setup for a Python type validation library and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain any code that could be exploited maliciously.",
