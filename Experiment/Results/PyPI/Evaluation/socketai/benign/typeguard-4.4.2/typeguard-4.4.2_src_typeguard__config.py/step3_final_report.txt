{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration enums and a dataclass for a Python type validation library, allowing customization of behavior during type checks.",
  "sources": "Constants and attributes within the module, including enum members and class attributes such as 'forward_ref_policy', 'typecheck_fail_callback', etc.",
  "sinks": "The 'typecheck_fail_callback' attribute, which could invoke external or untrusted code if misconfigured, but defaults to None.",
  "flows": "Potential invocation of 'typecheck_fail_callback' during type check failures, if set by the user, leading to external code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The 'typecheck_fail_callback' attribute is a point of potential concern; otherwise, the code is straightforward with no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines enums and a dataclass for configuration purposes, with no data processing, network activity, or code execution. The only risk lies in the callback attribute, which could invoke external code if misused, but defaults to None and is not invoked here. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for a type validation library, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The potential risk associated with 'typecheck_fail_callback' is minimal given its default value and lack of invocation. All reports correctly assess the code as safe.",
