  "purpose": "Define configuration classes and enums for type checking behavior in a Python type validation library.",
  "sources": "import statements, class definitions, attribute initializations, method implementations",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted input directly or output data",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration values are static and predefined",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets up enums and data classes to configure type checking strategies. It imports standard modules and conditional typing imports for type hints. No user input handling, network activity, or data leaks are present. The methods and attributes are straightforward, and the code appears to be part of a larger type validation library. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup for a type checking library, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
