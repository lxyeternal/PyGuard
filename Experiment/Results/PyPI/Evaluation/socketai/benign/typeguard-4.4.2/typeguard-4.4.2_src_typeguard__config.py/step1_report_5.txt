{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration classes and enums for a type checking library, likely used for runtime type validation and instrumentation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; uses only class definitions, imports, and default values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; mainly static class and enum definitions with default settings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of Python class and enum definitions for configuration purposes. It imports standard modules, defines enums for handling forward references and collection checks, and a dataclass for configuration settings. The code includes default values and documentation strings explaining each setting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely defines configuration options for a type validation system. There is no malware or security risk observed.",
