{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration enums and dataclass for type checking behavior in a Python type validation library.",
  "sources": "Imports and class definitions that set up configuration options; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to security vulnerabilities; the code mainly defines enums and a dataclass.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code establishes default configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums for handling unresolved references and collection checking strategies, as well as a dataclass for configuring type checking behavior. It includes standard Python practices and type annotations. The only configurable attribute 'typecheck_fail_callback' could potentially invoke external code if misused, but here it is set to None by default. No external input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration module for a type validation library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward configuration setup for a type checking library, with no malicious code or security risks present. It simply defines configuration options and defaults.",
