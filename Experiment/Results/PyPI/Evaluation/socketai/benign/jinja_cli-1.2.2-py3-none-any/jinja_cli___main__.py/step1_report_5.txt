  "purpose": "A command line interface tool for rendering Jinja templates with flexible data input sources such as files, environment variables, and command line arguments.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data files (INI, JSON, XML, YAML), command line arguments, standard input",
  "sinks": "Template rendering process (via Jinja2's render method), file output",
  "flows": "Data sources (envs, files, args) are loaded and merged into a single data dictionary, which is then used to render the template via the Jinja2 environment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Uses standard library functions and well-known third-party libraries with no obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads data from multiple sources, including environment variables and files, with support for various formats. It uses Jinja2's templating engine to render templates, either from stdin or from a file. The code employs standard security practices for data handling and templating. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is evident. The code strictly performs data loading, template rendering, and file writing, with no hidden or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate command-line utility for rendering Jinja templates with external data inputs. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Its design is consistent with expected functionality, and there are no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent.",
