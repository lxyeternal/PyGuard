  "purpose": "A command line interface to render Jinja2 templates with data loaded from files, environment variables, and command-line definitions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data files (ini, json, xml, yaml), command-line define arguments, stdin for template input.",
  "sinks": "Rendered output written to stdout or a specified file.",
  "flows": "Data sources (envs, files, defines) merge into a single data dict, which flows into the template.render() call, producing output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads templates from stdin or files, loads data from multiple formats and environment variables, merges data with precedence, and renders templates. It uses standard libraries and handles resources properly. No network calls, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is benign, and no malicious signals are evident. The data loading functions are straightforward, and the template rendering is standard. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are found.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for rendering Jinja2 templates with multiple data sources. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. The code's behavior is safe, and the scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1).",
