  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for rendering Jinja2 templates with multiple data sources. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. The code's behavior is safe, and the scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1)."
