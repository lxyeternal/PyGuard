  "purpose": "A command-line interface for rendering Jinja2 templates with data loaded from various sources such as files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, file inputs (INI, JSON, XML, YAML), stdin for template input.",
  "sinks": "Template rendering (f.template.render(data)), file output, stdout.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from environment variables, files, and command-line arguments; combined into a data dictionary; then passed to Jinja2 template rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious backdoors; use of multiple data formats with no validation; no malicious code injection detected; no network connections or data exfiltration observed; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a flexible mechanism to load data from multiple sources and formats, then render a Jinja2 template with this data. It uses standard libraries and well-known third-party modules (jinja2, xmltodict, yaml). No signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The code handles data loading and template rendering securely, with no apparent injection points beyond normal template rendering. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic, nor does it perform any harmful actions. The use of environment variables and file inputs is typical for configuration management, with no indications of malicious manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for template rendering without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
