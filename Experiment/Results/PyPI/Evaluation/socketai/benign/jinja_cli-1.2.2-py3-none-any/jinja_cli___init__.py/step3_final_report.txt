  "purpose": "Shebang line indicating Python 3 interpreter; no additional code or logic present.",
  "sources": "None; code contains only a shebang line with no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, processing, or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow exists in the minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code beyond shebang line; no suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) with no executable logic, variables, functions, or data handling. All reports correctly identify the minimal and benign nature of this snippet. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. Confidence in benignity is high (1.0), and scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. Given the simplicity, no anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of a shebang line. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
