  "purpose": "No purpose can be determined as the code is an empty script with only a shebang line.",

  "anomalies": "Absence of code; only a shebang line without executable content.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a shebang line indicating it should be run with Python 3, but no actual code follows. As such, there are no sources, sinks, data flows, or suspicious behavior to analyze. The script is essentially empty and does not perform any operations, malicious or otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The script is an empty template with no executable code, and therefore contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies.",
