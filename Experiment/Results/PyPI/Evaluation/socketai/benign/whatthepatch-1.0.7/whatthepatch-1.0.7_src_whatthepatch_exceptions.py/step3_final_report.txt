  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for patching and parsing errors in a structured error handling system.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and inheritance hierarchy; no external data inputs or outputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely class definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, with constructors setting attributes and calling superclass constructors. There are no external data inputs, network operations, code execution, or data leaks. The structure is standard, with no anomalies or malicious patterns. The code is clear, simple, and serves error handling purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for patching and parsing errors. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
