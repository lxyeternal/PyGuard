  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for patch application and parsing errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, subclassing built-in exceptions and adding minimal custom attributes. There are no external data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present. The exception hierarchy appears standard and intended for error handling within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
