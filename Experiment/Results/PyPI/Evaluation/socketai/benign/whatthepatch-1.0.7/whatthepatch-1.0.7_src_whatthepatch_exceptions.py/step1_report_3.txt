{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for patch application and parsing errors, including specific exceptions for hunks and subprocess failures.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constructors, with no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks; only class inheritance and initialization occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears straightforward and conventional, with clear exception class hierarchy.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes used for handling patch application errors. Each class is designed to represent specific error types, with some constructors passing messages and additional data (e.g., hunk number, process return code). There are no signs of input handling, data leaks, or malicious logic. The class design and inheritance are standard for exception management in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, conventional set of custom exception class definitions for a patching system. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate error handling code with no security concerns.",
