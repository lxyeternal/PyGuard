{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for patch application and parsing errors, with some hierarchy and additional attributes.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__ methods) and inheritance structures; no external data input or output handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or effect; no operations involving external systems or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with message and optional data; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with inheritance to categorize patch and parsing errors. The classes include mechanisms for passing messages and optional data (like 'hunk' and 'code'). There are no external data reads, network operations, or code execution features. The use of multiple inheritance is clear and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The purpose appears to be structured error handling within a patch application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes without any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It is intended for structured error reporting in a patching or parsing system, with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
