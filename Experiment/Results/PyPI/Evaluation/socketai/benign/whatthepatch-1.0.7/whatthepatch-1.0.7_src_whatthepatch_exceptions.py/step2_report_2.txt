  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to patching and parsing.\n   - No external data handling, no input/output operations, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no code execution or external interactions are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is purely definitional with no security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The detailed analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), which is justified.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only defining exception classes with no malicious payload, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Remarks:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and serves its purpose for structured error handling within a patching system. No further security concerns are identified.",
