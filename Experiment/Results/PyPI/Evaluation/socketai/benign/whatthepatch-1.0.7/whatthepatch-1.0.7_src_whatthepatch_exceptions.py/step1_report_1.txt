  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for patch application and parsing errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is purely exception class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly defines exception classes without any unusual or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions. It includes specific handling for 'hunk' information in exceptions related to patching operations. The constructors simply set attributes and call superclass constructors, with no data manipulation, external input, or insecure behavior present. The structure and logic are straightforward, typical for error handling in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard class definitions for custom exceptions related to patching processes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
