  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for patch application and parsing errors",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading present in this code)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data output or external system interaction present)",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flows involving sources and sinks)",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple inheritance in exception classes, no suspicious or malicious code present, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to patch application processes. It uses inheritance to create a hierarchy of exception classes with descriptive constructors. There are no data inputs, no external system interactions, no code execution beyond standard exception handling, and no signs of malicious behavior. The purpose appears to be structured error handling within a larger patch management system. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, implementing custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not interact with external systems or process untrusted data. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
