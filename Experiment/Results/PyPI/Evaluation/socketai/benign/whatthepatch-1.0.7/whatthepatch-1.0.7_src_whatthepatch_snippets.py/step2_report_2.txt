  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code comprises utility functions: `remove`, `findall_regex`, `split_by_regex`, and `which`.\n- All functions use standard Python libraries (`os`, `shutil`, `re`) and perform expected operations.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The functions interact with the filesystem, environment variables, and regex matching, which are typical for utility scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Utility functions for filesystem, regex list processing, executable resolution.\n- No suspicious activity or malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis is accurate; the code is benign.\n- The confidence is high (0.9), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scoring and reasoning are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar functions as above, with detailed analysis.\n- No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, perhaps considering filesystem operations)\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The functions are standard and safe.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable, given that file deletion functions could be misused if called with untrusted input, but on their own, they are benign.\n- Malware score remains 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning and scoring are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Utility functions similar to previous reports.\n- No suspicious or malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis is accurate.\n- The functions are safe; no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar utility functions.\n- Emphasizes standard library usage.\n- No malicious behavior observed.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is sound.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 might be slightly high given the functions' benign nature, but it accounts for potential misuse if inputs are untrusted.\n- Malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring and analysis are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Utility functions, with mention of potential risks if paths are controlled by an attacker.\n- No actual malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (considering possible misuse of filesystem operations)\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report correctly notes that if inputs are untrusted, file deletion or path resolution could be misused.\n- The malware score remains 0, which is correct; no malware is present.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting potential for misuse in untrusted contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The minor security risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) are justified considering the functions' potential misuse in untrusted scenarios, but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n\n**Risk score:** Based on the reports, a conservative estimate would be around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to filesystem operations and environment variable access, which could be misused if inputs are malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a set of standard utility functions with no malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
