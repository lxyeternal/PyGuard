  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for file removal, regex-based list processing, and executable path searching.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists, os.path.isdir, os.remove, regex.match, os.environ['PATH'], os.path.isfile, os.access",
  "sinks": "os.remove, rmtree, os.access",
  "flows": "Checks if path exists -> removes file or directory; matches regex against list items -> splits list; searches PATH environment variable for executable -> returns path if found",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The functions are straightforward utilities without hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions: 'remove' safely deletes files or directories; 'findall_regex' locates indices in a list matching a regex; 'split_by_regex' splits a list based on regex matches; 'which' mimics Unix 'which' command to find an executable in PATH. All functions use standard library modules and functions without obfuscation or malicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling, and no suspicious external connections or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides common utility functions without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. No security risks identified; functions are safe and standard.",
