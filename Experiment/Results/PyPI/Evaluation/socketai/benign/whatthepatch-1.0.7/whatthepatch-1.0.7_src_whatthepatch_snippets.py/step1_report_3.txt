  "sources": "os.environ['PATH'], input parameters to functions (path, items, regex, program)",
  "sinks": "os.remove, rmtree, os.path.isfile, os.access, os.path.join",
  "flows": "Input paths -> is_exe checks -> returns executable path or None",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The script contains straightforward utility functions. 'remove' deletes files/directories, 'findall_regex' searches list items for regex matches, 'split_by_regex' splits lists based on regex matches, 'which' locates an executable in PATH. All functions use standard library calls and have no network activity or data leakage mechanisms. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions without malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard file and process checks without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
