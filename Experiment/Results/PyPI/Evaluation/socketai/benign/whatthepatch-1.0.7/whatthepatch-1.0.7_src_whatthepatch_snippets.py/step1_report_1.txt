  "purpose": "Utility functions for file system operations, regex-based list processing, and executable path resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'PATH' and checks for file existence and executability.",
  "sinks": "None directly, but 'os.remove' and 'rmtree' perform file deletion, which could be misused if called maliciously.",
  "flows": "The 'which' function reads 'PATH' environment variable and checks for executable files; 'remove' deletes files or directories based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or malicious code; functions are straightforward. No suspicious obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'remove' deletes files/directories, 'findall_regex' searches list items with regex, 'split_by_regex' splits list based on regex matches, and 'which' finds an executable in system PATH. All functions operate in expected ways without malicious intent. The 'which' function accesses environment variables and checks filesystem permissions, which is standard for such utility functions. No anomalous or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for filesystem and process operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'os' and 'shutil' functions is standard and safe within the context. Overall, no malware or malicious behavior is present.",
