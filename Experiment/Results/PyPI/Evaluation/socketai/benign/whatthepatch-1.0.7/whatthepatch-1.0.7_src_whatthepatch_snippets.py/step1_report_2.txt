  "purpose": "Utility functions for file operations, regex-based list splitting, and locating executable files in system PATH.",
  "sources": "Reading from the filesystem (os.path.exists, os.path.isfile, os.access), environment variables (os.environ['PATH']), regex matching on list items.",
  "sinks": "os.remove and shutil.rmtree potentially delete files or directories; no direct untrusted data sinks leading to security vulnerabilities identified.",
  "flows": "Input data from filesystem checks, environment variables, and regex matches flow into deletion or path resolution functions without external untrusted input manipulation leading to malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code segments; functions perform standard system and string operations. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions: 'remove' deletes files or directories, 'findall_regex' locates regex matches within a list, 'split_by_regex' splits a list based on regex match indices, and 'which' finds an executable in system PATH. All functions perform standard, well-understood operations. No indications of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The environment variable usage in 'which' is typical for locating executables. Overall, the code appears to be benign, focusing on filesystem and process utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard utility functions with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected. It is safe and does not exhibit security risks.",
