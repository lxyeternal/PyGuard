  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk scores (around 0.1 to 0.2) are justified considering potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but do not reflect actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and standard."
