  "purpose": "Utility functions for filesystem manipulation, regex-based list processing, and executable path resolution.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks (os.path.exists, os.path.isfile), environment variables (os.environ), regex matching (regex.match), input lists.",
  "sinks": "File deletion (rmtree, os.remove), path resolution (os.path.join), environment variable access, regex matching results.",
  "flows": "Input data from filesystem, environment variables, and input lists flow through functions to perform file operations, regex matching, and path resolution; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. Functions are straightforward utility implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions: 'remove' deletes files/directories based on path; 'findall_regex' searches for regex matches in list items; 'split_by_regex' partitions lists based on regex matches; 'which' locates executable files in PATH. All functions use standard libraries and perform expected operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. While the 'remove' function could be misused if given malicious input, this is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's overall behavior is benign, with no network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The potential security concern is the misuse of filesystem operations if inputs are untrusted, but this is a known risk for utility functions, not an inherent vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk scores (around 0.1 to 0.2) are justified considering potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but do not reflect actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
