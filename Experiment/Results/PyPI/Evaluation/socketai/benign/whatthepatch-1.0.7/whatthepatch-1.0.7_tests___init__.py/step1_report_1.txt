  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external systems, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; no explicit input sources identified in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output through network connections, file writes, or external system calls; specific sinks not explicitly evident without more code context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks like network or file operations; detailed flow analysis limited due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. The code uses standard libraries without unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily straightforward, with normal use of Python constructs. No signs of malicious activity such as dynamic code execution, secret exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Absence of explicit network activity or data leakage points. The lack of context limits a full assessment, but based on available code, no malicious intent or dangerous security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks. Confidence in this assessment is high, but additional context could provide further assurance.",
