{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that imports modules and performs basic operations, likely intended for general functionality.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and possibly function parameters or user inputs, although no explicit input functions are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) to output or system calls, but no such flows are clearly evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code contains basic module imports and simple operations without any complex or hidden logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The absence of obfuscation, suspicious imports, or unusual code flow suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It seems to serve a standard purpose without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
