  "purpose": "This code appears to define a module that exports functions for parsing patches and applying diffs, likely for file or data modifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.patch' and '.apply', which are internal to the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from internal modules and defines an export list. It contains no input handling, no external network interactions, and no suspicious code behavior. The presence of only import statements and an __all__ declaration indicates a typical module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this limited snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple module interface definition with no embedded malicious code or vulnerabilities.",
