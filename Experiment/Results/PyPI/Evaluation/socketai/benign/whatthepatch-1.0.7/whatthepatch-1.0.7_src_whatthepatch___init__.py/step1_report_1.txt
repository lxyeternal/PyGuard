{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an interface for patch parsing and application functions, likely part of a larger software project handling diffs or patches.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; it imports functions from local modules (.patch and .apply).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code segment; it only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which controls module exports. There are no runtime operations, user inputs, external data processing, or system interactions. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent based on this small snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply exposes functions from internal modules for external use.",
