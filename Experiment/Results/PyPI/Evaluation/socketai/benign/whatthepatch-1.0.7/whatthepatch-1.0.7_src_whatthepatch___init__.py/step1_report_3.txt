  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports functions from internal submodules for patch parsing and applying diffs, and exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules and declares them in __all__ for public access, serving as a simple module interface setup. No code execution, data processing, or external interaction is present. It appears standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module interface definition without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data handling or system interactions that could pose security threats.",
