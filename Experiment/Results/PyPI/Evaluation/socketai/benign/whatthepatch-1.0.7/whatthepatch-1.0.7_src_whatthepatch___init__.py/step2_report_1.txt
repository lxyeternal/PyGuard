  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external data handling, or system interactions are visible.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a simple module interface setup, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly note the absence of data flows, external interactions, or suspicious patterns.\n- No false claims or logical errors are evident.\n- The confidence levels are uniformly high (1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The `confidence` scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code is purely an interface with no logic, no data handling, and no external interactions, the security risk is negligible.\n- The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n- Therefore, the overall risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to it.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- All reports are cautious and accurate, avoiding assumptions beyond the code snippet.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are unjustified.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the absence of any malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify this code as a standard module interface with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
