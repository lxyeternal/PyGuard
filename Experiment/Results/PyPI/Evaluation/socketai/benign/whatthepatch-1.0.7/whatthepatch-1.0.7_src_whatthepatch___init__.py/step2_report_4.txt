  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal module that imports functions from internal modules (.patch and .apply) and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No external data, user input, network activity, or runtime logic is present.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are mentioned.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippet itself is straightforward: it imports two functions and defines an export list.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- Since the code is purely an interface, it does not contain logic that could be malicious; however, the imported modules (`.patch` and `.apply`) are internal and not shown. These modules could potentially contain vulnerabilities or malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, we cannot assess that.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The risk score is also at 0, which is justified.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- The scores seem reasonable given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n- If I were to suggest any change, it would be to maintain the current scores unless further context about the internal modules indicates otherwise.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module interface with no malicious or security issues.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis provided in the reports.",
