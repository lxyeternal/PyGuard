{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface that imports specific functions from internal modules and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports functions from local modules (.patch and .apply).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports functions from internal modules and declares an export list. It contains no logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments, and there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module interface with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
