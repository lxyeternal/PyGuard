Its main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external 'patch' utility and the environment, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious or the environment is compromised. The current scores are appropriate, reflecting low malware likelihood and minimal risk primarily due to external utility reliance. Proper validation, environment hardening, and trust in external tools are recommended for secure deployment."

The minor security risk scores (around 0.1 to 0.2) are justified considering potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but do not reflect actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and standard."

The handling of binary data introduces minor security considerations but does not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, and the code is safe for supply chain use, assuming external validation of inputs."

Report 4's elevated scores are justified if the described suspicious patterns are confirmed. Adjustments should be made if actual code lacks such patterns. Overall, the security assessment indicates low risk for most, with a potential moderate risk in Report 4 depending on code specifics."
