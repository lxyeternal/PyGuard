  "purpose": "Define a Django model to log access attempts, including user information, IP, headers, and attempt status.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, and attempt_time fields, which are populated from HTTP request data and system timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string formatting in __str__ method, which outputs model data; no other direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request input fields (user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info) into the model fields, and ultimately into the __str__ method output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or hidden malicious payloads detected. The code uses standard Django ORM practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model for logging access attempts with typical fields capturing request metadata and attempt details. It includes proper field types and a string representation method. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, insecure practices, or obfuscated code are present. Usage of verbose_name and auto_now_add indicates standard Django conventions. No external inputs are processed beyond ORM field assignments, and no untrusted data handling or unsafe operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward Django model for logging access attempts without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses standard practices and does not exhibit signs of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
