  "sources": "Data inputs include user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, attempt_time, login_valid.",
  "sinks": "Potential data display or storage; no direct data leakage or external effect evident from this code.",
  "flows": "Input data is stored in model fields; no data flows to external systems or outputs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code appears to follow standard Django model practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model with fields for logging access attempts, including user agent, IP address, username, HTTP accept header, request path, attempt time, and login success status. All fields are typical for logging purposes, with no suspicious or malicious code detected. The use of auto_now_add for timestamp and ordering is standard. The __str__ method provides a readable string representation. No external data interactions, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django model for logging access attempts with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
