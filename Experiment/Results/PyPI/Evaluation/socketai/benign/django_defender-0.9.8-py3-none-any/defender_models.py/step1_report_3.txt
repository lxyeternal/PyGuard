  "purpose": "Define a Django model for logging access attempts, including user agent, IP address, username, HTTP accept header, path, timestamp, and login validity.",
  "sources": "None explicitly read input; model fields are static definitions. However, this model would store data received via user input or system logs.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in database; potential for retrieving and displaying sensitive information such as IP address, username, or headers.",
  "flows": "Input data from user requests or logs is saved into model fields; no explicit data flow, but data persistence occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The __str__ method formats output for display, no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model class with several character and boolean fields, a timestamp, and ordering. It includes a string representation method. No data processing, external calls, or user input handling is shown. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices. The code appears to be a standard logging model with no malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django model for logging access attempts. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or obfuscated code. No security issues are evident.",
