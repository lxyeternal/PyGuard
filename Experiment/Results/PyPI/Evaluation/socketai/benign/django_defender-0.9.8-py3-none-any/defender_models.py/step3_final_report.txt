  "purpose": "Django model for logging access attempts, capturing user agent, IP, username, HTTP headers, path, timestamp, and login success status.",
  "sources": "Model fields: user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, attempt_time, login_valid",
  "sinks": "None; data is stored in database, no external data flows or outputs",
  "flows": "Data is stored upon access attempt; no external flows or untrusted data processing beyond storage",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward model",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django ORM model with no dynamic code, external calls, or obfuscation. It simply logs access attempts with no processing of untrusted data in a risky manner. The __str__ method formats stored data for display. No security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate; the minimal risk accounts for potential sensitive data exposure but no active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django logging model with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the scores are consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
