  "purpose": "Define a Django model for logging access attempts including user agent, IP, username, HTTP accept header, path info, attempt time, and login validity.",
  "sources": "Data is read from model fields: user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, attempt_time, login_valid.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only defines a data model without external output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (model fields) through model methods; no external data flow or external execution pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The __str__ method is straightforward, providing formatted string output.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django ORM model to log access attempts. All fields are standard Django model fields, with no user input processing or dynamic code execution. The __str__ method formats stored data for display. No external calls, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The model appears to be used for audit or security logging without any malicious intent or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django model for logging access attempts with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as a data schema without external threats or malicious logic.",
