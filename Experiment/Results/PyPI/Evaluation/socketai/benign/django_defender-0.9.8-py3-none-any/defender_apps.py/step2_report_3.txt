  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard Django AppConfig subclass setting app name and default auto field.\n- No external data handling, no network calls, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it's a simple Django configuration class.\n- No issues or malicious activity are present in the code.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reports' reasoning or summaries.\n- The logic is sound; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1. This small value might be overly cautious, but not unreasonable, given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is entirely static, with no external inputs or dynamic behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly cautious but acceptable, given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n- Obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard Django application configuration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
