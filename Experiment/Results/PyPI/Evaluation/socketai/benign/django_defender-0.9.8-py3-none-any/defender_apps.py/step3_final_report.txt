  "purpose": "Defines a Django AppConfig subclass setting the app name and default auto field.",
  "sources": "Import of django.apps, class definition, assignment of name and default_auto_field attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "Static configuration; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward Django configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static Django AppConfig subclass with no external data handling, network calls, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The only minor discrepancy is a security risk score of 0.1 in one report, which is unjustified given the code's simplicity. Therefore, the overall assessment is that the code poses no security threat, and all scores should reflect zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Django configuration class with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate; the minimal security risk score of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
