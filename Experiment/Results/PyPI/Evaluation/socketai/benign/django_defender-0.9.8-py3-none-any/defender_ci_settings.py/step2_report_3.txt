  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. Configuration appears standard.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious activity; minimal security risk given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code or backdoors. Use of environment variables and in-memory broker is typical for testing.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, just development defaults.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No suspicious code. Default SECRET_KEY is insecure but not malicious.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The default SECRET_KEY 'too-secret-for-test' is insecure for production but acceptable in testing environments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malware, only a minor security concern about default secret.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code; configuration is standard.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, configuration is safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code. The only concern is the default SECRET_KEY, which is insecure but not malicious.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The default SECRET_KEY 'too-secret-for-test' is insecure for production but acceptable for testing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malware, only a configuration concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly higher (0.2) in some reports due to default SECRET_KEY; this is acceptable given the testing context, but in production, it should be overridden.\n\n**My independent estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward configuration.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — primarily due to default secrets and local testing configurations, not actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious code.\n- Configuration is standard for development/testing environments.\n- The only minor concern is the insecure default SECRET_KEY, which is a common best practice warning but not a security breach.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — reflecting minor security concern about default secrets, but no real threat.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is required.",
