  "purpose": "Configuration script for a Django project with Celery, defining database, cache, middleware, installed apps, templates, secrets, and task queue settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY' for secret retrieval; static strings for Redis URLs, Celery broker, and Django settings module.",
  "sinks": "Use of environment variable for SECRET_KEY; hardcoded Redis URLs; setting of Celery broker URL; Django settings module environment variable.",
  "flows": "SECRET_KEY sourced from environment variable; Celery and Redis configuration data flow; environment variable influencing secret and settings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials beyond defaults; use of 'memory' broker for Celery is typical for testing; environment variables properly used for secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration-oriented, setting up Django and Celery environments. It uses environment variables to avoid hardcoding secrets, which is good practice. Redis URLs and Celery broker settings are standard for test environments. No code executes untrusted input, performs network connections outside the configured services, or includes malicious code snippets. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe configuration for a Django project with Celery in a testing environment. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. All sensitive data is handled appropriately, and the logic is straightforward.",
