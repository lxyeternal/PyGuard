  "purpose": "Configuration script for a Django project with Celery integration, setting up database, cache, middleware, installed apps, templates, secret key, and task queue settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variable for SECRET_KEY, hardcoded Redis URL (DEFENDER_REDIS_URL), environment variable for DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, and imported modules (os, django, celery).",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used for secret management, Celery configuration, and Redis URL; usage of external dependencies such as Redis and Celery that interact with network services.",
  "flows": "Secret key retrieved from environment variable; Redis URL used for cache and redis-related configurations; Celery loads settings from Django config; environment variables influence settings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.environ.get' for SECRET_KEY with a default value; presence of 'DEFENDER_REDIS_URL' pointing to localhost; use of in-memory broker for Celery, which is typical for testing, not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials apart from default secret key.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up Django settings, including database, cache, middleware, installed apps, and task queue configurations. It retrieves the SECRET_KEY from environment variables, which is good practice, though it has a default insecure value ('too-secret-for-test') for testing. Redis URL is also configured via a variable, but pointing to localhost is typical for development/testing. Celery uses in-memory broker suitable for testing, reducing security risks. No suspicious code patterns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated logic are present. No data leaks or malware behavior identified. The code appears standard and safe for its intended development/testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for a Django project with Celery, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks beyond typical development defaults. The use of environment variables for secrets is appropriate, and no suspicious external communications or backdoors are evident.",
