{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django project with Celery, Redis, and defender security app",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY', redis URL, and potentially untrusted environment variables",
  "sinks": "Environment variables, Redis URL, Celery broker URL, Django secret key",
  "flows": "Environment variables → SECRET_KEY; environment or code configurations → Redis and Celery URL settings",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for SECRET_KEY, but a default insecure value 'too-secret-for-test' suggests potential misconfiguration; no hardcoded credentials other than default secret; Redis URL is standard; no suspicious code or backdoors evident",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines settings for Django, Celery, and defender. It uses environment variables for sensitive data like SECRET_KEY, which is good practice, though it defaults to a weak string. Redis and Celery configurations are standard and do not contain suspicious elements. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present other than the default SECRET_KEY. The code does not perform any input/output operations, network connections, or dynamic code execution that could be malicious. All dependencies are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward configuration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration script for a Django project with Celery and defender security app. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The only minor concern is the default SECRET_KEY value, which should be set securely in production, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
