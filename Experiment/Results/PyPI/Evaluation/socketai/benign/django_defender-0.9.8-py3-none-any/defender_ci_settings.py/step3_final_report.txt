{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a configuration setup for a Django project utilizing Celery and Redis, primarily intended for testing or development environments with in-memory or local services.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for SECRET_KEY, local Redis server, in-memory Celery broker, and project settings files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; environment variables are used for secrets, and local services are configured for testing.",
  "flows": "Environment variable SECRET_KEY flows into Django settings; Redis and Celery configurations are local and static, with no external data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default SECRET_KEY 'too-secret-for-test' which is insecure for production but common in testing; no suspicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward configuration for a Django project with Celery and Redis, with environment variables used for secrets. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the default SECRET_KEY, which is acceptable in a testing context but should be overridden in production. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor concern about default secrets. The code does not perform any network operations beyond local Redis and Celery setup, and there are no suspicious data flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration setup for testing environments. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, with a minor security concern regarding the default SECRET_KEY. Overall, the supply chain security posture is safe, and no immediate issues are present.",
