  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report states no malicious or suspicious code is detected. The code is standard configuration, reading SECRET_KEY from env, with Redis and Celery set to localhost.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No obvious logical errors or security flaws. The \"malware\" score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — reasonable.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — acceptable given the environment is development/testing.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code, just configuration.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** The use of 'os.environ.get' with a default insecure SECRET_KEY ('too-secret-for-test') is noted, but this is common in testing environments.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable for a testing setup.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code, only configuration.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** The default SECRET_KEY is insecure, but again, acceptable for testing.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — aligns with the default secret and local Redis.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Reasoning is sound; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious code; standard configuration.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** The use of 'memory' broker and default SECRET_KEY are typical for testing, not production.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0 — justified, as no real security flaws are present in this testing setup.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; configuration for testing.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** The default SECRET_KEY is insecure but expected in testing environments.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — consistent with default secret and local Redis.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's logic is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, backdoor, or suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as no obfuscation or code concealment is present.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) due to default insecure SECRET_KEY and local testing configurations, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward configuration.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — considering default secrets and local-only configurations, this is a reasonable risk level for testing environments.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is standard configuration for development/testing, with no malicious intent.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.  \n- No evidence of supply chain or security attack detected.",
