{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django application integrated with Celery, defining database, cache, middleware, installed apps, templates, secrets, and task queue settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variable for SECRET_KEY, hardcoded Redis URLs, Celery configuration, and potentially sensitive settings like SECRET_KEY.",
  "sinks": "Use of SECRET_KEY and environment variables, Redis URLs, and Celery settings could be sensitive if exposed or misused.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and hardcoded secrets flow into application security-sensitive configurations, but no data flows from untrusted sources to vulnerable sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY defaults to a static value ('too-secret-for-test') if environment variable is absent, which is insecure in production. Use of 'memory' broker for Celery indicates testing or development setup; in production, this could be a concern if misconfigured.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration for Django, Celery, and related components. It does not contain any code that processes untrusted input or executes dynamic code. The only potential security concern is the default SECRET_KEY, which is insecure for production but typical for testing environments. Redis URLs and Celery broker settings are standard and do not pose direct threats. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscation or malware indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for a Django and Celery environment intended for development or testing. The only notable security concern is the default SECRET_KEY, which should be overridden in production. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
