  "purpose": "Configuration for testing Django with Celery and Defender, using in-memory databases and mock Redis.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for SECRET_KEY, in-memory database, mock Redis, default URLs for Celery broker.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and in-memory services are used for configuration; no data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default SECRET_KEY 'too-secret-for-test' and in-memory backends, which are insecure for production but typical for testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django and Celery configuration intended solely for testing purposes. It employs environment variables for secrets, with defaults suitable for non-production use. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The use of in-memory databases and mock Redis indicates a testing environment. Scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No obfuscation or malicious intent is detected. The environment setup is standard and safe for testing, with no vulnerabilities or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is low and scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
