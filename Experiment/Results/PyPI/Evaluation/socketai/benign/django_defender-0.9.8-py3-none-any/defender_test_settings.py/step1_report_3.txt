  "purpose": "Configure Django project with Celery for background task processing, including database, middleware, and app settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SECRET_KEY), imported modules (os, django, celery), hardcoded URLs and settings.",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get, Celery configuration, database connection strings.",
  "flows": "Environment variable SECRET_KEY influences SECRET_KEY; Celery uses in-memory broker; settings are loaded from environment and code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of in-memory Redis and Celery broker for testing; SECRET_KEY defaults to a hardcoded string; minimal security risk in the context.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Django project with Celery, with configurations for middleware, installed apps, templates, and database. The SECRET_KEY is obtained from an environment variable with a fallback value, which is common in testing but not secure for production. Celery is configured to use an in-memory broker, indicating a test environment. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected. Usage of environment variables and mock Redis suggests a development/testing context rather than production. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration script for a Django project with Celery, intended for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The use of default secrets and in-memory services is appropriate for testing but should be revised for production. Overall, the code is benign.",
