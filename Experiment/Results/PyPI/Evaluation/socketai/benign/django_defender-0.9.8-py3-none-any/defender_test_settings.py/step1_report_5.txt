{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Django project with Celery for background task processing, primarily for testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'SECRET_KEY', imports os, django, and celery modules, and retrieves environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables for SECRET_KEY and DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, and configures Celery broker URL with 'memory://'.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY' influences SECRET_KEY setting; 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' influences Django configuration; Celery broker URL determines task backend.",
  "anomalies": "Use of in-memory database and Redis mock for testing is typical; however, SECRET_KEY defaulting to 'too-secret-for-test' could be insecure if used in production, but acceptable here for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes Django settings and Celery configuration for testing with in-memory database and mock Redis. It reads environment variables for secrets but defaults to non-secure values suitable for testing. No hardcoded credentials or secrets other than the default SECRET_KEY are present. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is evident; no data leaks or system manipulations are present. The code appears to be a standard test setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test configuration for Django and Celery with no evidence of malicious behavior. The use of default secrets and in-memory setups is appropriate for testing environments but should be changed before production deployment.",
