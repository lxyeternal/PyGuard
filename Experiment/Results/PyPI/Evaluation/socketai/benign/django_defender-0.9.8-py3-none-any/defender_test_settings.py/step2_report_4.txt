  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard Django + Celery test setup, with in-memory database and mock Redis. It uses environment variables for SECRET_KEY, defaulting to a non-secret string, which is acceptable for testing. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9. These seem reasonable.\n- **Risk justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, a low security risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on configuration details. The use of a hardcoded fallback SECRET_KEY is noted, but acceptable in testing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9. These are consistent.\n- **Risk justification:** No malicious activity; in-memory backends and mock Redis reduce risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard test configuration. The fallback SECRET_KEY is insecure for production but acceptable here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on testing environment. No suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9. Slightly lower securityRisk score, which is justified given the benign setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard testing configuration with environment variables and in-memory backends.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9. Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, indicating clear code.\n- **Risk scores:** Low (around 0.1-0.2), appropriate for testing environments with default secrets and in-memory services.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), given the consistent benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard test setup for Django + Celery with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since it's a testing setup with default secrets, but no real security risk in this context)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified based on the code. No further action needed.",
