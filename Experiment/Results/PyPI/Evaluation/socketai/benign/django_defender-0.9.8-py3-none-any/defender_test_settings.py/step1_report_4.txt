  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django application with Celery integration, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY', os.environ, Django settings, Celery configuration.",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY'), Celery app configuration, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Secret key from environment → Django settings; Environment variables → app configuration; Celery settings from Django config.",
  "anomalies": "Use of in-memory database and mock Redis for testing, which are typical for test environments; no hardcoded credentials or secrets other than default secret key; use of environment variable with default (not necessarily malicious).",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django and Celery setup for testing with in-memory backends and mock Redis, indicating a development/test environment. The 'SECRET_KEY' is fetched from environment variables with a default, which is common and not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The configuration appears intended solely for local or testing purposes. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test environment configuration for Django and Celery, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors, and the use of mock backends further supports a safe testing setup.",
