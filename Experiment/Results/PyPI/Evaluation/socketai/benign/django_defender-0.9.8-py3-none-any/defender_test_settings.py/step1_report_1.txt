{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django project with Celery task queue and Defender security app, primarily for testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY', static configuration parameters, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Celery app initialization, environment variables setting, Celery configuration, Django settings import.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and settings influence Celery and Django behavior; imported modules contribute to runtime configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of in-memory database and mock Redis for testing; minimal code obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code. The code is standard Django and Celery setup with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django environment with in-memory database and mock Redis for testing purposes, and initializes Celery with in-memory broker. It retrieves SECRET_KEY from environment variables, which is a standard practice for security. No hardcoded secrets other than the default 'too-secret-for-test'. No code injection, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The configuration appears typical for a test environment, with no malicious or backdoor patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for a Django project with Celery, intended for testing. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. It uses typical practices such as environment variables for secrets and in-memory services for testing, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
