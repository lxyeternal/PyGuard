  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code behavior.\n\n**Step 1: Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**\n\n- All reports indicate that the code stores login attempts and retrieves counts based on filters, using standard Django ORM queries.\n- No reports mention any code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- Exception handling appears to be for input validation, not malicious purposes.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident.\n\n**Step 2: Logical and Structural Review**\n\n- The code is straightforward, relying on configuration flags to control behavior.\n- The filtering logic is standard, with conditional checks for IP and username lockouts.\n- The calculations (e.g., dividing count by failure limit) are typical for lockout mechanisms.\n- Exception raising for invalid states is a safeguard, not malicious.\n\n**Step 3: Scoring Justification**\n\n- Malware Score: Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated Score: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- Security Risk: Generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard login attempt tracking, which is a common security practice.\n\n**Step 4: Potential Flaws or Concerns**\n\n- The only notable point is the exception raised when none of the filtering conditions are met. While this might be restrictive, it is a safeguard, not malicious.\n- No evidence suggests the code could be exploited maliciously.\n\n**Step 5: Recommendations for Score Adjustments**\n\n- The scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n- Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is present, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, considering the code's purpose.\n\n**Step 6: Final Assessment**\n\n- The code functions as a typical login attempt tracker with configurable lockout policies.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The logic is sound, and the code adheres to standard security practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Final Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** Approximately 0.1–0.2, consistent with the reports, indicating low security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, security-focused implementation for login attempt tracking and lockout enforcement. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
