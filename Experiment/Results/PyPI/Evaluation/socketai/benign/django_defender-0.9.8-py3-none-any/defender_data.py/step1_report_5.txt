{
  "purpose": "This code manages and retrieves login attempt data for user authentication security, specifically storing attempts and calculating lockout thresholds.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters from the 'config' module, and accesses the database via AccessAttempt model queries. It also reads input parameters such as ip_address and username.",
  "sinks": "Database queries via AccessAttempt.objects.filter() and AccessAttempt.objects.create() are the main sinks. These could be misused if untrusted data is involved in query filters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (ip_address, username) flow into query filters, influencing database retrievals. Configuration parameters guide the filtering logic and failure limits.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or misleading dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation for managing login attempt tracking and lockout logic. It uses configuration settings to determine behavior, constructs database queries based on input parameters, and handles different lockout policies. There are no signs of malicious logic or obfuscation. The use of database filters and configuration-based logic is standard. No data exfiltration, system command execution, or malicious backdoors are evident. The code primarily operates within expected boundaries for security features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component for security enforcement in a Django application, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It relies on external configuration and database access for its core functionality. Overall, the code is well-structured and does not show signs of security risks or malware.",
