  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation for logging login attempts and calculating lockouts.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malware are evident.\n- The code relies on configuration flags to control behavior, which is typical.\n- Exception handling for invalid states appears to be a safeguard rather than malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Presence\n- The code snippets provided are consistent across reports.\n- All functions (`store_login_attempt` and `get_approx_account_lockouts_from_login_attempts`) are present and functionally similar.\n- No discrepancies or missing logic are observed.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes\n- The logic for filtering and counting login attempts appears correct.\n- The exception `raise Exception(\"Invalid state requested\")` triggers if none of the conditions for IP and username lockout configurations are met, which is a safeguard against invalid input or configuration states.\n- No evidence of logic errors or security flaws in how attempts are stored or retrieved.\n\n### Scores & Reasonableness\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: low (0.1 - 0.2)\n  - `confidence`: high (0.9 - 1)\n- These scores seem appropriate given the analysis: standard, secure, and non-malicious code.\n\n### Malware & Obfuscated Scores\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n- Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated are justified.\n\n### Security Risk & Justification\n- The overall security risk is low, as the code performs expected login attempt tracking.\n- The only minor concern could be the exception raising, but it's a safeguard, not malicious.\n- No data leaks, external network activity, or code injection observed.\n\n### Potential Assumptions & Claims\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is straightforward.\n- The use of configuration flags and database queries is standard.\n\n### Consistency & Final Estimation\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n- Based on the detailed review, I agree with the given scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (due to exception handling and configuration dependencies, but overall low risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code functions as a typical login attempt tracker.\n- No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The exception handling is a defensive measure, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is a standard, secure implementation for login attempt tracking with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.",
