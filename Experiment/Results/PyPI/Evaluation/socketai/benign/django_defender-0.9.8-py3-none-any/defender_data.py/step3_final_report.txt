{
  "purpose": "The code logs login attempts and retrieves counts for lockout enforcement based on IP and username, using Django ORM queries and configuration flags.",
  "sources": "Input data includes user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, login_valid; data is stored via AccessAttempt.objects.create().",
  "sinks": "Database queries filtering by attempt_time, ip_address, username; potential data leakage if misconfigured, but standard for logging.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into database storage; retrieval filters apply based on configuration flags, leading to count calculations for lockout logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies; exception for invalid state is a safeguard, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of login attempt tracking with conditional filtering based on configuration flags. It uses standard Django ORM queries, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The exception handling is a safeguard, not malicious. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure login attempt logging mechanism with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and align with the detailed analysis.",
