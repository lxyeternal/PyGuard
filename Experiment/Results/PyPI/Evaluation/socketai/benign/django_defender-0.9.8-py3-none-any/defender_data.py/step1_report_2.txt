{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to record login attempts and retrieve the number of lockouts based on failed login attempts within a specified timeframe.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, login_valid; and from the database via AccessAttempt.objects.filter(q).",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the database where login attempts are stored and retrieved. No other sinks like network or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in the database through AccessAttempt.objects.create().; Retrieval of login attempt counts occurs via filtered database queries based on IP address and username.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code properly uses configuration flags and limits.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a login attempt tracker, storing login attempts and calculating lockout counts based on recent failures. It uses configuration flags to control behavior, such as disabling lockouts or storing attempts. The code performs filtering via Django ORM with conditional logic based on parameters and configuration. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling is detected. The only notable point is the use of configuration flags, but these are standard for such systems and do not introduce malicious behavior. The exception raised on invalid state seems to be a safeguard rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of login attempt tracking with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It correctly manages failure counts for lockouts based on configuration flags, without exposing sensitive data or performing any suspicious actions.",
