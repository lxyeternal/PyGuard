{
  "purpose": "The code manages and tracks login attempts for user authentication, including storing attempts and retrieving approximate lockout counts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, login_valid. Reads configuration settings from 'config'. Reads data from database model 'AccessAttempt'.",
  "sinks": "Database operations (AccessAttempt.objects.create, filter, count).",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct database queries to count recent failed login attempts, which influence security policies like account lockouts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code structures. Use of exception for invalid state is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with a database to store and retrieve login attempt data, based on configurable thresholds. No data leakage, insecure handling, or malicious activities are evident. It performs straightforward CRUD operations with proper condition checks and configuration adherence.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, security-focused login attempt management module without malicious intent. It follows best practices for handling login attempt data and lockout logic, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
