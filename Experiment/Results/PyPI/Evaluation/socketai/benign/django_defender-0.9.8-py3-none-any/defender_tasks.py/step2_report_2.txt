  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward login attempt logger that calls `store_login_attempt` with various parameters.\n- They note the optional wrapping of the function as a Celery shared task based on configuration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The flow is standard: data collection and storage invocation, with optional asynchronous execution.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Validity:\n- The code itself is simple and appears correct.\n- The parameters are typical for login logging.\n- The conditional use of Celery is standard and correctly implemented.\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- The only potential concern is whether `store_login_attempt` might handle sensitive data improperly, but that is outside this snippet's scope.\n\n### Scores and Reasonableness:\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- Security risk scores are low, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Risk Score Justification:\n- The overall risk score is 0.1 or 0, which seems appropriate given the code's benign intent.\n- No evidence suggests any security threat or vulnerability.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The code relies on `store_login_attempt` to handle data securely. If that function mishandles data, security could be compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n- The use of `USE_CELERY` introduces asynchronous behavior, but no issues are apparent.\n\n### Consistency and Final Assessment:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' findings.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but given the minimal risk, 0.1 is acceptable)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign login logging utility with optional asynchronous processing. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are present. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and typical for login attempt logging.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- The overall risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is nonexistent.",
