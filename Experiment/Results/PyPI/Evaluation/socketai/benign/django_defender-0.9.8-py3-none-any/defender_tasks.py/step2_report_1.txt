  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines `add_login_attempt_task` which calls `store_login_attempt` with several parameters.\n- Conditionally decorates `add_login_attempt_task` with `@shared_task` if `config.USE_CELERY` is true.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code are present.\n- The data flow is straightforward: parameters to `store_login_attempt`.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes a straightforward logging function with optional Celery decoration.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious behavior, anomalies, or obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1; correct.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above; accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; straightforward, no malicious signs.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, fitting.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; standard logging pattern with optional async.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as no security concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- The risk scores are uniformly low (0.1 or 0), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, consistent with no malicious activity detected.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential Adjustments:** No adjustments needed; the code is clearly safe.\n- **Additional considerations:** Since the `store_login_attempt` function's implementation isn't shown, if it performs dangerous actions (e.g., exfiltration, code injection), that could change the assessment. However, based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given it's a logging function with no known vulnerabilities)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, benign login logging utility with optional asynchronous execution, and no security concerns are evident from the provided snippet.",
