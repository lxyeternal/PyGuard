{
  "purpose": "Define a function to record login attempts and optionally decorate it as a Celery task for asynchronous processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function: user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, login_valid.",
  "sinks": "The store_login_attempt function likely writes data to a database or log; no other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into store_login_attempt; if USE_CELERY is true, the function is wrapped as an asynchronous task, but data flow remains the same.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic present. No unusual code or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward logging function that records login attempt details. It conditionally registers this function as a Celery task based on configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The data flow is typical for a login logging system. The use of Celery for async task execution is standard, provided USE_CELERY is correctly configured. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard login attempt logger with optional asynchronous execution. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
