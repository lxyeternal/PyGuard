  "purpose": "Defines a login attempt logging function that optionally uses Celery for asynchronous execution.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, login_valid; config.USE_CELERY; import of store_login_attempt.",
  "sinks": "store_login_attempt function call (potential data storage point).",
  "flows": "Parameters passed into add_login_attempt_task → store_login_attempt.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data logging with conditional async decorator.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, clear login attempt logger that calls store_login_attempt with provided parameters. It conditionally applies a Celery shared_task decorator based on configuration. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The data flow is direct, and the code aligns with standard practices. The security implications depend on store_login_attempt's implementation, but within this snippet, no malicious or risky behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for login logging with optional asynchronous execution. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected based solely on this snippet. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the benign nature of the code.",
