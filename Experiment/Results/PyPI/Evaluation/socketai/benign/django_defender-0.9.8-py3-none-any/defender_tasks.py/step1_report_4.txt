{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to record login attempts by calling a storage function, potentially asynchronously with Celery.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function add_login_attempt_task: user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, login_valid.",
  "sinks": "The store_login_attempt function which likely writes data to a database or log.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the function parameters to the store_login_attempt call. If USE_CELERY is true, the function is wrapped as an asynchronous task via Celery, which may handle parameters in a queued task.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code constructs observed. Use of shared_task is conditional but typical for asynchronous task management. No external data fetching or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to log login attempts with provided parameters. It uses a local import for store_login_attempt and conditionally decorates the function with Celery's shared_task if configured to do so. The parameters appear to be standard for logging login data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code’s structure is straightforward and does not involve any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate component for logging login attempts, with optional asynchronous processing via Celery. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks in this snippet.",
