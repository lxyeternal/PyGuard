  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines `add_login_attempt_task` which calls `store_login_attempt` with several parameters.\n- Conditionally decorates `add_login_attempt_task` with `@shared_task` if `config.USE_CELERY` is true.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code present.\n- The flow is straightforward: parameters are passed into `store_login_attempt`.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Straightforward logging, optional async via Celery.\n- No anomalies, malicious behavior, or backdoors.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (low, perhaps due to potential misuse if `store_login_attempt` is insecure)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign. The low security risk score is reasonable, considering potential misconfigurations but no actual issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard pattern.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, confirming benign nature.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: legitimate logging, optional async.\n- No anomalies.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms benign intent.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\nAll reports agree that the code is a standard, benign login logging function with optional asynchronous execution via Celery. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors, and no suspicious data flow.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The `store_login_attempt` function is a sink; if it writes to a database, ensure it handles data securely. But based on the code, no issues are evident.\n- The configuration toggle for Celery is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n### Final Scoring Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to potential misconfiguration or insecure storage implementation outside this snippet)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard login attempt logger with optional asynchronous processing. The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
