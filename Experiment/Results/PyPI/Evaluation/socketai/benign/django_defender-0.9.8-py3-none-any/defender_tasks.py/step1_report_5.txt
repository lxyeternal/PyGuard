{
  "purpose": "To record login attempt data, potentially as part of an authentication logging system.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: user_agent, ip_address, username, http_accept, path_info, login_valid",
  "sinks": "store_login_attempt function call; if used with external storage or logging, it could be a sink depending on implementation",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters to the store_login_attempt function; no external or untrusted data flow outside these parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. Use of Celery is standard for task queuing. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to log login attempts by passing parameters to a storage function. It conditionally decorates the function with a Celery task decorator based on configuration. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code are present. The code structure is straightforward, with typical usage of task queuing for asynchronous execution. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign login attempt logging mechanism. It efficiently separates task execution from request handling and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
