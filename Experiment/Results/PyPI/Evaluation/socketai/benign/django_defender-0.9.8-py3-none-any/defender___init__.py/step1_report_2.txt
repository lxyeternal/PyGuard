  "purpose": "Define the version number of a software package",
  "sources": "Assignment to VERSION tuple and joining into __version__ string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; version string creation is benign",
  "flows": "Assign VERSION tuple -> convert to strings -> join into __version__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; straightforward version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version tuple, then constructs a version string by joining the tuple elements. There are no input sources, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be a standard version declaration typically found in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
