  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code verification**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward version declaration: defining a tuple and converting it into a string for `__version__`. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, standard, and does not interact with external inputs or outputs.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no data flows, sinks, or anomalies. No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue**:  \n- **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n- **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **SecurityRisk**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**:  \nSince the code is a standard version declaration with no suspicious activity, the risk score should remain at 0. Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:  \nNo malicious intent or behavior is present; the malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:  \nAll reports correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis, confirming benign behavior.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
