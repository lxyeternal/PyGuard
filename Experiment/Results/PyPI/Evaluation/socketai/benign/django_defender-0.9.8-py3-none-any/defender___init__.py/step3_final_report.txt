  "purpose": "Define a version tuple and create a version string for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of VERSION tuple; conversion of tuple elements to strings; joining with dots.",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static tuple to VERSION and creates a version string by joining its elements. It is a common pattern in Python packages for versioning. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior are present. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are appropriate given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
