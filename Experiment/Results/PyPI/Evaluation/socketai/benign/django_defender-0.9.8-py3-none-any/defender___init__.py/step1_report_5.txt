  "purpose": "Define the version number of the package or module",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only constructs a version string from a predefined tuple",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no external data output or manipulation",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment and string join",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string creation",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a version tuple and constructs a version string by joining its elements. There are no signs of malicious activity, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The code is standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
