  "purpose": "Manage and parse URI schemes for image storage locations in Glance, supporting various storage backends and scheme registration.",
  "sources": "URI input strings provided to get_location_from_uri and get_location_from_uri_and_backend functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only parses URIs and creates Location objects, without executing untrusted code or network operations.",
  "flows": "URI strings are parsed via urllib.parse.urlparse, scheme validation occurs, and Location objects are instantiated with scheme info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; parse_uri and get_uri are placeholders for subclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard URI handling framework with scheme registration, validation, and location object management. It uses urllib.parse for parsing, validates schemes, and allows flexible registration of schemes and backends. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The placeholder methods in StoreLocation subclasses could be misused if subclasses implement insecure logic, but this is outside the current code scope. Logging is used for debugging, not malicious purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and low inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, secure URI management module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified, and the malware score correctly remains at 0. The potential risk depends on subclass implementations, which are outside this code's scope.",
