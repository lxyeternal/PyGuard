  "purpose": "This code defines a framework for handling image storage locations in Glance, including URI parsing, scheme registration, and store location management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as 'uri', 'conf', 'scheme_map', and data within store_specs. It also processes URIs via urllib.parse.urlparse.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the parse_uri() method in store location subclasses where URIs are processed, and get_uri() methods that generate internal URIs. No direct output of untrusted data is observed.",
  "flows": "URIs provided to get_location_from_uri() or get_location_from_uri_and_backend() flow into parse_uri() methods of store location classes, which may interpret credentials or other sensitive info. The register_scheme_backend_map() and register_scheme_map() functions update internal mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code properly separates public URIs from internal URIs. No unsafe or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a scheme-to-class mapping and processes URIs through standard parsing functions. It includes error handling for unknown schemes. The parse_uri() and get_uri() methods are meant to be implemented by subclasses, potentially handling sensitive information internally. No evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or unauthorized actions. The use of internal URIs to encode credentials is standard within a controlled environment, not inherently malicious. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured URI handling module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for managing storage location URIs in Glance. No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It primarily handles URI parsing, scheme registration, and internal data management securely within expected parameters.",
