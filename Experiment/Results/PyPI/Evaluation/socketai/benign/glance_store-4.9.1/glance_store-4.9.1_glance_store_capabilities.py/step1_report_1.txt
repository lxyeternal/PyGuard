{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for managing storage capabilities and permissions in a storage driver context, including capability checks and dynamic capability updates.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are explicitly read in this code. It references store operations via decorators, and logging is used for internal status messages.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include raising exceptions for unsupported operations, but no direct data leaks, external data transmission, or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves capability checks before executing storage operations (get, add, delete). The decorator ensures capability validation occurs prior to the actual operation, but no untrusted data flows into external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses standard enum and class patterns, with straightforward capability management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines capability bit masks, a capability management class, and a decorator for pre-operation checks. It does not process user input, read from external data sources, or write data to external systems. Its purpose is to enforce capabilities at runtime, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The dynamic capability methods and logging are standard, and the code does not perform any unsafe operations or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate capability management module for storage drivers with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It uses standard programming constructs and patterns for capability enforcement and logging.",
