  "purpose": "Configuration for generating documentation using Sphinx for the Glance_store project.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, extension list, and project metadata within the script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output beyond configuration variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections. The script contains only standard configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with metadata, extension list, and HTML/LaTeX/Man/Texinfo output options. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, network operations, or external data processing. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. All parameters are static and related solely to documentation build processes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical documentation configuration file with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
