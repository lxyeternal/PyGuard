  "purpose": "Static configuration file for Sphinx documentation build setup.",
  "sources": "Predefined variables, comments, static lists, and path assignments within the configuration script.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform runtime operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, declarative configuration for documentation generation using Sphinx. It contains only variable assignments, comments, and paths, with no dynamic execution, input handling, network activity, or external data processing. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature. Therefore, the final assessment confirms a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
