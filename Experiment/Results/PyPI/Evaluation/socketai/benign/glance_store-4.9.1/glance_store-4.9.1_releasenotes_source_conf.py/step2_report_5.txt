  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The code contains only variable assignments, comments, and static lists.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- All reports agree on benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any code that could be malicious or vulnerable.\n- No input handling, no external calls, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The configuration is standard for documentation build setup.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No flaws are evident; the reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0) are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Score suggestions:\n- The current scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n- Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk scores are 0.0, which is justified because:\n  - No malicious code or behavior is present.\n  - No potential vulnerabilities are introduced by static configuration.\n  - No external or untrusted data is processed.\n\n### Malware score:\n- The malware score is 0, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious activity.\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all reports and the code content, my estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no security concerns. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
