  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup for the glance_store project.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules, modifies sys.path, and mocks certain modules to prevent import errors during documentation build.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network communication, or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Initialization and configuration data flow; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path modification and mocking modules is standard in documentation scripts; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration file with standard practices such as path modification and module mocking. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The mocking of modules is typical for documentation generation and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration script used for documentation purposes. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are present. The scores should reflect a safe, non-malicious codebase.",
