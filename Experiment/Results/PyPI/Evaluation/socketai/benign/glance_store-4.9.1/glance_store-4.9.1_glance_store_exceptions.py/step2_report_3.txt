  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard set of exception classes with message templates. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.\n- **Assessment:** The code only defines exception classes, uses standard libraries, and does not process untrusted input in a dangerous way. URL parsing in RedirectException is straightforward and does not involve executing code or network activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected. Security risk is negligible.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe use of URL parsing and message templates.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The URL parsing is simple and does not involve network calls or code execution.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with message templates; potential concern about untrusted data in messages.\n- **Assessment:** The only potential risk is the use of external data in message formatting and URL parsing in RedirectException. However, URL parsing is safe, and message formatting is standard. No code injection or malicious payloads are present.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 remains appropriate. Security risk is minimal.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with slight concern about message formatting with untrusted data.\n- **Assessment:** The message formatting could pose a risk if untrusted data is used maliciously, but in the context of exception handling, this is a common pattern and not inherently dangerous. URL parsing is benign.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar observations, with mention of potential issues with message formatting and URL parsing.\n- **Assessment:** The URL parsing in RedirectException is safe; message formatting with kwargs is standard and not dangerous unless used improperly elsewhere. No code injection or malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0; no malware detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 at most, primarily due to potential message formatting issues if external data is malicious, but this is a common pattern in exception handling and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for the Glance storage component. It uses standard libraries, does not execute untrusted code, and lacks any suspicious patterns. The URL parsing is safe and only used for storing parsed URLs, not for executing or redirecting. The message templates are typical for exception handling and do not pose security threats.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to message formatting considerations, but overall benign)\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation of exception classes with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
