{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the Glance Store component, including messages and handling for various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly 'urllib.parse.urlparse' used in RedirectException; exception initializers accepting input parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the exception classes or methods directly process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input data (such as URLs or error details) flows into exception initializers but is only used for setting message attributes; no untrusted data reaches critical system functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Exception messages use string formatting but no evidence of malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with associated message templates. It imports 'urllib.parse' for URL parsing in 'RedirectException' but does not perform any network operations or dynamic code execution. All message handling appears safe, with no handling of untrusted data that could lead to injection or data leaks. The structure and content suggest a straightforward implementation for error handling without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes for error handling in the Glance Store component. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It safely defines error messages and minimal URL parsing for redirection purposes. Overall, it appears benign and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
