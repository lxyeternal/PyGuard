  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign set of exception classes with no malicious or security issues.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no untrusted data processing beyond message formatting and URL parsing.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. The code is standard, safe, and contains no malware.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95 (high confidence in benign nature).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the safe use of 'urllib.parse' and straightforward exception class definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation. URL parsing is safe, and message templates are static or controlled.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No security risks or malware indications.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes potential concern around message formatting with untrusted data but concludes it's safe.\n- **Analysis:** The only noteworthy point is the URL parsing in 'RedirectException,' which is safe if input is controlled. No code execution or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, notes potential risk in message formatting but finds it benign.\n- **Analysis:** The only slight concern is message formatting with kwargs, which could be problematic if untrusted data is used maliciously, but it doesn't lead to code execution.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Points out potential issues with message formatting and URL parsing but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** The URL parsing in 'RedirectException' is safe; message formatting with kwargs is standard practice, assuming proper usage.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on zero; the code shows no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but all are below 0.5, indicating minimal to no security risk.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — negligible, primarily due to potential message formatting issues if misused, but not a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for the Glance storage system. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or exploitable vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the handling of message formatting with external data, which is common and not inherently dangerous here.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The supply chain risk for this package is very low; no further action needed.",
