{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of exception classes for the Glance store component, primarily used for error handling and messaging within the system.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from external modules (urllib.parse in RedirectException) and from message templates used in exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages formatted with kwargs, URL parsing in RedirectException, but no data flows leading to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URLs, message parameters) are used in exception instantiation; URL is parsed and stored, message templates are formatted with provided kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "Potential for message formatting with untrusted data, but no actual malicious code or obfuscation present. URL parsing is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of exception classes with message templates and minimal URL parsing. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data that could lead to security issues. The message formatting could be risky if external data is malicious, but this is typical for exception messages and does not constitute malicious behavior. URL parsing is safe and only stores parsed URLs without network operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The potential risks associated with message formatting are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible.",
