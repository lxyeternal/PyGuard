{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Glance Store components, including error messages and handling for various failure scenarios.",
  "sources": "Input is primarily from constructor parameters and the 'url' argument in RedirectException; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Formatted exception messages with potential use of untrusted data, especially in messages involving user input or external URLs (e.g., in RedirectException).",
  "flows": "Input data such as URLs and message arguments flow into exception constructors, which generate messages and store data within exception objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of standard exception handling and URL parsing is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with message templates, some utilizing dynamic data insertion. The only potentially risky part is the RedirectException, which parses URLs from input; however, it simply stores the parsed URL object without executing or redirecting. All exception messages are standard and do not contain code execution or malicious payloads. The rest of the code adheres to typical pattern for custom exceptions. No signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Overall, this is standard, safe exception handling code.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of standard exception class definitions for a storage system, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The use of URL parsing in RedirectException is benign. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
