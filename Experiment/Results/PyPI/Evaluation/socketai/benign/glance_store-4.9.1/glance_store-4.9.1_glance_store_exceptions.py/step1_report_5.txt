{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Glance Store component, providing standardized error messages and handling for various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'url' parameter in RedirectException, and message templates with kwargs in the exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'message' strings formatted with untrusted kwargs, and the 'url' in RedirectException which may be used for redirects.",
  "flows": "Input from 'url' in RedirectException flows into URL parsing; message formatting with kwargs occurs in exception constructors, which could lead to format string issues if untrusted data is used.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of standard libraries and typical exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes for error handling with customizable messages and URL parsing. The only potentially sensitive operation is the parsing of a URL in RedirectException, which itself does not perform network operations. Message formatting occurs with provided kwargs, which could cause formatting issues if untrusted data is malicious, but no code injection or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It handles error messages and URL parsing safely, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
