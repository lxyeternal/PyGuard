  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a base class for storage backends with configuration registration, dynamic class import, and a backward compatibility decorator. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The dynamic import is standard in plugin systems, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns, configuration, dynamic import, and backward compatibility. No malicious intent or backdoors identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Focuses on dynamic class import via `importutils.import_class`, which could be a potential attack vector if the module path is maliciously manipulated. However, in typical plugin systems, this is standard practice, and no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3 — slightly higher risk due to dynamic import but still low.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic import is a potential concern if external inputs influence the module name, but there's no evidence of malicious intent here.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the code is a standard abstract class with configuration, capability checks, and a backward compatibility wrapper. No malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, with standard patterns, dynamic class import, and method wrappers. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher in some reports (up to 0.3) due to dynamic import, but this is a known pattern in plugin architectures and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minor risk due to dynamic import, but acceptable in plugin systems with proper controls.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured abstract base class for storage backends, employing common patterns such as configuration registration, dynamic class loading, and backward compatibility wrappers. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The slight concern about dynamic import is typical in plugin systems and does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain standard security practices, such as validating module paths before dynamic import if user input influences them, but overall, the code appears safe.",
