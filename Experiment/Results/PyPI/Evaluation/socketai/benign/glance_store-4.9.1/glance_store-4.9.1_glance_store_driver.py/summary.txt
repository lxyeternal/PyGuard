  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured plugin base class for storage backends, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The use of dynamic import and argument wrapping are standard patterns in extensible systems. The low security risk score is justified, with a slight increase to account for potential misuse if external inputs influence module names. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose."
