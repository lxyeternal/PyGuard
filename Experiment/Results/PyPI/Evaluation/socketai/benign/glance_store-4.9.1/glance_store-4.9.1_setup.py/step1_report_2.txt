  "flows": "N/A, straightforward setup invocation without external data sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that uses setuptools and pbr to configure package installation. It specifies a dependency on pbr version 2.0.0 or higher and enables pbr. The script contains licensing comments but no executable logic beyond setup invocation. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code performs a typical package setup task without any indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats.",
