  "purpose": "Manages storage backends, configuration options, driver loading, and validation for a plugin-based storage system.",
  "sources": "Configuration options, external driver plugins loaded via stevedore, URI parsing, metadata validation.",
  "sinks": "Store methods invoked with URIs, metadata, and data streams; potential untrusted input from external plugins.",
  "flows": "Configuration and URI inputs lead to driver loading, which then handle data transfer, storage, and metadata operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; reliance on external plugins is standard but could be a supply chain vector.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured plugin-based storage management system, utilizing standard libraries and practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The dynamic plugin loading via stevedore introduces a typical supply chain consideration but does not indicate malicious intent. Metadata validation and error handling are standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential external plugin risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity. The low risk score reflects typical supply chain considerations inherent in plugin architectures. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
