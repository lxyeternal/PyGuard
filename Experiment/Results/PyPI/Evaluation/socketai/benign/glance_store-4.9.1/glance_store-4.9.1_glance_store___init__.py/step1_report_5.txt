{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various components from local package files for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .multi_backend, .backend, .driver, .exceptions",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data flows; no network, file, or environment variable access observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Use of star imports (from module import *) can mask the actual imported symbols and may hinder code clarity, but does not constitute malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code contains license and copyright comments followed by four import statements using star syntax. These imports bring in all symbols from the specified local modules. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious logic are present. The star imports could be a concern for maintainability but are not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import pattern in a Python package, primarily for modularization and code organization. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
