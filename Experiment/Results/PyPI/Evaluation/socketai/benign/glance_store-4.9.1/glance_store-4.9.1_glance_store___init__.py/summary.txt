  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of license headers and import statements. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but does not indicate malicious activity. Scores are appropriate; no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal. Further review of imported modules could be considered, but this fragment appears safe."
