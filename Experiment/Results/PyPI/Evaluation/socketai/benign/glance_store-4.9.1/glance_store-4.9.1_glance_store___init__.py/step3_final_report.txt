  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports, which can obscure dependencies",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license headers and four import statements using wildcard syntax. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. Wildcard imports are discouraged for clarity and maintainability but are common in package __init__.py files. No signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks are visible. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, reflecting no malicious activity. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to the style concern of wildcard imports. Confidence is high (0.8-0.9) given the simplicity of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of license headers and import statements. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but does not indicate malicious activity. Scores are appropriate; no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal. Further review of imported modules could be considered, but this fragment appears safe.",
