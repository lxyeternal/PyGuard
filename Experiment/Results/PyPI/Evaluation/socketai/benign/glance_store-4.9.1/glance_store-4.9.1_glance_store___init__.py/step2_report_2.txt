  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports focus on the same code snippet: license headers and four import statements with wildcard imports.\n- No actual logic, data processing, or external data sources are present.\n- The main concern raised is the use of `from ... import *`, which can obscure symbol origins and potentially hide malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The core concern is the use of wildcard imports, which is valid across all reports. No other issues like hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that wildcard imports can obscure dependencies and potentially hide malicious code.  \n- They also correctly note that the code itself is benign in this fragment, with no direct malicious activity.\n\n- **However**, the emphasis on wildcard imports as a security concern is somewhat overstated in isolation, especially in a standard package `__init__.py` or module aggregation context, where such imports are common.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or payloads. This is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2. Given the code is just import statements with no runtime logic, these are reasonable. The slight concern stems from wildcard imports, but the overall risk remains low.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  Mostly high (0.8 to 0.9), justified by the clarity of the code fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations and justifications:\n\n- The reports correctly avoid overestimating the risk, given the limited code scope.\n- The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but not inherently malicious. It warrants further review of the imported modules but doesn't justify a high security risk score.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (consistent with the reports)  \n\nGiven the evidence, I would set:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since wildcard imports can be a maintainability and security concern if modules are malicious, but no evidence here)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The main concern—the use of wildcard imports—is a style and maintainability issue rather than a direct security threat in this context. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign but could benefit from avoiding wildcard imports for clarity and security hygiene.",
