{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import statement block, likely for a larger Python package, with no specific operational logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: multi_backend, backend, driver, exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths or source-to-sink transfers present in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (from ... import *) which can obscure actual dependencies and make analysis harder; no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of license comments and four import statements with wildcards. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged as they can hide dependencies and make security analysis more difficult. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are observable, and no data input or output handling exists in this fragment. The license header is standard and unrelated to malicious activity. Since no logic or runtime behavior is defined, the code itself does not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of import statements in a Python package module, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but not inherently dangerous.",
