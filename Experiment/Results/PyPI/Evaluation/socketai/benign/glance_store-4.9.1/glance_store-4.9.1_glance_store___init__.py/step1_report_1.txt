{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple modules related to backend, driver, exceptions, and multi-backend functionalities, likely as part of a larger software package or framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements (from .module import *) which load internal modules; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and does not process data or execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) which can obscure the origin and contents of imported symbols, potentially hiding malicious code or unintended behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license headers and import statements with wildcard imports. These wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution and may hide malicious or unwanted code if the imported modules contain such content. No data sources, sinks, or data flow logic are present in this fragment. The lack of explicit logic makes it difficult to identify malicious intent directly from this snippet, but the wildcard imports warrant scrutiny of the imported modules for malicious code or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily import boilerplate with license headers and does not exhibit direct malicious behavior. However, the use of wildcard imports could potentially hide malicious code within the imported modules. Further review of those modules is recommended to confirm their safety.",
