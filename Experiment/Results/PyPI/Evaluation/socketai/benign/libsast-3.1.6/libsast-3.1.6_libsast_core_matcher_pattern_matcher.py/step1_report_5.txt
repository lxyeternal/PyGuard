{
  "purpose": "Pattern matching and scanning files or directories for specific rules, primarily for security or code analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "File paths provided in 'paths' argument, file contents read in 'read_file_contents' and '_read_file_content' methods, rule definitions in 'scan_rules'.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by 'read_text' in '_read_file_content', data processed in 'pattern_matcher', and results accumulated in 'add_finding'.",
  "flows": "Paths input -> 'read_file_contents' filters and reads files -> 'regex_scan' dispatches to parallel processing pools -> 'pattern_matcher' applies rules -> 'add_finding' stores results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden network activities. Uses standard file handling and parallel processing techniques. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured pattern matcher designed for static analysis of files. It filters files by extension and size, reads content asynchronously, and applies rules using various parallel processing methods (threading, billiard, or multiprocessing). Validation of rules ensures proper format and supported matchers. The pattern matching is done via predefined matchers and includes caching for content formatting. Results are stored in a structured manner. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are evident. The code relies on external libraries for matchers and common utilities but does not invoke unsafe or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate pattern matching utility intended for static code or text analysis. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or malware indicators based on the provided implementation. It handles files securely and processes rules appropriately. No evidence of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious intent is found.",
