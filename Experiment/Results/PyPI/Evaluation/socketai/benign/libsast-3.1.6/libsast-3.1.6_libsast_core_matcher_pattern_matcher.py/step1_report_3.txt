{
  "purpose": "Pattern matching in files based on rules for static analysis or code scanning.",
  "sources": "File paths provided to read_file_contents; file objects in _read_file_content; rules loaded from options and validated; data read from files in read_file_contents.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from file.read_text() used for pattern matching; exceptions raised during file reading and rule validation; results generated in pattern_matcher stored in findings.",
  "flows": "Paths from file paths to _read_file_content, then to pattern_matcher for matching; rule validation checks input rules; results flow from pattern_matcher back to add_finding which aggregates findings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. Use of thread pools and process pools is standard for concurrency. No unusual or obfuscated code patterns. Exception handling around file reading is normal. No code injecting untrusted code or network activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis pattern matching tool that loads files, applies regex rules, and records matches. It uses concurrency for efficiency and includes validation of rules and error handling. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is that it processes files and rules but does not perform any network or system modifications. No suspicious code segments, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The flow strictly pertains to pattern matching and data collection. The use of multiprocessing and threading is standard for performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate pattern matching utility for static code analysis. No malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malware indications are present. It appears to be a benign tool designed for security or code auditing purposes.",
