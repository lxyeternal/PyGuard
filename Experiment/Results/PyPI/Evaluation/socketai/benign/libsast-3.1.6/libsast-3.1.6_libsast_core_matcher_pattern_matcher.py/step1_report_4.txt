{
  "purpose": "Pattern matching in files to detect security rules or code patterns based on user-defined rules.",
  "sources": "File paths and contents read from the filesystem using 'read_text' method; input file paths provided to 'scan' and 'read_file_contents' functions.",
  "sinks": "Data processed in '_read_file_content' (reading file contents), 'pattern_matcher' (pattern matching execution), and 'add_finding' (storing results). No direct data leakage or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "File paths are read and contents loaded; data is formatted and pattern-matched; matches are stored in 'findings'. No untrusted data flows outside controlled read and processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and clear structure. Exception handling is minimal but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file validation, reading, pattern matching, and results aggregation in a structured way. It uses thread or process pools for concurrency, which is standard. No external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The only potential concern is the exception handling printing errors to stdout, but that is typical for debugging, not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a file pattern matcher for security rules, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or supply chain attacks. It is a benign utility designed for static analysis of files based on rules provided by the user.",
