{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to load YAML-based standards/mappings from files and apply them to a set of rules by expanding metadata values based on these standards.",
  "sources": "The code reads YAML files from a directory structure using Path.glob() and read_yaml() function, which presumably reads YAML content from files.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'metadata' field of rules, but does not process untrusted input directly in a way that leads to code execution or data leaks within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source data (YAML files) flow through read_yaml() into dictionaries, which are then used to update rule dictionaries by matching and expanding metadata keys.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code performs standard file reading, dictionary updating, and string handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads YAML files from a 'standards' directory, processes a list of rules by expanding their metadata according to the standards mappings, and returns the updated rules. The use of Path and YAML reading functions is standard. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a utility for managing configuration mappings, with safe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for reading standard mappings from YAML files and applying these mappings to a list of rules. There are no signs of malicious activity, malicious code injection, or security risks within this fragment.",
