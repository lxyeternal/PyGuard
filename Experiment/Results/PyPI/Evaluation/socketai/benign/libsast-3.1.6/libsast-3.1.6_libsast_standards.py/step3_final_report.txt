  "purpose": "Utility for loading YAML standards files and applying mappings to rules based on metadata keys.",
  "sources": "Reads YAML files from the 'standards' directory within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; operates in-memory, updating rule dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Loads YAML files -> updates rule metadata based on standards mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file reading and dictionary updates.",
  "analysis": "The code loads YAML files from a directory, parses them with 'read_yaml', and updates rules' metadata fields based on mappings defined in the standards files. It performs safe file I/O, uses standard libraries, and does not execute code or perform network operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The 'read_yaml' function is assumed safe; risks are limited to external YAML content potentially being malicious if crafted maliciously, but this is a standard configuration risk. Overall, the code is a benign utility for standards management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility for loading and applying standards mappings with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score of approximately 0.1 is justified, primarily considering potential risks from external YAML files, not from the code itself.",
