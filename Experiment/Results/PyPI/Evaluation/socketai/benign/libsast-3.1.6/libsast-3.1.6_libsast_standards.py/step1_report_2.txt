{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read YAML-based standards or rules from a directory and apply mappings to rule metadata for normalization or expansion.",
  "sources": "Reads YAML files from the 'standards' directory and the input 'rules' data structure.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the 'rules' data structure in memory; no direct output or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads YAML files into dictionaries; applies mappings to rule metadata keys; updates rules accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns identified. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles file I/O to load YAML files and updates in-memory rule data structures based on standards mappings. It uses standard libraries ('pathlib') and a custom 'read_yaml' function, presumably for parsing YAML. The code performs directory traversal, file reading, and dictionary updates without any suspicious or malicious operations. No network activity, credential handling, or system manipulation code is present. It appears to be a straightforward data normalization utility for rules and standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for loading and applying standards mappings to rules. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It does not contain obfuscated code or malware behavior. It is safe and performs typical file processing and dictionary updates.",
