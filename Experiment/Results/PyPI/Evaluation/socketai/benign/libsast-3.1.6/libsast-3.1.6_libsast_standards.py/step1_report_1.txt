{
  "purpose": "The code reads YAML files containing standards and applies mappings to rules based on metadata keys.",
  "sources": "Reads YAML files from the 'standards' directory and the rules parameter passed to get_mapping.",
  "sinks": "Updates rule dictionaries in memory; no direct data leakage or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads YAML files -> Loads rules -> Updates rule metadata based on standards -> Returns modified rules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code loads YAML files from a specified directory, processes rules by expanding certain metadata fields based on standards mappings, and returns the updated rules. It relies on external 'read_yaml' to parse YAML files, but this function is assumed to be a benign, standard YAML parser. No network activity, no credential handling, and no malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to perform standard configuration or rule processing with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward standards mapping utility with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It operates on local files and in-memory data without external communication or suspicious activities.",
