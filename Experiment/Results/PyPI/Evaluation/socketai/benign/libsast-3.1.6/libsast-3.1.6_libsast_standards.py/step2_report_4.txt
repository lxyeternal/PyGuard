  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, the report's claims, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a simple utility for loading YAML standards and applying mappings to rules.\n- It uses standard libraries and a presumed benign 'read_yaml' function.\n- No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code are present.\n- The logic is straightforward: read YAML files, build a mapping, and update rules accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Claims:** No malicious behavior, operates on local files, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature, but perhaps reflects the potential risk if external YAML files are maliciously crafted. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Claims:** No suspicious code, no malicious activity, standard file I/O.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report is thorough. The security risk is minimal, and malware score is appropriately zero. The confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Claims:** No suspicious behavior, standard YAML reading, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the code. The security risk is low, given no external communication or code injection.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Claims:** Standard configuration utility, no malicious intent, relies on external YAML files.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe minor security risk score accounts for potential malicious YAML content, which is a common concern but not specific to malicious code in this snippet.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Claims:** Similar to others, safe, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code and other reports.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Cross-Check:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1-0.2) reflect cautious acknowledgment of external YAML files' potential risk, which is reasonable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard configuration risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign utility for loading and applying standards mappings, with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
