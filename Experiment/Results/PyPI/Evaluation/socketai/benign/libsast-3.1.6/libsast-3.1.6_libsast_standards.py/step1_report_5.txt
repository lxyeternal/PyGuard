{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to load and process standard mappings from YAML files, and then expand rules based on these standards.",
  "sources": "The code reads YAML files from a directory ('standards') relative to the script's location, using the read_yaml function from an external library.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any actions that send data externally, write to files, or execute commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "YAML files are read into memory and their contents are used to expand rule metadata; there are no direct flows of untrusted data to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets, are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code loads YAML files from a specified directory, merging their contents into a dictionary. It then processes a list of rules, expanding metadata values based on the loaded standards. The functions rely on standard Python library functions and an external 'read_yaml' function. No network activity, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are present. The logic is simple and does not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign configuration and rule processing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely reads configuration data and performs straightforward data transformation.",
