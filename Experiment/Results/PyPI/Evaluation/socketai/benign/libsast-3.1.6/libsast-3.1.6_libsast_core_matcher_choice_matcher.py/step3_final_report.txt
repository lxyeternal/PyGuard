  "purpose": "A static pattern matching utility that scans files or directories for regex-based rules, primarily for security analysis or code review.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (`read_text`), rule validation, and regex pattern matching on file contents.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data externally or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Source: File contents loaded via `read_text`; processed through regex matching functions; results stored in internal findings dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of multiple concurrency models (threading, billiard, process pools) is standard for performance, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files with error handling, strips comments, validates rules, and applies regex patterns to identify matches. It employs concurrency for efficiency but does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All signals indicate a benign static analysis utility. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward pattern matching tool with no malicious or obfuscated features. The security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
