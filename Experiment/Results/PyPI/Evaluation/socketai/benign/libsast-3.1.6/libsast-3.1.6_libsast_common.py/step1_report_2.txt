{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for progress display, YAML file reading, and worker thread management in a security scanning tool.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LIBSAST_WORKERS' and input file objects for YAML parsing.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable reading (potential for misconfiguration), file reading (no direct sink for untrusted data), threading (no sensitive data handling here).",
  "flows": "Reading environment variable -> determining worker count; Reading file object -> parsing YAML; Progress bar updates during function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data, or unusual code behaviors. The code primarily consists of standard utility functions and threading logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper classes and functions for progress visualization, YAML parsing, and obtaining thread worker counts. It reads environment variables for configuration and handles file input for YAML parsing with exception handling. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are evident. Threading is used safely for progress updates without executing untrusted code. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code for a security tool with no malicious intent or behavior. It handles configuration and progress reporting securely. No malware or malicious activity detected.",
