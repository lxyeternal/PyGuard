{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for progress display, YAML loading, and environment-based worker count configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'LIBSAST_WORKERS', reads YAML files (via file object), reads from system modules (os, sys), and input/output streams.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables and system info could influence behavior but are generally safe; no data leaks or insecure operations identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LIBSAST_WORKERS' influences get_worker_count() output; YAML data is loaded from file objects; progress functions run arbitrary functions in threads but with no malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Progress bar implementation and environment checks are typical utility code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility classes and functions: ProgressBar manages progress display with threading; read_yaml safely loads YAML data with exception handling; get_worker_count uses environment variables and system info for concurrency settings. No suspicious code, no external network activity, no data exfiltration or malicious behavior detected. The code is standard for utility purposes, with proper exception handling and safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, focusing on progress display, YAML parsing, and environment-based configuration. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
