{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions and classes for progress display, YAML file reading, and determining worker thread count, intended to support a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input sources include: environment variables (os.getenv), file-like objects (file_obj), and external functions or iterators (iterator, function).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include: environment variable values, file content read via read_text, and data printed to sys.stderr or output streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or file inputs to functions (e.g., get_worker_count, read_yaml), with progress updates displayed via print statements. No untrusted data flows directly into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or unusual code constructs. Progress bar and YAML reading are standard utilities. Worker count adjustment based on environment appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and classes that facilitate progress display, YAML parsing, and thread-based function execution. The environment variable 'LIBSAST_WORKERS' influences thread pool size, with validation to prevent misuse. No data is transmitted externally or stored maliciously. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present. The code handles errors gracefully, raising custom exceptions for YAML issues. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for benign purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for progress indication, YAML loading, and worker thread count determination. No malicious intent or security risks are evident; the code is well-structured and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
