{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for progress display, YAML file reading, and worker thread management in a security scanning tool.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('LIBSAST_WORKERS'), reads YAML files, and processes data from input streams.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables and file input, but does not directly write to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables to determine worker count; loads YAML content; displays progress during processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors observed; standard use of threading and environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions and classes for progress display and configuration loading. It reads environment variables safely, with fallback defaults, and processes YAML files with exception handling. The threading for progress display is used appropriately without dangerous behavior. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. No suspicious behaviors or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for progress display and configuration handling within a larger application. No malicious activity or security risks are evident based on this code segment.",
