  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for progress display, YAML parsing, and system worker count determination.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LIBSAST_WORKERS', file objects for YAML, input parameters for progress functions.",
  "sinks": "Standard output/error streams, exception raising, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences worker count; YAML data read from file objects; progress display updates during function execution.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides benign utility functions with safe exception handling, standard threading for progress updates, and environment variable usage for configuration. No network activity, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The threading is used solely for progress indication, not executing untrusted code. YAML parsing is handled securely with exception management. The environment variable 'LIBSAST_WORKERS' is validated and defaults sensibly. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified. The reports correctly assess the benign nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
