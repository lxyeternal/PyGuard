  "purpose": "Helper functions for progress display, YAML reading, and worker count retrieval in a security analysis tool.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (get_worker_count), reading from file objects (read_yaml), user input or external data via file_obj.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks directly executing code or sending data over network.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or file object input influences worker count and YAML parsing, respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Progress bar and threading are standard, not malicious. YAML exception handling is normal. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'read_yaml' for parsing YAML files with error handling, 'get_worker_count' for determining concurrency based on environment variables and system info, and 'ProgressBar' for displaying progress. The environment variable 'LIBSAST_WORKERS' is used to set worker count, with safe fallback defaults. Threading in 'progress_function' is used for progress indication. No malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be standard helper functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malware, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It handles YAML parsing, progress display, and system resource detection securely and transparently.",
