{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Scanner class that performs security scans on files within specified paths, using pattern matching and semantic grep techniques.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'options' dictionary (for configuration) and 'paths' list (file/directory paths to scan).",
  "sinks": "The code processes file paths and directories, but does not include network, system modification, or external data transmission operations. No data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Paths are validated and collected through get_scan_files, then passed to pattern matching modules. There is no flow of untrusted data into system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard file validation and filtering for a scanning utility.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes scan options with defaults, validates input paths, collects valid files avoiding ignored paths/extensions/filenames, and performs pattern matching scans. It uses external modules for pattern matching but does not execute or evaluate untrusted input in a way that leads to system impact. No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured scanner utility designed for static code or file pattern analysis. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
