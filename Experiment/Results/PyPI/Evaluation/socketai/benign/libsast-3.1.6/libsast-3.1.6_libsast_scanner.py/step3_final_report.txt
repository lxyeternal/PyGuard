  "purpose": "A static analysis scanner module designed to scan files in specified paths using pattern matchers for security-related pattern detection.",
  "sources": "Path inputs for directory traversal, file names, and extensions used for filtering files to scan.",
  "sinks": "External pattern matcher modules (PatternMatcher, ChoiceMatcher, SemanticGrep) invoked for scanning; no direct sinks like network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Paths are traversed to gather files; filtered files are passed to matchers for pattern detection.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes configuration options, filters files based on ignore lists and path validation, and applies external pattern matchers to detect security patterns. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is standard for a static analysis utility, with no network activity or system modifications. External modules are assumed safe; no suspicious flows or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard static analysis utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risk. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
