{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and imports core components for a security analysis toolkit.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.core_matcher.pattern_matcher, .core_matcher.choice_matcher, .core_sgrep.semantic_sgrep, .scanner) and datetime for current year.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, network operations, or data handling with untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; module metadata assignment does not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard package setup with versioning and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata variables, imports internal modules, and defines the module's export list. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, and no suspicious operations. The use of current year and string formatting for copyright is benign. All imports are from internal modules, suggesting this is part of a larger package without embedded malicious behavior in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup/configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely manages module metadata and imports necessary components for the package.",
