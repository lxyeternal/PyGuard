  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import core components for a security analysis tool.",
  "sources": "Import statements from core_matcher, core_sgrep, and scanner modules; dynamic retrieval of current year using datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform risky operations are present",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted input; only static imports and metadata assignment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious dynamic behavior detected. The use of current year is standard. No obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module metadata such as title, authorship, copyright, version, and imports several components from local modules. The dynamic fetching of the current year is a benign operation. All imported modules appear to be part of a larger security or pattern matching framework. No input/output handling, external data processing, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and consistent with standard module initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign module setup with no malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities. It primarily manages metadata and imports core components for a security-related project.",
