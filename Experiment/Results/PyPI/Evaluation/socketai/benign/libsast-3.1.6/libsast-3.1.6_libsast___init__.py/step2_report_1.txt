  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily setting package metadata and importing internal modules.\n- The only dynamic operation is fetching the current year via `datetime.now().year`.\n- No user input, network activity, file I/O, or data sinks are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward module setup script, likely part of a larger package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None identified.\n- **Security flaws:** None. The code is simple, with no external data handling or risky operations.\n- **Other mistakes:** No mistakes apparent.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Note:** Since the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly assume the code is purely for metadata and module imports.\n- No assumptions about hidden behavior or malicious intent are warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard module initialization script that defines metadata and imports internal components. It involves no external data, no network or file operations, no user input, and no suspicious patterns. The use of `datetime.now().year` is common for dynamic copyright years.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation present in this code. It is a benign setup script with no supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.  \n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
