{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata and import core modules for a static analysis or security tool named 'libsast'.",
  "sources": "The only data input is the current year from datetime.now().year.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions such as network communication, file writing, or execution.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: current year data is used in metadata; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns are present. The imports are from local modules; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various modules, sets metadata variables, and defines an __all__ list for exports. It uses datetime to generate the current year for copyright info, which is standard practice. No untrusted data sources, no sinks, and no complex data flows are present. The code is clean, well-structured, and does not contain any signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a static analysis tool's initialization or configuration. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
