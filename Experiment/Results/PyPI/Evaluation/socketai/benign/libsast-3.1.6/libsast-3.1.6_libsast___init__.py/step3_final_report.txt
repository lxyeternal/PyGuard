  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and imports internal modules for the 'libsast' library.",
  "sources": "Fetching current year via datetime.now().year; importing internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static import and variable assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata setup with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initialization script setting metadata variables and importing internal components. It uses datetime to dynamically set the copyright year, which is standard. There are no user inputs, network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All imports are from local modules, indicating this is part of a larger, benign package. No data flows from untrusted sources, and no security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, standard package initialization.",
