{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be the initialization or setup script for a larger package related to security or pattern matching tools, defining metadata and importing necessary modules.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; only importing modules and setting metadata variables.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or outputs handling untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines variables and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated sections. All imports are from presumably legitimate local modules, and metadata is static.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets package metadata, including title, authorship, copyright, version, and imports several modules related to pattern matching and semantic grep functionality. It dynamically sets the copyright year and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data theft. The code is straightforward and typical of package initialization scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious or security risks identified. It does not perform any external operations, data handling, or insecure practices. No suspicious behavior or malware signals are present.",
