  "purpose": "CLI tool for scanning code or files for security issues using libsast.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for file paths, pattern files, and options; imports from libsast and standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "Output to file or stdout; sys.exit() calls; usage of subprocess-like functions is not present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed, used to configure a Scanner object, which performs the scan; results are outputted or printed; process exits with code 0 or 1 based on scan matches.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns; no dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a command-line interface wrapper around the libsast Scanner class. It parses user inputs, configures scan options, and outputs results accordingly. There are no external network calls, no handling of untrusted data beyond input arguments, and no code that executes dynamically or manipulates data in an insecure manner. The code appears to follow standard CLI patterns without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI interface for a static analysis tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the libsast library for scanning functionality. There are no anomalies or malicious activities detected in this code fragment.",
