  "purpose": "CLI tool for scanning code or files for security issues using libsast.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, file paths, and optional pattern files specified by the user.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON report to a file or stdout; exits with code 1 if certain scan conditions are met.",
  "flows": "User inputs → CLI argument parsing → options construction → scan execution → output handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is primarily a CLI interface for an existing scanner.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard command-line interface that sets up options for the libsast scanner based on user input. It reads input paths and optional pattern files, then calls the scanner's scan method. Output is formatted as JSON and saved to a file or printed to stdout. No code injection, dynamic execution, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The script handles exit codes based on scan results. The security is dependent on the underlying libsast scanner, but the CLI itself contains no malicious or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward CLI wrapper for the libsast scanner. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Its purpose is to facilitate code scanning with user-specified options. No suspicious activity or malware signals are present.",
