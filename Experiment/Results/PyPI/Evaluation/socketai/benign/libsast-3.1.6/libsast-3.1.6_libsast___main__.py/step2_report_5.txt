  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the `libsast` scanner.\n- No embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is evident.\n- The code relies on user input and the `Scanner` class for core functionality.\n- The code does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle sensitive data beyond file paths and options.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code appears correct and functional; no logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The `output()` function correctly handles JSON output and exit codes based on scan results.\n- Argument parsing is standard and appropriate.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are visible.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a CLI wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security risk: 0.2 — perhaps slightly high, but considering the code's benign nature, acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high, given the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identifies the script as a CLI wrapper.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security risk: 0.1 — very low, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others; confirms no malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states the code as a benign CLI wrapper.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same conclusion; no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but given the code's benign nature, these are acceptable. If anything, they could be lowered further to 0, but 0.1-0.2 is reasonable considering the context.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware or malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and clear.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — the code itself is low risk; the only concern could be the security of the underlying `libsast` scanner, but that is outside this code's scope.\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\nAll reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No adjustments needed. The code is a standard, safe CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious features.",
