  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for scanning files and directories for security issues using libsast.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, configuration options, and input file paths.",
  "sinks": "File output (json dump), sys.exit(), and print statements.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → options dictionary → Scanner.scan() method → output results to file or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages command-line input, prepares options, invokes a Scanner object to perform security scans, and outputs results. It uses standard libraries (argparse, json, sys). No untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations beyond file paths and configuration inputs. The 'Scanner' class is imported but not shown; however, it is likely responsible for performing the core security analysis. The script does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation code. It simply manages inputs and outputs. The code appears well-structured for a CLI interface without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as a secure, legitimate CLI wrapper for a security scanning tool. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected.",
