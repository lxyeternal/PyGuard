  "purpose": "CLI utility for scanning files or directories for security issues using libsast scanner.",
  "sources": "Input data from command line arguments (paths, options). Reads configuration from optional YAML pattern files or sgrep rules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs scan results to file or console. Exits with status code based on scan findings.",
  "flows": "Command line input -> Scanner configuration -> Scan execution -> JSON report generation -> Output or exit.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses standard libraries; no malicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a CLI interface for the libsast scanner. It parses arguments, configures the scanner, and outputs results. It does not perform any data processing or network activity itself. All operations are typical for a security scanning tool. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be well-structured and straightforward, serving a legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate CLI wrapper for a security scanner with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain attack mechanisms. It does not contain hidden backdoors, data theft, or malicious network activity. The code is safe based on current analysis.",
