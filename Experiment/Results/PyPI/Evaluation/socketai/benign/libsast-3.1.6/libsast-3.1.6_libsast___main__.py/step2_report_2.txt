  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a CLI wrapper around the `libsast` scanner.\n- It handles argument parsing, configuration, invoking the scanner, and output.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The `Scanner` class's internal implementation isn't shown, but the wrapper itself appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; describes the CLI purpose and flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; the code is a legitimate CLI wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Comments:** The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; similar to Report 1.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; it's a standard CLI interface.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Comments:** Slightly lower risk score, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Comments:** The zero risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Comments:** Slightly higher risk score, but still consistent with a benign CLI wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Comments:** Appropriate low risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional considerations:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the core scanner logic isn't present; the wrapper merely manages inputs/outputs.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's surface.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, given the code's benign purpose and lack of suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n## **Final conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the potential for misconfiguration or the underlying scanner, but not from the wrapper itself)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, and the reports' evaluations are justified.",
