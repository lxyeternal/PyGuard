  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the libsast static analysis scanner, managing argument parsing, configuration, and output handling.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, configuration files, and options passed to the Scanner class.",
  "sinks": "Outputting JSON results to a file or stdout; exit codes based on scan matches.",
  "flows": "Arguments are parsed, options are assembled, Scanner.scan() is invoked, results are output, and program exits based on scan matches.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward argument handling and output logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface that delegates core scanning to the imported Scanner class. It performs argument parsing, constructs options, calls the scan method, and outputs results. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of sensitive data is present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The exit codes reflect scan results, and the overall structure is typical for CLI tools. The security of the overall system depends on the implementation of the Scanner class, which is outside this code's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI wrapper around the libsast scanner. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
