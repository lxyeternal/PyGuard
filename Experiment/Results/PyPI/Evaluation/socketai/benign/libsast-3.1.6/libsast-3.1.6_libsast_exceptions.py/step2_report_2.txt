  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The classes serve as error indicators within the `libsast` static analysis framework.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n   - The conclusion that the code is harmless and standard is justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for exceptions; no malicious activity.\n   - Risk scores are correctly set to zero, reflecting no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious behavior, payload, or suspicious activity is present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code's purpose and nature accurately.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n   - The conclusion of no security risk aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign and serves as a structured error handling mechanism within the `libsast` project. The reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are needed.",
