  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception` and a base class `LibsastError`.\n   - All classes are simple, with constructors that pass or initialize with a message.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network activity, dynamic code execution, or external interactions.\n   - The code serves as an error handling framework within the libsast static analysis tool.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No suspicious or unusual code constructs.\n   - The classes are purely for categorizing errors, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity or payloads.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is straightforward and clear.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Claims**:\n   - The reports consistently confirm the benign nature of this code.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious activity; the analysis is based on the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a standard, benign exception class hierarchy.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n   - No modifications or concerns are necessary based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is entirely benign and serves a typical purpose within a larger application framework.",
