{
  "purpose": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling within the libsast static analysis framework.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and inheritance structures; no external data input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines classes without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, serving as error indicators within libsast. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The classes are simple, with constructors that pass or initialize messages. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. The code is standard and benign, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception hierarchy with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
