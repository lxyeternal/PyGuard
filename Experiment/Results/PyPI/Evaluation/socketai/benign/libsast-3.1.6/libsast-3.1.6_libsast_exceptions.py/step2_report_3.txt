  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that these are benign class definitions. No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The exception classes inherit properly from the base Exception class, and their purpose is clear.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward class definitions.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0 or very low, which is justified. The code poses no security risk.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score. The risk is effectively zero.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is harmless.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and match the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard set of custom exception classes, serving as error indicators within the libsast project.\n- There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern present.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the current scoring reflects that accurately. No further action or concern is necessary.",
