{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the libsast library to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all classes are defining exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output processing; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. Each class provides specific context for errors related to YAML parsing, rule loading, pattern matching, etc. There is no data input, output, network communication, or code execution occurring. The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling modules, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign exception handling module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves to categorize and raise specific errors within the libsast library and does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.",
