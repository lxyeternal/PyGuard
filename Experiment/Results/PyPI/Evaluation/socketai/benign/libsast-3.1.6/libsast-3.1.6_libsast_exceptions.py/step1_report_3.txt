  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the libsast project related to rule parsing, loading, and processing errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only contains class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from the base Exception class, with no input/output, network activity, or data manipulation. It serves as a structured way to handle errors within the libsast project. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and benign set of custom exception class definitions for error handling. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
