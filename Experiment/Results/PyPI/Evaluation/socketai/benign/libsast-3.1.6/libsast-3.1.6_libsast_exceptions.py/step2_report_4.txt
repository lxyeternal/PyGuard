  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base `LibsastError`, which itself inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - All classes are straightforward, either defining an `__init__` method or using `pass`.\n   - There are no data processing, input/output, network calls, dynamic code execution, or other operational logic.\n   - The purpose is to categorize and handle specific error conditions within the `libsast` static analysis framework.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - The code is purely class definitions for exception handling.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - No external data access, network activity, or code injection points.\n   - The structure and syntax are standard Python, with no signs of hidden payloads or backdoors.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Potential Vulnerabilities**:\n   - Given the nature of the code, the risk is minimal.\n   - Exception class definitions do not introduce security vulnerabilities by themselves.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent or malicious payloads.\n   - The code is safe, benign, and serves as a foundational error handling mechanism.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity or behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — Exception definitions alone do not pose security risks.\n\n5. **Review of Reported Scores**:\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, which is appropriate.\n   - The analysis and conclusions in each report correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n6. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - No. The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the benign nature of this code.\n\n**Final Summary & Recommendations**:\n- The code is purely for error categorization within the `libsast` project.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**My personal estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
