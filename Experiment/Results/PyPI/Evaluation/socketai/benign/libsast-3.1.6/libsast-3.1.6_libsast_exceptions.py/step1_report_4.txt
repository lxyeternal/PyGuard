  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the libsast security analysis framework.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; code consists solely of class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no potential data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely class definitions with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class. All classes are simple and only serve as identifiers for specific error conditions within libsast. There are no functions performing data processing, network calls, or system modifications. The code is standard Python exception class definitions with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining exception classes for error handling within libsast. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity detected.",
