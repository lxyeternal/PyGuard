{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the libsast library to handle various error conditions related to YAML rules and pattern matching.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external data handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not contain data flows or logic beyond class definitions and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions, with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class, LibsastError. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. The classes are simple and standard, serving as structured error indicators for a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard Python exception class patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of harmless exception class definitions used for error handling in the libsast library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
