  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the libsast project.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are not instantiated or used here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from the base Exception class. All classes are simple and only define constructors or pass statements. There is no handling of external input, no network activity, no file access, and no dynamic code execution. The classes serve as error types for the libsast project, which appears to be a static analysis tool. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns in this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign; it simply defines custom exceptions without any malicious intent or security issues.",
