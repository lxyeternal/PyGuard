  "purpose": "Helper functions for managing pattern rules, downloading patterns, removing comments from code or markup, and validating files.",
  "sources": "Reads input from URL via requests.get, reads local files and directories, and processes string data.",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.get for network communication, reads files from disk, manipulates string data, potentially replacing comments in code or markup.",
  "flows": "Downloads pattern rules from URL or reads from local files/directories; processes string data to remove comments; reads files to check size and extension.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. Comment removal logic is standard; no unusual or malicious code detected. No dynamic code execution or obscure features.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard helper functions for managing pattern rules and comment removal, including downloading YAML patterns via HTTP(S), reading local YAML files or directories, and stripping comments from code or HTML/XML content. It also includes file validation based on extension and size. The network request is simple and includes error handling. No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The comment removal functions do not execute code, and the overall structure is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate helper functions for pattern rule management and comment removal, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious network activity. The security risk is minimal, mainly related to network and file handling, which is standard. No malicious behaviors identified.",
