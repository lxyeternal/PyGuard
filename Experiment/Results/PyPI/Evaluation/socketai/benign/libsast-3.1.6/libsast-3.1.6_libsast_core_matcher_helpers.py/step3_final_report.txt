{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for rule fetching, comment removal, and file validation in security analysis tools.",
  "sources": "HTTP(S) requests to download rules, filesystem reads for YAML files, regex matches for comment removal.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static data processing.",
  "flows": "Download rule content via requests.get; read YAML files; process data with regex replacements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and patterns; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions: downloading rules with error handling, reading YAML files from local or remote sources, removing comments via regex, and validating files based on extension and size. No code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. External requests are handled safely, and comment removal preserves URLs and tags. The functions are straightforward, with appropriate safeguards. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for static analysis and rule management, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The network activity is typical for rule fetching, and the code structure is clear and safe.",
