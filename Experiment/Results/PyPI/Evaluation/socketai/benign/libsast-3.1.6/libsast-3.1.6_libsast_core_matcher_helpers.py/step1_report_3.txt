  "purpose": "Helper functions for pattern matching, comment removal, and rule management in security analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Download via HTTP(S) in 'download_rule'; file system reads in 'get_rules'; reading file contents in 'read_yaml'; string data in comment removal functions.",
  "sinks": "Returning downloaded or read data; data processing functions that modify or analyze string content.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data -> 'download_rule' -> 'read_yaml' -> 'get_mapping'; file content -> 'read_yaml' -> 'get_mapping'; data strings -> 'comment_replacer' and 'strip_comments' functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'requests.get' without any authentication, but this is standard; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected; no obfuscated code present. Functions are straightforward utility helpers.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for fetching pattern rules via HTTP or filesystem, and for stripping comments from code or data. The 'download_rule' function fetches external data with a timeout and raises exceptions on failure, which is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The 'get_rules' function processes local or remote YAML files for pattern matching rules; no malicious behaviors are evident. Comment removal functions are designed to sanitize data for analysis purposes. No code snippets perform actions like network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code were found. Overall, the code appears to be part of a security tool with standard utility functions, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of utility functions for rule retrieval and comment removal, implemented in a straightforward manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment. It appears to be a benign component of a larger security analysis framework.",
