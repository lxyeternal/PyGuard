{
  "purpose": "The provided code offers utility functions and classes for data structures, dict manipulation, and list distribution, intended for general use in Python applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameters in functions (e.g., dictionaries, lists, objects) and from imported modules. No external untrusted input sources or network calls are directly evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data is used in a dangerous or insecure way, such as executing system commands, writing to files, or network communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters (e.g., dictionaries, lists, objects) into internal processing, with no indication of untrusted data being exploited or leading to malicious outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard utility functions with no apparent malicious or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Usage of external modules is standard for such utility code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various utility classes and functions for data handling, such as DumbObject, Counter, unique, copy_keys, split_dict, and others. These functions perform standard data processing tasks without external dependencies or risky behavior. No network operations, system modifications, or obfuscated code are present. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads. The code appears to be well-structured and straightforward, with comments and usage examples indicating benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for data manipulation and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be safe for use, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated elements.",
