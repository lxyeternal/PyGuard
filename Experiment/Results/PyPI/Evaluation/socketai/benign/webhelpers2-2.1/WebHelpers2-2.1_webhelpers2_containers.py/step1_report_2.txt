{
  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for handling collections, dictionaries, and list distributions in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters to functions, such as dictionaries, iterables, objects, and lists. No external data sources or network inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious external communication. The code does not write data to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments (e.g., dicts, iterables, objects) through internal processing and returns new data structures; no external sinks or network operations involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. Usage of standard Python features and straightforward implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides collection utilities such as object containers, counters, unique element extraction, dict key copying, splitting, reordering, deletion, and distribution. It uses standard Python modules (`collections`, `sys`, `six`, `webhelpers2.misc`). All functions operate on provided data structures without involving external or untrusted sources. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or malicious code constructs are identified. The functions are designed for safe data manipulation, and no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions and classes for collection handling with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs standard data processing tasks safely and transparently.",
