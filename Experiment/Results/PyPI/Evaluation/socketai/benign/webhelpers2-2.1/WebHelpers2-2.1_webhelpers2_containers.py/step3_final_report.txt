  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for data handling, such as containers, counters, dict manipulations, and list distributions, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, class attributes, local variables; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external system interactions, network connections, or data leaks; all operations are in-memory and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Data flows within functions from inputs to outputs; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and classes for data structures and list/dict manipulations. There are no external data sources, network operations, or system modifications. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard in approach. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, as there are no malicious actions. The obfuscated score is zero, reflecting clarity. The risk score is very low, consistent with benign utility code. All signals indicate a safe, standard library of data handling functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
