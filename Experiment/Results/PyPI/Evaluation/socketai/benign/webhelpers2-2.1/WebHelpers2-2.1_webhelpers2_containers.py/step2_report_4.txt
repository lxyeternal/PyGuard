  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is utility classes/functions with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, and confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code. No issues with the logic or scoring.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard utility functions with no external or malicious interactions. Malware score is 0, confidence is 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard utility code with no malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, confidence is 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—benign utility functions, no malicious activity. Malware score is 0, confidence is 1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments—benign, utility-focused code, no malicious patterns. Malware score is 0, confidence is 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign utility code.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n\n### Final Step: Estimating my own scores based on the analysis.\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll evidence points to no malicious activity. **My estimate: 0.0**\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nNo obfuscation detected. **My estimate: 0.0**\n\n**Risk score:**  \nGiven the benign nature, straightforward implementation, and lack of external dependencies or malicious patterns, the overall risk is minimal. **My estimate: 0.1**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign set of utility functions/classes for data manipulation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The existing reports and scores are accurate and consistent with my assessment.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| **0.0** | **0.0** | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects a very low security concern, aligned with the detailed analysis.",
