  "purpose": "Provide constants for geographic regions including UK counties, country codes, US states, territories, and Canadian provinces for use in web forms and selection menus.",
  "sources": "Reads static string data for country codes; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations involving external data sources or user inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. Functions simply return predefined constant lists.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large static dataset of country codes with an unusual format, but no indication of malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors. The 'text_directly_from_iso_website' variable is a static string, used only for data initialization. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No network calls, no data exfiltration, or code that could send data over the network.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple functions returning static, predefined lists of geographic constants. The country_codes() function loads a large string with country data, parses it into tuples, and caches it, but this is standard static data processing. No external input, user data, or environment variables are used or manipulated. The code contains no code injection, no external network calls, no credential handling, and no suspicious activity. The only potentially unusual aspect is the large embedded dataset, which appears purely informational. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of static geographic constants with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward data provisioning for use in web forms. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is detected.",
