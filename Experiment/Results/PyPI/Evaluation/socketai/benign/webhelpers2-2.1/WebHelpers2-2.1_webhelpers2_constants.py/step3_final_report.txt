{
  "purpose": "Provides static geographic constants such as UK counties, country codes, US states, US territories, and Canadian provinces for use in web forms and other applications.",
  "sources": "Embedded static strings and lists within the code, notably the large string in country_codes() that is parsed into tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static data is processed internally without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Static data definitions and parsing functions process embedded strings into data structures; no external data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Large embedded static string for country codes; parsing includes error handling but no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static data definitions with minimal processing. The country_codes() function parses a large static string into tuples with proper error handling, indicating safe processing. No network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are detected. The static datasets are sourced from reputable references and are standard for constants modules. The exception handling ensures data integrity but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, with scores reflecting no malicious or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static constants module providing geographic data. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and risk score at 0.",
