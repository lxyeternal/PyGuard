  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is static data with minimal processing, primarily defining constants for geographic regions. The only dynamic aspect is parsing a large embedded string of ISO country data, which is done carefully with error handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score justification:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The overall security risk is also 0.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is safe, static, and intended for constants provisioning.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static data and straightforward parsing of embedded country code data. No external data fetches or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk score justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is static data with minimal processing, focusing on geographic constants. The large string parsing is straightforward.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware detected.\n- **Risk score justification:** Malware score remains 0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on static data and the parsing of the country code string.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk score justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static data, straightforward parsing, no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware detected.\n- **Risk score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is purely static data with minimal processing. No dynamic code execution, no external network calls, no user input handling, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Zero; the code functions as a constants provider.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Since there's no malicious activity, all security risk scores should be 0.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign static constants module with no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The detailed parsing of embedded country data is standard for static data initialization and does not pose security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, well-structured, and suitable for use in web forms or similar applications.",
