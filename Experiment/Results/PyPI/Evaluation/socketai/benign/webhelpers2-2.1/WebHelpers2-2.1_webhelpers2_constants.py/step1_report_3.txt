{
  "purpose": "Provides constants and functions to retrieve lists of geographic regions, such as UK counties, country codes, US states and territories, and Canadian provinces, for use in web forms and applications.",
  "sources": "The country_codes() function reads a large multiline string containing country names and ISO codes; other functions return static lists defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "The country_codes() function processes external data but does not send or write data outside of returning structured lists. No direct sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code reads embedded text data in country_codes(), processes it into a list of tuples, and returns static lists in other functions. No untrusted data flows outside the scope.",
  "anomalies": "The country_codes() function contains a large embedded string with country data and performs complex parsing with error handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static data definitions and simple data processing routines for geographic region lists. The only dynamic operation occurs in country_codes(), where a multiline string is parsed into a list of tuples. This parsing is straightforward and does not involve any external network or file I/O. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are detected. The code appears to be a well-structured utility module for geographic constants.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module offering geographic constants for web form use. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated/malicious code within this snippet.",
