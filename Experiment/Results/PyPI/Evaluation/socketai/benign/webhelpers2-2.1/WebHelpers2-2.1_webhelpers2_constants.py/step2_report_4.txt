  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** The code provides static constants for geographic regions, with data sourced from embedded static strings and lists. The only external data is the ISO country code data, which is parsed locally.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted input or output; data flows are static and internal.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** The large embedded ISO country data is parsed into tuples with error handling, but no malicious intent is evident. Exception handling is present for malformed data, which is good practice.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, primarily static data with safe processing. No malware, obfuscation, or security risk is detected.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** All describe static data definitions for geographic regions, with a similar focus on the embedded country code string parsed into tuples.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data, no user input, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** The large static dataset appears purely informational. No obfuscation, no secrets, no malicious code, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** All these reports agree that the code is a benign static constants module with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\n---\n\n**Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- The code is a static constants module providing geographic data for web forms.\n- The only dynamic processing involves parsing a large static string into tuples, which is straightforward and safe.\n- No external data fetching, no user input handling, no network activity, no code injection, no obfuscation.\n- The embedded country code data, while large, is static and processed safely.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**              | **0**      |\n\nThese scores are consistent with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\n- The only minor concern could be if the embedded large dataset is malformed or intentionally obfuscated, but the code includes error handling and appears straightforward.\n- The code's purpose is purely static data provisioning, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, static constants provider with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should remain at zero across the board.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
