  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the details therein.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily static data definitions: lists of geographic regions, country codes, US states, US territories, and Canadian provinces.\n- The only dynamic processing occurs in `country_codes()`, which parses a large embedded string into a list of tuples.\n- No user input, network activity, or external data sources are involved.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The embedded data appears to be sourced from reputable datasets (ISO country codes, US postal abbreviations, etc.).\n- Exception handling in `country_codes()` is based on data format assumptions but is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **No issues are present** in the code logic or data. The parsing is straightforward, and the data is static.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static and benign.\n- Some mention the large embedded string and parsing logic as potentially error-prone but do not consider this malicious.\n- No report suggests any actual vulnerability, backdoor, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is accurate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All assign `0` or `0.1`. Given the benign nature, `0` is appropriate; a small `0.1` might reflect minor concern about data parsing but is not justified as a security risk.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- No higher scores are justified. The code is static, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n### Consistency and anomalies:\n\n- The large static string in `country_codes()` is unusual but not malicious. It’s a common pattern for embedding static data.\n- No suspicious control flow, dynamic code execution, or external data fetching.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a benign constants module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\n- **The code is safe and free of malicious activity.**  \n- **No changes to scores are necessary.**  \n- **The detailed parsing logic and static data are standard for such utility modules.**  \n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's nature.",
