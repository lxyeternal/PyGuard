{
  "purpose": "The code provides constants and functions for retrieving lists of country codes, US states, US territories, and Canadian provinces, likely for use in web forms or data validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data embedded within the script, such as country codes from a large multi-line string, and predefined lists for US states, territories, and Canadian provinces.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is used for security-critical operations such as database queries, network communications, or shell commands.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve static data parsing and returning predefined lists; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual runtime behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward data definition and retrieval functions. The only potentially unusual aspect is the handling of the large string for country codes, but it is used solely for parsing static data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for static data lists related to geographic locations. The country_codes() function parses a large string of country names and ISO codes, which could be error-prone but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no external input sources or network interactions. The data handling is standard and static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code structure is simple and clean, with clear separation of data and functions. No indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign data repository for geographic constants used in web forms. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The large string parsing for country codes is a typical approach for static data embedding and does not suggest malicious intent.",
