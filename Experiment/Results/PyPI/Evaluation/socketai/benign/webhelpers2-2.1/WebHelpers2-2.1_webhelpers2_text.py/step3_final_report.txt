  "purpose": "A collection of string manipulation, sanitization, and formatting functions for text, HTML, and URL processing.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, external libraries (unidecode, webhelpers2), regex replacements, string slicing.",
  "sinks": "Regex-based entity conversions, string slicing, URL encoding, HTML tag stripping.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through regex substitutions, transliteration, and formatting functions with no external system or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of regex for sanitization is standard but could be misused if inputs are maliciously crafted HTML entities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for string and HTML sanitization, URL-safe transformations, and text formatting. It uses standard libraries and regex replacements, with optional transliteration via 'unidecode'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external system interaction. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and typical for sanitization and formatting tasks. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. External dependencies are benign and used safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for string processing, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal potential misuse of regex-based sanitization. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety for supply chain use.",
