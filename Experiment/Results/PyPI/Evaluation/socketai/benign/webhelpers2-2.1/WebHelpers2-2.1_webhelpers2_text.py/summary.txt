  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for string processing, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal potential misuse of regex-based sanitization. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety for supply chain use."
