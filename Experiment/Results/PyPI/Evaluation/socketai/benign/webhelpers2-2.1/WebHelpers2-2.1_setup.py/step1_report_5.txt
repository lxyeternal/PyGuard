  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the WebHelpers2 Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and test command integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements, setup() function parameters, and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "The code flows from imports to setup configuration, with no data passed from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The use of try-except for importing modules is standard. No dynamic code execution or suspicious imports are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, dependency management, and test command configuration. It imports standard and third-party libraries in a conventional manner. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or behavior. The dependencies are common and trusted. There are no hidden or suspicious code segments, no network activity, and no data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package configuration and dependencies, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
