  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script, no malicious intent.\n- Sources: Import statements, use of __version__, standard setup().\n- Sinks: sys.exit() in run_tests(), setup() call.\n- Flows: No untrusted data flows; internal execution.\n- Anomalies: Reliance on __version__ could be a concern if tampered, but as shown, it appears standard.\n- Analysis: No dynamic code, obfuscation, or network activity. The code is typical for packaging.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or security risks detected.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly elevated but justified due to reliance on external version info)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Package setup, standard.\n- Sources: Modules, version info.\n- Sinks: pytest.main, setup().\n- Flows: No untrusted data influence.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script, no dynamic code or network activity.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Packaging and testing.\n- Sources: Imports, version info.\n- Sinks: pytest.main, setup().\n- Flows: No untrusted data influence.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard setup.py pattern.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Package configuration.\n- Sources: Imports, setup parameters.\n- Sinks: setup(), pytest.main().\n- Flows: No untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Package setup.\n- Sources: Imports, setup().\n- Sinks: setup(), no other sinks.\n- Flows: No untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard packaging code.\n- Conclusion: No security risks.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of concern:** All reports describe standard setup scripts with no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Version import (`__version__`):** Could be a minor concern if the module is compromised, but nothing indicates tampering here.\n- **Malware assessment:** All reports correctly assign malware score 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** All are straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to reliance on external version info, but standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reported scores are reasonable, and I agree with the assessments provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No changes needed to the given scores.\n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk.",
