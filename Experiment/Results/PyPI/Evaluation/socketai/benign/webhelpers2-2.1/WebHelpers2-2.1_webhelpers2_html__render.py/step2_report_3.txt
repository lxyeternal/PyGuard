  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code provides HTML to text conversion and sanitization functions.\n- They highlight that the code uses standard libraries (`html.parser`, `six`) and performs straightforward parsing, formatting, and tag stripping.\n- No suspicious external network activity, credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- The functions are described as safe, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and all reports assign malware scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** No logical errors or security flaws are identified. The code is well-structured for its purpose.\n- **Scores assigned:** Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Malware:** No malware detected.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a standard HTML parser and sanitizer with no malicious features.\n- The use of `html.parser.HTMLParser` is safe; no dynamic code execution or external calls.\n- The sanitization simply strips tags, a common security practice.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign functionality, a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (to reflect minimal inherent risk, mainly due to parsing and sanitization functions, which are generally safe but could be misused if integrated into a larger system with vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code is a legitimate, safe utility for HTML rendering and sanitization. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe for use.\n\n---\n\nIf you have further questions or need a more detailed security analysis, feel free to ask.",
