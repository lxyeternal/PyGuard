{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for converting HTML to formatted text and sanitizing HTML by removing tags.",
  "sources": "HTML input strings processed via html_to_text() and sanitize() functions, and internal handler classes.",
  "sinks": "Processed data within parsing handlers; no external sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "HTML input → parsing handlers (HTMLRenderer, HTMLSanitizer) → formatted text or sanitized output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries (re, textwrap, six, html.parser) for safe HTML parsing and sanitization. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The functions perform straightforward operations: parsing HTML, formatting text, and stripping tags. No malicious indicators or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for HTML to text conversion and sanitization. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1–0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
