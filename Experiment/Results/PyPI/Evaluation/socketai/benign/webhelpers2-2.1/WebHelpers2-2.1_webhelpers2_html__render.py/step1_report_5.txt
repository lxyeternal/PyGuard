  "purpose": "A utility for converting HTML content into plain text and sanitizing HTML by stripping tags, intended for formatting and security purposes.",
  "sources": "Input HTML content received via function parameters in 'html_to_text' and 'sanitize'; no external data sources or untrusted inputs other than function calls.",
  "sinks": "Output generated by 'html_to_text' and 'sanitize'; internal functions process data, but there are no sinks that send data over network or write to files.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data flows into parsing functions ('html_to_text' and 'sanitize'), which process and produce sanitized or plain text output without external system calls or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code solely performs HTML parsing, sanitization, and text formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions and classes for parsing HTML, converting it to text, and sanitizing inputs by removing tags. It uses standard Python libraries and the 'six' compatibility library. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward, focusing on safe HTML handling and text rendering. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present. Overall, the code is designed for safe HTML processing with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for HTML to text conversion and sanitization, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not include any network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The implementation appears safe and suitable for use in security-sensitive environments.",
