  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of issues, reasoning, scoring, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, well-structured HTML parser and sanitizer.\n- No suspicious behaviors, external network activity, or obfuscation is detected.\n- The purpose is to convert HTML to text and strip tags for security.\n- No credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code uses standard libraries (`html.parser`, `six`) and standard practices.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across reports.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting benign utility functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes in reasoning:\n- **No logical flaws** are evident in the reports. They correctly identify the code as a benign HTML parser and sanitizer.\n- The reports correctly note the absence of network activity, external dependencies, or obfuscation.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's content and behavior.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign **0**, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign **0**, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) in some reports, which is reasonable given the utility nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nThe scores are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for high risk scores (>0.5):  \n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5, which is correct.  \n- The code does not perform any risky operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis.  \n- Given the code's straightforward nature, this assumption is justified. No hidden malicious behavior is suggested or detectable.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment and scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and understandable.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, reflecting its utility nature but acknowledging minimal inherent risk in parsing/sanitization functions.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard implementation of HTML parsing and sanitization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Workings are complete, and no further action is necessary.**",
