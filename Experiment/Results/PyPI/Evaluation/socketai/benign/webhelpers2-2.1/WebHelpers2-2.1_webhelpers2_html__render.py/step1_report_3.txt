{
  "purpose": "A module for rendering HTML as formatted text and sanitizing HTML by removing tags, primarily for display or security purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads HTML input via the 'html' parameter in 'html_to_text' and 'sanitize' functions, and from sys.stdin in the main() function.",
  "sinks": "The 'html_to_text' and 'sanitize' functions output processed text, but do not write to external systems or perform network actions. Data flow within the code is limited to processing input and generating text output.",
  "flows": "Input HTML flows into 'html_to_text' and 'sanitize' functions, where it is parsed by 'HTMLRenderer' or 'HTMLSanitizer'. The parsed data is then transformed into plain text or stripped of tags, respectively. No external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements. It uses standard libraries for HTML parsing and text manipulation. There are no suspicious dynamic code executions, network connections, or data exfiltration routines.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily provides safe HTML parsing and sanitization functionalities. It imports 'six' and uses 'html_parser.HTMLParser' which is standard. The sanitization method strips tags but retains content, reducing risk of malicious code execution. The 'html_to_text' function generates plain text output suitable for display. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or access sensitive data. The overall structure is consistent with legitimate text processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign HTML renderer and sanitizer with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within parsing and text formatting, with no external or covert activities.",
