  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides functions `html_to_text()` and `sanitize()` for converting HTML to formatted plain text and for sanitizing HTML by removing tags.\n- Uses Python's `html.parser.HTMLParser` (via `six`) for parsing.\n- No external network, file, or environment interactions.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code, or dynamic code execution.\n- Well-structured, standard library-based implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; functions for HTML to text and sanitization.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious external calls or backdoors.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies benign behavior; no malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; security risk is zero.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; functions process HTML input.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No external connections or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes the absence of malicious behavior, code injection, or network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-justified; no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (some minor caution due to potential misuse of sanitization but overall safe).\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No external system calls, network, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Properly states that the code is a safe parser and sanitizer.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or external connections.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately describes the code as benign, with standard parsing and sanitization.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal, justified).\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, network, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Accurately states the code is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (appropriate).\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign zero, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior**. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.2 (very low; primarily a utility module with no external risks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard implementation of HTML parsing and sanitization, with no security threats or malware. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
