  "purpose": "Provide functions for converting HTML to formatted text and sanitizing HTML content by stripping tags while preserving text.",
  "sources": "Input HTML string provided to html_to_text() and sanitize() functions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no direct data leaks, network activity, or external system calls observed.",
  "flows": "HTML input is parsed by HTMLRenderer and HTMLSanitizer, transforming or cleaning the content without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. The code is a straightforward HTML parser and sanitizer. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external connections present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only safe modules (re, textwrap, six). It defines functions for HTML rendering and sanitization, which parse and process HTML content without executing arbitrary code or making network requests. The classes implement standard parsing and text formatting logic. No functions access environment variables, perform insecure database operations, or include malicious behaviors. The sanitize() function simply strips tags, which is a common security practice to prevent XSS. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of HTML parsing, formatting, and sanitization with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as a utility module for safely processing HTML content.",
