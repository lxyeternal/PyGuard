  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check for inconsistencies, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- **Purpose:** All reports agree that the code provides functions for converting HTML to formatted text and sanitizing HTML by removing tags.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Inputs are HTML strings, processed via classes/methods (`html_to_text`, `sanitize`, handlers in `HTMLRenderer`, `HTMLSanitizer`), with outputs being formatted text or sanitized HTML.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity is observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports conclude the code is a benign utility for safe HTML parsing and sanitization, with no malware or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of malicious code:\n\n- **Code review:** The code strictly uses standard libraries (`re`, `textwrap`, `six`, `html.parser`) for parsing, formatting, and sanitization.\n- **Malicious indicators:** No network calls, no code obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no credential handling, no data exfiltration routines.\n- **Functionality:** The functions perform straightforward parsing, formatting, and tag stripping.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears entirely benign and intended for safe HTML processing.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Comments/Justification |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0            | No malicious activity, no obfuscation, very low risk. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0            | Same as above; no malicious behavior. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0            | Clear, straightforward parsing/sanitization. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0            | No malware, obfuscation, or security risk. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0            | Consistent benign assessment. |\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, all scores are consistent with the analysis. No evidence suggests any malware or obfuscation, and the risk score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Malware scores:\n\n- All reports assign malware score 0, which is justified — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n\n- The code handles HTML parsing and sanitization; vulnerabilities could exist if, for example, the sanitization is incomplete, but the implementation is straightforward and uses standard practices.\n- No assumptions of vulnerabilities are made; the code is consistent with safe processing.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and critical review:\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- No discrepancies or suspicious claims.\n- The detailed analysis confirms no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional comments:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured HTML parser and sanitizer utility, with no signs of supply chain or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Category          | Score | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors observed.    |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Code is clear, uses standard libraries, no obfuscation.        |\n| Security Risk     | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.                |\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and appropriate for use in security-sensitive contexts. No modifications or warnings are necessary.",
