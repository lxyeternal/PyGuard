  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert HTML content to formatted plain text and to sanitize HTML by removing tags while preserving content.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML input from function parameters in 'html_to_text' and 'sanitize'; reads HTML data in 'handle_data' methods; reads from stdin in 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "Output strings generated by 'to_text' methods; sanitized HTML content returned by 'sanitize'.",
  "flows": "HTML input -> parsed by HTMLRenderer and HTMLSanitizer -> processed data -> returned as formatted text or sanitized string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections. Use of standard HTML parsing and sanitization without obfuscation. No external network calls or file operations beyond standard input reading. No suspicious code for malware, tracking, or privacy violations. No obfuscated code detected. The code is well-structured, standard, and serves a straightforward purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward HTML to text conversion and sanitization utility using standard libraries. It parses HTML, handles entities, and formats text with indentation and wrapping. It also sanitizes by removing tags while preserving text content. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The only potential concern is the use of a custom HTML parser, but it appears benign and intended for formatting purposes only. No obfuscated or malicious code is detected. Overall, the code is a benign utility for HTML processing with no security threats or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate HTML formatting and sanitization utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe parsing, formatting, and sanitization of HTML content. No malicious activities or security concerns are present.",
