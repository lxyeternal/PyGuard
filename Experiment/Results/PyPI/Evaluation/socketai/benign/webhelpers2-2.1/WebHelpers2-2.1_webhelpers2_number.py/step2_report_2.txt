  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of utility functions for numeric calculations, statistical measures, and data size formatting.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The functions perform straightforward mathematical and string operations.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign utility library.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard utility functions, reading only from parameters.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; functions are well-documented and straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, no external data or network activity.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; functions are standard utilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; operates only on inputs.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, utility functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, no external dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no external data flows.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; purely internal calculations.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Security Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely utility functions with no external or harmful behavior, the risk scores are appropriately low (0.0).\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, benign, and suitable for use in any project without security concerns.",
