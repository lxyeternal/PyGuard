{
  "purpose": "The code provides numeric helpers, statistical functions, and data size formatting utilities, primarily for formatting, calculations, and statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read input or data from external sources or untrusted input; they operate on provided parameters and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not output data to network, file, or external systems. It only returns formatted strings or numerical results.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as all operations are internal calculations or formatting based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The functions are straightforward mathematical and formatting utilities. The 'full_name' parameter default logic is slightly inconsistent but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple utility functions for statistical calculations, data size formatting, and number formatting. All functions rely on mathematical operations and string formatting with no external data inputs or outputs. No potential malicious code patterns such as network connections, code execution, or data theft are present. The code appears to be a standard utility library without suspicious behaviors. The only minor concern is the default parameter logic in 'format_data_size' where 'full_name' is set based on the length of 'unit', but this does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for statistical and data formatting tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indicators. It appears safe for use in larger projects, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
