  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for statistical calculations and data size formatting. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation. The functions are standard and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of the functions with no external data flow or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, no issues found.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard utility functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—functions are mathematical and formatting utilities, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** The functions are benign, with no external data flow or malicious behavior. Slightly inconsistent default parameter logic noted but benign.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a set of utility functions for statistical calculations and data size formatting. They do not perform any network operations, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscated logic.\n- **Malware Indicators:** No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The functions handle inputs carefully, with error handling for empty collections, and do not process untrusted external data sources in a harmful way.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — Code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured utility library with no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. It is safe for deployment and use.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0          |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0          |\n| Security Risk    | 0.0          |\n\nThis aligns with the consensus across all reports and the detailed analysis.",
