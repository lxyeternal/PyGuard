{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for numeric calculations, statistical analysis, and data size formatting, likely for general use in data processing or reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, such as sequences of numbers for statistical functions and numeric values for size formatting.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that send data to external systems, network, or storage, nor does it execute untrusted data or perform external calls.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data, as all data is processed locally within functions without external communication or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code consists of mathematical and formatting functions with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard mathematical and formatting utilities, including mean, median, standard deviation, and data size formatting. It uses safe, well-understood operations and includes no network activity, system modifications, or dynamic code execution. The statistical functions include basic error handling for empty data. Data formatting functions use standard math and string formatting techniques, with options for SI or binary prefixes. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be benign, offering utility functions for data processing and formatting without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not include any malicious or suspicious operations.",
