{
  "purpose": "Provide numeric helpers, statistical calculations, and data size formatting functions.",
  "sources": "Function inputs such as parameters for size, unit, and data sequences; standard library functions like math.log and sum.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output formatted strings or calculation results; mathematical operations; exceptions raised for invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters through calculations and formatting logic, returning results; no external data input or output streams involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code detected. Functions operate on inputs only.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) and data size formatting. No external data sources are accessed, and no untrusted data is processed in a manner that could lead to vulnerabilities. The functions perform mathematical operations, string formatting, and error handling appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a safe, utility module for numeric computations and formatting. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The functions are deterministic, operate on provided inputs, and do not perform any external network or system modifications.",
