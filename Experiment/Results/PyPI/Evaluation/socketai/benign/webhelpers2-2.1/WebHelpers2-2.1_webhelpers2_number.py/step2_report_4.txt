  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions for statistical calculations and data size formatting.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are mentioned.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified.\n- The functions operate solely on their inputs, with standard mathematical and string formatting operations.\n- The code appears well-structured, documented, and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is benign and performs standard utility functions without malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are indicated or evident.\n- Minor note: The default logic for `full_name` in `format_data_size()` uses `len(unit) > 1`, which is benign but slightly inconsistent with typical expectations. However, this does not impact security or malware risk.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score; the code is purely utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n\n### Consistency and reasonableness:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or secret handling.\n- The functions are deterministic and purely mathematical or formatting utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is a benign utility library.\n- No malicious or suspicious features are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the absence of any malicious indicators.",
