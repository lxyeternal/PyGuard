  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Functionality:** Utility functions for statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation, percent) and data size formatting (bytes, bits, SI and binary prefixes).\n- **Behavior:** Purely mathematical and formatting operations, no external data access, no network activity, no code execution, no obfuscated or malicious code.\n- **Reported Risks:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurate; functions operate on input parameters, no external or malicious data.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0. The confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same as above; functions process local data.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Correctly identifies the code as benign with no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Consistent; no external data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Valid assessment; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Straightforward utility functions.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Correctly identified as safe, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Clear; functions are local utilities.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns; minor default parameter logic in `format_data_size` (setting `full_name` based on `unit` length) is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** No malicious or obfuscated code detected; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-documented code.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely utility functions with no external dependencies or malicious intent, the risk score remains at 0 across all reports.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions handle errors gracefully (e.g., empty collections).\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of My Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all reports.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe utility library with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
