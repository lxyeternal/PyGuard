{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation, percent) and data size formatting (bytes, bits, SI and binary prefixes).",
  "sources": "The functions operate solely on their input parameters; no external data sources or network calls are involved.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects; it only performs mathematical and string formatting operations.",
  "flows": "Inputs are passed directly to functions, which perform calculations or formatting without external data flows or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Default parameter logic in 'format_data_size' (setting 'full_name' based on 'len(unit)') is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for statistical measures and data size formatting. It uses standard Python idioms, handles errors gracefully, and does not include any network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. All signals indicate benign, safe code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
