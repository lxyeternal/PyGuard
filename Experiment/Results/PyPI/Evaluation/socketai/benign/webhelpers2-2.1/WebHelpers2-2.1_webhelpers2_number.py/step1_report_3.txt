  "purpose": "Utility functions for numeric calculations, statistics, and data size formatting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; functions operate on input parameters or data passed to them.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way; formatting functions generate strings from numeric inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and formatted into strings; no external or untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard mathematical and statistical functions (percent, mean, median, standard deviation) with proper error handling for empty collections. Data formatting functions convert numeric sizes into human-readable strings, supporting SI and binary units with options for full names or abbreviations. All functions operate solely on their inputs, and there are no network operations, file manipulations, or untrusted data processing that could be malicious. The code appears to be purely utility-based, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of mathematical, statistical, and formatting utility functions with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is safe and not suspicious.",
