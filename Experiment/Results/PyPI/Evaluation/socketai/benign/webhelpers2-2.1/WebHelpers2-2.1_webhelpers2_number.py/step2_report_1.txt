  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides utility functions for statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation, percent).\n- Offers data size formatting functions supporting SI and binary units, with options for full names or abbreviations.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- Functions operate solely on provided inputs, with proper error handling.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review**\n\n#### **Presence of Malicious Code / Malware Indicators**\n- **Observation:** All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no network activity, external data leaks, or code that could be malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious behavior is present.\n\n#### **Obfuscation / Code Quality**\n- **Observation:** The code is clear, well-documented, and uses standard Python idioms. Minor default parameter logic in `format_data_size` (setting `full_name` based on `len(unit)`) is benign and does not indicate obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No obfuscation detected.\n\n#### **Scores Justification**\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0.0 — consistent with the code analysis.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0.0 — justified given the clarity.\n  - **securityRisk:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n  - **risk:** 0.0 or very close to it — appropriate, as the code is utility functions with no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Any deviations?**  \n- No, all scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**\n- The only minor point is the default setting of `full_name` in `format_data_size`. It defaults to `len(unit) > 1`, which is benign but slightly inconsistent with typical expectations. This does not impact security or malware risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (safe utility functions, no vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No need to adjust scores.\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
