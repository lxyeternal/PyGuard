{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to calculate and format the time difference between two datetime objects or timestamps into human-readable strings, such as '3 days and 4 hours ago'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from datetime objects (from_time, to_time), and from system time via time.time() when integers are provided as input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data externally. It only returns formatted strings based on internal calculations.",
  "flows": "Input timestamps or datetime objects (sources) are processed, converted into deltas, and used to generate descriptive strings (sinks). The flow is from reading input to output formatting.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual or suspicious code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external network calls are present. The code solely performs date/time calculations and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs datetime difference calculations, including handling leap years and approximate month lengths. It converts timestamps to datetime objects if integers are provided, calculates differences in various time units, manages negative deltas via carry-over, and formats output strings with optional rounding. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network interactions are observed. The functions use straightforward logic aligned with their intended purpose. No suspicious or malicious behavior or code injection vectors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for human-readable time difference formatting. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only potential concern is reliance on system time for timestamp calculations, which is standard practice and not malicious.",
