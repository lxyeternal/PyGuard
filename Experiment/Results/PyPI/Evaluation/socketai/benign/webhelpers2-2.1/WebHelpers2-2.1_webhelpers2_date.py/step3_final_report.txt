  "purpose": "Utility functions for calculating and formatting human-readable time differences between two datetime objects or timestamps.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'from_time' and 'to_time', which can be datetime objects or integers representing seconds; uses system time via time.time() for integer inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network activity, or file I/O; primarily returns formatted strings based on internal calculations.",
  "flows": "Input timestamps -> convert to datetime if needed -> compute differences -> handle carry-over and leap years -> format output string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation; reliance on system time is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard date/time difference calculations with careful handling of leap years, carry-over, and multiple granularities. It does not include any external communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The logic is clear, and no malicious patterns are present. The use of system time for integer inputs is typical for such utilities. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for human-readable time differences. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
