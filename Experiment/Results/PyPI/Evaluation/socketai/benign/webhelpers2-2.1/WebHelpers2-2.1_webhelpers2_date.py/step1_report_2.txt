{
  "purpose": "Provide human-readable descriptions of the time difference between two datetime objects or a timestamp and now.",
  "sources": "time.time() for current timestamp, getattr() for datetime components, input parameters from_time and to_time.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input timestamps -> conversion to datetime -> calculation of deltas -> string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. No unusual code patterns or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code processes date and time differences and formats them into human-readable strings. It uses standard libraries (datetime, time) for timestamp and datetime handling. It performs calculations of deltas, including leap year consideration, and handles carry-over between units (seconds to minutes, minutes to hours, etc.). No network calls, system modifications, or sensitive data leaks are present. The functions seem purpose-built for formatting time differences, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for time difference formatting with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It operates solely within the scope of date/time calculations and string formatting. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
