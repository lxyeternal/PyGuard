{
  "purpose": "This module provides helper functions to calculate and display the difference in time between two datetime objects in a human-readable format.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current time using time.time() for integer timestamp inputs, and accesses datetime attributes (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) from datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only performs calculations and string formatting without executing untrusted code or making network connections.",
  "flows": "Input timestamps (integers) are converted to datetime objects; differences are calculated through attribute comparisons; resulting deltas are processed for carry-over and then formatted into strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses current system time via time.time() for integer inputs, which is standard; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are observed. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of time difference calculations with human-readable output. It accurately handles leap years, carries over negative deltas, and supports various granularities. All operations are standard and do not perform any malicious actions. There are no indications of privacy violations, data exfiltration, or malware components. The use of system time for integer inputs is conventional for such utilities. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-driven time difference formatter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard calculations and string formatting without external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior.",
