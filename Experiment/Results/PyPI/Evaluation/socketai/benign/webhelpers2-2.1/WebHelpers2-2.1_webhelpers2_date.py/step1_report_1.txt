  "purpose": "Provides human-readable descriptions of the time difference between two datetime objects or timestamps.",
  "sources": [
    "from_time and to_time parameters in distance_of_time_in_words and time_ago_in_words functions",
    "datetime.fromtimestamp calls when inputs are integers",

  "sinks": [
    "None present; no data is written to external systems or network",
    "No use of environment variables or insecure data handling",
    "No file or network I/O"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input (from_time, to_time) → Conversion to datetime objects if integers → Calculations of deltas → Formatting of strings for output"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functions. The code performs standard date/time difference calculations without obfuscation or deceptive constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of date/time difference formatting, converting timestamps if necessary, computing differences across multiple granularities, handling carry-over logic for negative deltas, and constructing human-readable strings. It includes no network communication, no dynamic code execution, nor any other suspicious activity. The only potential concern is the use of system time in timestamp calculations, but that is standard for such functions. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility for displaying time differences in words. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
