{
  "purpose": "Provide HTML helper functions for generating form elements, links, tables, and head tags in web applications.",
  "sources": "Import statements; functions processing input parameters and generating HTML tags; class constructors and methods; string manipulations; data rendering functions.",
  "sinks": "HTML.tag calls (which generate HTML strings); string formatting; attribute setting functions; potential user input incorporated into HTML attributes and content.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., user parameters, record values) flows into HTML attribute and content generation via functions like link_to, select, checkbox, etc., often directly embedding user-controlled data into HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no code that performs network connections, file operations, or system modifications. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious string manipulations. The code primarily constructs HTML elements based on parameters, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple helper functions for HTML form elements, links, tables, and head tags. It performs standard data validation, escaping, and attribute setting without executing or evaluating untrusted code. The functions accept parameters that are incorporated into HTML strings or tag attributes, but they do not include any dynamic code execution or system interaction. The class 'Link' supports lazy rendering but only produces HTML based on attributes. The overall design is consistent with a secure helper library, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions do not handle sensitive information or perform actions beyond HTML generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of HTML helper functions and classes intended for generating web page elements. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage code, network operations, or security risks. The code appears safe and primarily facilitates HTML rendering, with no suspicious or harmful behavior observed.",
