  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of HTML helpers with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. It relies on external escape functions for security, which are presumed to be properly implemented. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external sanitization of user input. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.1, reflecting a very low but cautious estimate considering external data handling."
