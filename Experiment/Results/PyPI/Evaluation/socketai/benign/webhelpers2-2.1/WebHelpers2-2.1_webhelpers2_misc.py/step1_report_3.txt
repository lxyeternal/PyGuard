  "purpose": "Helper utility functions for various generic operations such as image scaling, counting, data conversion, flattening iterables, class introspection, exception formatting, warnings, and custom exceptions.",
  "sources": "None of the functions explicitly read input or external data sources. The code mostly operates on provided arguments and internal modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write data to external locations, send data over networks, or execute system commands. No sensitive data is handled or leaked.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present. The code performs in-memory processing based on inputs, without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward utility functions with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises generic utility functions used in a broader application context. Functions include image dimension calculations, counting predicate true elements, safe type conversion, recursive flattening of nested iterables, class subclass extraction, exception formatting, deprecation warnings, and a custom exception class. All functions utilize standard Python modules and do not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are evident. The code appears to be well-structured, intended for aiding application logic, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of harmless utility functions with no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective based on this analysis.",
