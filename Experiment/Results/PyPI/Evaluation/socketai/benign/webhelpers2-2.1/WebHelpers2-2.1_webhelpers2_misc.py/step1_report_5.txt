{
  "purpose": "Helper utility functions for data processing, type conversion, class introspection, exception handling, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (itertools, sys, traceback, types, warnings), 'six' library, and function parameters or global variables within functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly send data over the network, write to files, or access sensitive data. No apparent sinks for untrusted data manipulation or leakage.",
  "flows": "The code primarily performs data transformations, class filtering, exception formatting, and warnings. No flow of untrusted data to vulnerable sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward utility helpers with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for proportional image scaling, counting elements based on predicates, type conversions, recursive list flattening, class subclass filtering, exception formatting, warnings, and custom exception classes. All functions use standard Python constructs and libraries, with no indications of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network communications, or backdoors are present. The module is designed for safe, non-security-critical purposes, with no suspicious anomalies or potential attack vectors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe data processing tasks typical of helper modules, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
