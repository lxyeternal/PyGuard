{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for image scaling, counting elements based on predicates, safe type conversion, recursive flattening of iterables, class subclass filtering, exception formatting, issuing deprecation warnings, and defining custom exceptions with formatted messages.",
  "sources": "The functions read data from function arguments, iterables, class definitions, and exception objects.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows are internal within functions, from input parameters to return values or attribute settings, with no external data or system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of utility functions and classes with no external I/O, network, or system modifications. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The functions perform calculations, type conversions, iterable flattening, class filtering, exception formatting, warnings, and custom exception handling, all in a transparent manner. No suspicious patterns or behaviors are detected. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (around 0.1) is justified as the code could theoretically be misused if integrated improperly, but in isolation, it poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
