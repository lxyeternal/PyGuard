{
  "purpose": "Provides various utility functions and classes for general use, including type conversion, flattening iterables, class introspection, exception formatting, and warnings.",
  "sources": "None of the functions or classes directly read untrusted input; the code primarily defines utilities. The only potential source of untrusted data could be external input passed to user-defined functions or external modules if integrated elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks like network operations, file writes, or system calls are present. Functions such as format_exception and deprecate use warnings or exception formatting but do not perform risky operations themselves.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious behavior are evident within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is standard utility code with no obfuscated parts or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for calculations, type conversions, iterable processing, class introspection, exception formatting, warning issuing, and custom exception definition. All functions appear straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network access, or data exfiltration. The use of 'six' is to maintain compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or malware. The classes and functions serve typical utility purposes. The overall structure is standard and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of general utility functions and classes with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be safe and standard, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
