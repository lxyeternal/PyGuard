{
  "purpose": "Utility helper functions and classes for general Python programming, including type conversions, collection flattening, class introspection, exception formatting, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "No input data reading; the code mainly defines functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no functions handling external inputs or outputs, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform security-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides general utility functions for data manipulation, class inspection, and exception handling, with no indications of malicious behavior. Functions like 'convert' and 'flatten' are common and safe. The 'subclasses_of' function performs class introspection, which is typical in plugin architectures. No network operations, credential handling, or potentially malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions and classes without any signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
