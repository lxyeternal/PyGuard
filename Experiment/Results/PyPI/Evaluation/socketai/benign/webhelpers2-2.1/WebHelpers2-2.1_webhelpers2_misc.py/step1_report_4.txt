  "purpose": "Helper utility functions for data processing, type conversion, class introspection, and exception formatting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; all functions operate on input arguments, local variables, or internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; functions do not write to network, files, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow pathways indicating malicious activity are detected; functions operate locally and safely.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides general-purpose utility functions, such as calculating proportional heights, counting elements based on predicates, safe type conversion, recursive flattening, class introspection, and exception formatting. It includes a custom exception class and a deprecation warning utility. All functions follow standard, safe programming practices without any indications of malicious intent. The use of the 'six' library ensures compatibility across Python versions, but does not introduce malicious features. The code appears benign, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of safe utility functions intended for general use. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
