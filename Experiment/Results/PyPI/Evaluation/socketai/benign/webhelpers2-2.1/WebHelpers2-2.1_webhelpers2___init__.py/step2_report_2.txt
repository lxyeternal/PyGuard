  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as minimal, consisting of a docstring and a version assignment.\n- No input/output, data handling, or executable logic is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating high certainty in the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n**Confirmations and issues:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- There are no signs of data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose is solely documentation and version declaration, typical for package metadata.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware scores are all at 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are all at 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are all at 0, matching the benign nature.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made that could be challenged.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, benign, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely documentation and version declaration, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. It poses no security risk and contains no obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, and no changes to the scores are necessary.",
