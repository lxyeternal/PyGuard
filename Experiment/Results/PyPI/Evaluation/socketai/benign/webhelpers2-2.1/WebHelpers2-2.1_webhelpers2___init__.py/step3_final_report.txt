  "purpose": "The code serves as a module docstring describing WebHelpers2 and a version declaration, providing metadata for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The module docstring and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code contains no input/output or data handling that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is static documentation and version info without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive docstring and a version string assignment, with no functions, data processing, or network activity. It is a minimal, metadata-only snippet. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The confidence levels are high, and there are no anomalies or suspicious elements to challenge. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only documentation and version info, with no malicious or security concerns. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
