  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- A module docstring describing WebHelpers2 as a collection of functions for web and other applications.\n- A version string assignment: `__version__ = \"2.1\"`.\n\n**Security Analysis:**\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of documentation and a version variable.\n- No input sources, data processing, output sinks, or executable logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward module metadata snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.\n\n- **Scores assigned in the reports?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0  \n  These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Critical evaluation of the scores:\n- Since the code is purely documentation and metadata, the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), which is reasonable.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Could there be hidden malicious intent?**  \n  No. The code is transparent, with no dynamic or obfuscated parts.\n- **Could the version string be malicious?**  \n  Unlikely. It's a static string with version info.\n- **Is there any assumption about potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The reports correctly dismiss any such concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately conclude that the code is safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are justified and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
