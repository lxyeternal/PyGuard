{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for a Python package, including version, author, and release date information.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static string assignments only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only assigns static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs identified; the code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments containing package metadata such as version, author, and release date. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external communications are present. The metadata appears legitimate and typical for package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this code fragment. It is standard metadata assignment with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
