  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports describe static variable assignments for package metadata: VERSION, AUTHOR, RELEASED.\n   - The original code confirms this: it only contains these assignments with no additional logic, input/output, or dynamic code.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for package metadata.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0, which aligns with the code content.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the clear, static nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic operations, network communication, or input handling.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n   - The metadata appears standard and benign.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - No overreach or unwarranted suspicion is evident.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Overall,** all reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is a standard package metadata snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Maintain current scores** as they accurately reflect the code's benign nature.\n- **No changes needed** based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.",
