  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a Python package or module, including version, author, and release date.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned at the beginning of the code: VERSION, AUTHOR, RELEASED",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input sources present; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink pathways observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious activity detected; simple assignment statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments defining package metadata such as version number, author, and release date. No external data input, no processing, and no operations that could be malicious. The author info appears standard, and the release date is straightforward. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata snippet with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears to serve the purpose of documenting package information.",
