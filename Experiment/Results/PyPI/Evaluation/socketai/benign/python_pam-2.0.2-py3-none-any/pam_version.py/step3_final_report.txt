  "purpose": "Define package metadata including version, author, and release date.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for VERSION, AUTHOR, and RELEASED.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static constants only.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments without dynamic input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments defining package metadata. There are no dynamic operations, data flows, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code does not perform any actions beyond defining constants, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no malicious or obfuscated elements. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature.",
