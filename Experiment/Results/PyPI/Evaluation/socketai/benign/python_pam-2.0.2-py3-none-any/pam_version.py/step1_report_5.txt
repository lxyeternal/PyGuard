  "purpose": "Metadata definition for a Python package, specifying version, author, and release date.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned at the beginning of the code: VERSION, AUTHOR, RELEASED.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; this code only defines static metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic data processing or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed in the static assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string and date values to variables representing package metadata. There are no functions, no data input, no network operations, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard header or metadata snippet. No signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata declaration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is typical package information with no suspicious elements.",
