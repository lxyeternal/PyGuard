  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a Python package, including version, author, and release date.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data output present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or source-to-sink paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward assignment statements with no hidden or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata: version, author, and release date. No input handling, no external data reading, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious or malicious constructs are present. This is typical for package metadata configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static metadata information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely declarative and poses no threat.",
