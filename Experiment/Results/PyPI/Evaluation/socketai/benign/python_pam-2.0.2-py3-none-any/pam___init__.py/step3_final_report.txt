  "purpose": "A wrapper for PAM authentication, importing constants and delegating to an internal class for actual authentication logic.",
  "sources": "Environment version check, imports from internal module (__internals), and the internal class PamAuthenticator.",
  "sinks": "Delegation to PamAuthenticator's authenticate method; no direct sinks in this code.",
  "flows": "Code flow from environment check to import, then to singleton instantiation of PamAuthenticator, and finally to the authenticate method call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward code with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Python version check, imports numerous constants and a class from an internal module, and exposes an 'authenticate' function that delegates to an internal singleton instance of PamAuthenticator. It also defines a 'pam' alias for the class. The code is a standard wrapper with no obfuscation, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic. The core security concern depends on the implementation of PamAuthenticator, which is external and not visible here. Given the simplicity and transparency, the code itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard PAM authentication wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the correctness and security of the external PamAuthenticator class. The current malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk but acknowledging reliance on external code.",
