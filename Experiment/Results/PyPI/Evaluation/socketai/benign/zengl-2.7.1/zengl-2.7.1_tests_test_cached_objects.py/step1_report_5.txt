{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a rendering pipeline using the zengl library, creates images and depth buffers, and inspects the pipeline configurations for correctness and consistency.",
  "sources": "Input data is obtained from function parameters (ctx, color), and internally from zengl.inspect().",
  "sinks": "No clear sink where untrusted data is used in a security-sensitive manner. The pipeline configuration and inspection are read-only operations.",
  "flows": "The context 'ctx' initializes images and pipelines; inspected info flows from zengl.inspect() to assertions for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data flows. Shader code appears standard. No external inputs, network operations, or cryptic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to create rendering pipelines with vertex and fragment shaders, using provided color parameters. The test function creates images and depth buffers, then creates multiple pipelines with specific viewports and colors. It inspects these pipelines and performs assertions to verify shared and distinct attributes. The shader code is standard GLSL with a simple include for color. No external inputs are processed dynamically, and no network or file I/O occurs. The code appears focused on graphics pipeline setup and validation. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or potential injection points are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard graphics pipeline setup and validation using zengl. It does not contain any malicious intent or suspicious activity. It is safe based on the provided code snippet.",
