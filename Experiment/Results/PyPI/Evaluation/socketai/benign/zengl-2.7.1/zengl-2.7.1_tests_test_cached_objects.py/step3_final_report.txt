  "purpose": "Setup and test a graphics rendering pipeline with shader parameters using zengl.",
  "sources": "Shader includes for color injection, pipeline creation functions, and inspection calls.",
  "sinks": "Pipeline inspection outputs revealing internal pipeline states; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "flows": "Shader include 'color' injected during pipeline creation; inspection functions retrieve pipeline info; assertions verify pipeline consistency.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '#include' for shader parameter injection is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs multiple graphics pipelines with dynamic color parameters injected via shader includes. It performs inspections and assertions to verify pipeline states. No external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The shader includes are standard practice for parameter injection, and the inspection functions are typical debugging tools. The code is clear, straightforward, and aligns with standard graphics programming patterns. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor security risk score reflects the use of shader includes for parameter injection, which is common and not inherently risky. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
