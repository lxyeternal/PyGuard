{
  "purpose": "This code defines test functions to inspect and verify the properties of GPU resources (pipelines, images, buffers) using the zengl graphics library.",
  "sources": "The code reads resource attributes and properties from zengl objects such as pipeline, image, and buffer instances.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that send untrusted data or perform data leaks. The code does not write to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "The code creates GPU resources and then inspects their properties without any data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The shaders are simple and standard, with no obfuscated or malicious code. No external network operations or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively uses the zengl library to create and inspect GPU resources for testing purposes. All resource creation and inspection calls are local and related to GPU resource management. No external data inputs, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The shaders and resource handling follow standard patterns and do not exhibit any malicious or malicious-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely intended for testing and inspecting GPU resources within a graphics application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
