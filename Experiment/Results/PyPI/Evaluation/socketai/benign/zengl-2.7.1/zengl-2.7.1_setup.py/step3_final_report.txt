  "purpose": "Setup script for configuring the 'zengl' Python extension module with environment-based build flags and external resource embedding.",
  "sources": "Reads 'zengl.js' for macro embedding, 'README.md' for description, environment variables for build options.",
  "sinks": "Embedding 'zengl.js' content into macro 'EXTERN_GL' could be exploited if the file is malicious, but the code does not execute or evaluate it.",
  "flows": "Reads external files; embeds 'zengl.js' content into macro; sets build flags based on environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding external JavaScript code into a macro is unusual but not malicious; no code injection or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python extension module, with conditional flags and external resource embedding. No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present. The embedding of 'zengl.js' could be a vector if the file is malicious, but the script itself does not process or execute it dynamically. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with this assessment. External file trustworthiness is outside the scope of this code review but should be maintained.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with minimal security concerns. External file embedding poses a low risk if the file is trusted. No malicious or obfuscated code is present.",
