  "purpose": "Render a simple triangle using zengl, validate pixel output to ensure rendering correctness.",
  "sources": "numpy array defining vertex positions and colors, zengl buffer and pipeline setup, shader code reading static data.",
  "sinks": "GPU rendering pipeline, framebuffer, pixel readback buffer.",
  "flows": "Vertex buffer data -> GPU vertex processing -> fragment shader -> framebuffer -> pixel readback.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded data, external data fetches, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward GPU rendering of a triangle with static vertex data and simple shaders. It reads pixel data post-rendering for validation. No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated patterns are present. The shaders are standard, and the data is static. The pixel validation confirms expected output, indicating benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign rendering test with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
