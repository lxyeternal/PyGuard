  "purpose": "Render a simple colored triangle using the zengl graphics library and verify pixel output.",
  "sources": "np.array for vertex data, ctx.image for framebuffer reading, and ctx.read() for pixel data.",
  "sinks": "np.frombuffer(image.read()) which reads pixel data from the framebuffer.",
  "flows": "Vertex buffer data → GPU rendering pipeline → framebuffer image → read() buffer → numpy array.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Shader code appears standard, and no external data is fetched or transmitted.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a graphics context, sets up vertex data, compiles shaders, renders a triangle, and verifies output pixels. All steps are typical for a rendering task. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors are present. The usage of np and zengl is straightforward, and the pixel verification is standard for testing rendering correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign rendering test with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations for graphics rendering and pixel validation without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
