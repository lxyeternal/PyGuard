  "purpose": "Render multiple colored triangles using a GPU pipeline with different depth testing functions.",
  "sources": "User inputs, context object methods, shader code, image buffer reads.",
  "sinks": "Reading image buffer data into NumPy array for verification.",
  "flows": "Shaders generate vertex positions and colors -> pipeline rendering -> image buffer reading -> NumPy array comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Shader code appears standard; no obfuscation or dynamic execution observed. The image readback and assertions are typical for rendering tests.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a rendering pipeline with shaders that assign vertex colors and positions. It creates images and depth buffers, clears them, and renders with different depth functions. It then reads back the image data into a NumPy array for verification. No external inputs are processed insecurely, no network activity, no suspicious data handling, or malicious behavior observed. The code performs a standard rendering test without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical rendering test script utilizing GPU pipelines to draw colored triangles and verify output. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The analysis indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
