{
  "purpose": "Create and test reading from a multisampled image in a graphics context using the zengl library.",
  "sources": "Reading the image data with img.read() after setting clear values.",
  "sinks": "The img.read() function outputs image data, but this is standard for graphics API testing; no untrusted data input or leak points identified.",
  "flows": "The code sets clear values, clears the image, then reads pixel data, which is a typical image buffer operation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of a graphics library for image operations is typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a multisampled image, clears it to a known color, and asserts the read data matches expectations. No external data inputs, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be a straightforward test of the zengl graphics library functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple graphics image test without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign, intended use of the zengl library for image handling.",
