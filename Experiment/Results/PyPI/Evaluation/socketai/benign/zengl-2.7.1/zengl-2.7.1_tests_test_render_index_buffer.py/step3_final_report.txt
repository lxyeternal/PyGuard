{
  "purpose": "The code performs GPU rendering of a simple shape using zengl, then reads back pixel data for verification.",
  "sources": "Reads static vertex and index buffers, framebuffer pixel data.",
  "sinks": "Reads pixel data back into CPU memory for assertion; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Vertex data -> GPU buffers -> rendering pipeline -> framebuffer -> CPU readback for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward graphics rendering test with static data, simple shaders, and pixel verification. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The shaders and data are standard, and the pixel assertions confirm expected output. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code's structure and behavior are benign and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign GPU rendering test script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
