{
  "purpose": "This code is a boilerplate unit test scaffold for the 'OrganizationApplicationsIdpApi' class in the 'cybrid_api_id' package, intended for future implementation of API tests.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it only imports modules and defines test methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the test methods are placeholders with no logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard autogenerated test scaffold with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, autogenerated unittest template with no implementation, external calls, or data handling. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The structure is typical for API test scaffolds, and all security signals are absent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, autogenerated test scaffold with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
