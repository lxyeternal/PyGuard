{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the Cybrid Identity API Python client library, intended to package and distribute the SDK via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The script sources data from the package metadata (name, version, description, author, etc.) and the external dependencies listed in REQUIRES.",
  "sinks": "The script does not perform any data output or network operations directly; it only defines package configuration for installation.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows involving untrusted data; the flow is static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code follows standard setuptools packaging conventions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only standard packaging modules, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It does not include any code execution, user input, or network requests. It is a typical setup.py configuration file for Python package distribution, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script used for distributing a Python SDK for Cybrid Identity API. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and follows common patterns for Python packaging.",
