  "purpose": "Package configuration script for the Python SDK 'cybrid-api-id-python', defining metadata, dependencies, and setup parameters.",
  "sources": "Static import of setuptools, static variables for package metadata, dependency list, and setup() call with fixed arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from variables to setup() invocation; no dynamic or runtime data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard setup script with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script used for packaging a Python library. It imports only 'setuptools', defines static metadata such as name, version, description, author info, dependencies, and calls 'setup()' with these parameters. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The dependencies are standard packages with fixed versions, and the script does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python SDK. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky behavior. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
