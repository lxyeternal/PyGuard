{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package 'cybrid-api-id-python' that describes package metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, version, description, author details, dependencies, and package inclusion directives.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted or external input; all data appears hardcoded and static.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the script purely defines package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or handling of untrusted data; the script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies, with no evidence of malicious code or suspicious patterns. It lacks any code that processes external input, performs network requests, or executes dynamic code. The only dynamic elements are static variables for package info. The presence of detailed documentation comments and standard package setup procedures further supports benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It merely defines the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
