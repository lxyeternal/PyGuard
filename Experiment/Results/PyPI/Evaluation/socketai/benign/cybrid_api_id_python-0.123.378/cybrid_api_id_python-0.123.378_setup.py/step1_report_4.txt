  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration for the Cybrid Identity API client library, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, dependencies from the REQUIRES list, and imports setuptools functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code does not execute or process external input at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks that could cause security issues is present. The code only sets up package configuration and static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, utilizing standard libraries and static metadata. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity occurs. The dependencies are normal and do not introduce malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
