{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'cybrid-api-id-python', used to package and distribute the Cybrid Identity API SDK.",
  "sources": "The script sources data from static variables (NAME, VERSION, REQUIRES, etc.), external dependencies specified in 'install_requires', and package discovery via 'find_packages'.",
  "sinks": "The script writes package metadata and dependencies during setup; no untrusted data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The flow involves static configuration variables leading to package setup, with dependencies fetched during installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The script is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It declares package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. There are no dynamic or untrusted data inputs, no network activity, nor any suspicious code or behavior. The dependencies are well-known packages ('urllib3' and 'python-dateutil') with specified versions, and the code adheres to best practices for package distribution. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for the 'cybrid-api-id-python' SDK.",
