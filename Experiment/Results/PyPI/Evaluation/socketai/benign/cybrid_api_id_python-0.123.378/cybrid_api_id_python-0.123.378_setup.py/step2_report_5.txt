  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard, static setup.py script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling involving untrusted sources is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code relies solely on static variables, well-known dependencies, and standard setuptools functions.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk is also 0, as the script does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n- They correctly interpret the script as a standard setup configuration, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The confidence level is high (1), reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 aligns with the absence of any risky operations.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**\n- Given the static, benign nature of the code, increasing the malware or obfuscated scores would be unwarranted.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe, and well-structured package setup script.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
