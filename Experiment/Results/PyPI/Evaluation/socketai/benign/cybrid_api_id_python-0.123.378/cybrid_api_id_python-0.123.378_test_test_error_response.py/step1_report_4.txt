{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test stub for the ErrorResponse model in the cybrid_api_id package, intended for testing error response object creation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, unittest, cybrid_api_id, and its ErrorResponse model.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely sets up a test class without actual test execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard unit test scaffold with placeholders for actual tests. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a unittest.TestCase subclass for testing ErrorResponse. The test method is a placeholder with no actual instantiation or validation. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network, file, or environment variable operations. It contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. It appears to be a benign, incomplete test stub meant for future implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test scaffold for a model class. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected. It is an incomplete test setup with no active logic or external interactions.",
