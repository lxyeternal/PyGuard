{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test stub for the ErrorResponse model in the cybrid_api_id package, generated for testing the ErrorResponse class.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the imported modules sys, unittest, and cybrid_api_id, and the ErrorResponse class from the package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues; it only initializes classes and runs tests.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, defining a test class, and (commented out) instantiating an ErrorResponse object, which is benign.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior are present. The code is a typical test stub with no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and a package module, defines a basic unittest structure, and contains a placeholder test method. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data leaks. The commented-out instantiation indicates a test template rather than any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test stub for a data model, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be an auto-generated test placeholder for the ErrorResponse class.",
