  "purpose": "This code is a minimal Python unittest scaffold for the PostBankApplication model, auto-generated as a placeholder for future tests.",
  "sources": "No data input, external files, or network calls; only imports and class/method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; placeholder methods with no active logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of active code, no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard auto-generated structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, structural test stub with no dynamic execution, external interactions, or suspicious constructs. It serves as a scaffold for future test implementation and contains only standard imports and class definitions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
