{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test stub for the ApplicationWithSecretAllOf model in the cybrid_api_id package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements, the class definitions, and the comments within the file.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple test scaffold with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious behavior. The comments are standard documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a unittest class with setup and teardown methods, and a placeholder test method for the ApplicationWithSecretAllOf model. There is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. The code is typical for a generated test stub. It lacks any malicious payload, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated unit test scaffold with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It serves as a template for testing the model class and does not perform any harmful actions.",
