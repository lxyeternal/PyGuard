{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test scaffold for the ApplicationWithSecretAllOf model, intended for testing instantiation and future test development.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input or external data sources; imports standard modules and the model class.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external outputs, or system modifications; placeholder test method with no active logic.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the test method is empty, serving as a structural template.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior; standard generated scaffold.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated test stub with no active logic, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. It imports necessary modules, defines a test class with setup/teardown, and contains a placeholder test method. No data flows or external interactions are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting its benign, scaffold nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated unit test scaffold with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with its purpose and content. No adjustments are necessary.",
