  "purpose": "This code is a unit test scaffold for the PostUser model in the cybrid_api_id package, generated for future testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and defines a test class with setup, teardown, and a placeholder test method; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data; the code is static and structural.",
  "anomalies": "The test method is incomplete, containing only a commented line and a pass statement; no malicious or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated unit test stub with no active logic, data processing, or external interactions. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities. Its purpose is to serve as a placeholder for future tests, and it poses no security or malicious threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and non-malicious. It is a structural scaffold with no active or harmful behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with its nature.",
