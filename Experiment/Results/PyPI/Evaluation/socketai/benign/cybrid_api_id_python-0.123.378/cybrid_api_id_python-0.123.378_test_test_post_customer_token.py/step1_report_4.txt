  "purpose": "Unit test stub for PostCustomerToken model in cybrid_api_id package",
  "sources": "Imports sys, unittest, cybrid_api_id, and the PostCustomerToken class; no external data inputs",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no untrusted data processing, no external network calls or data leaks",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; test functions do not execute any code beyond object creation (which is commented out)",
  "anomalies": "Contains only a test stub with no implementation; no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and the specific model class; defines a test class with setup, teardown, and a test method that is currently a placeholder. The test method is commented out and does not perform any actions. No dynamic execution or external interactions are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, skeletal unit test stub with no active logic, external calls, or data processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
