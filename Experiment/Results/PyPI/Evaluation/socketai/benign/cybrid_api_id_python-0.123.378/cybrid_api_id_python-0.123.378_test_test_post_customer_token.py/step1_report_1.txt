  "purpose": "Unit testing stub for PostCustomerToken model in the cybrid_api_id package",
  "sources": "Imports sys, unittest, cybrid_api_id, and a specific model class",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code contains only test skeletons and imports",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a placeholder test with no implementation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python unittest skeleton for a data model. It imports modules, defines a test class with setup, teardown, and test methods, all of which are placeholders. No actual test logic, external communication, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be auto-generated or a template for future tests. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard unit test stub with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a scaffold for further testing and contains no suspicious or harmful code.",
