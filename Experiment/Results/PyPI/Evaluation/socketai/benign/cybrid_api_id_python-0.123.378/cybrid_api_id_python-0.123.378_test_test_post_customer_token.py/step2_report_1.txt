  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a unit test stub for the `PostCustomerToken` model within the `cybrid_api_id` package.\n- The code is primarily composed of import statements, class definitions, setup/teardown methods, and placeholder test methods with no active logic.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated, serving as scaffolding for future tests.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Analysis:**\n\n| Aspect | Evaluation |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Code presence of malicious activity?** | No. The code is a simple, incomplete test stub with no logic, network calls, or data handling. |\n| **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?** | No. The reports accurately describe the code as benign, autogenerated, and non-malicious. |\n| **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk)?** | All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and risk scores as 0 or very low, which is appropriate. |\n| **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?** | None. The code does not contain any security risks or malicious behavior, so high scores are unjustified. |\n| **Malware score justification?** | The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct given the benign nature. |\n| **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?** | The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as a scaffold with no active security issues. |\n| **Consistency of scores with the code?** | Fully consistent. No discrepancies observed. |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate.** They correctly identify the code as a benign, autogenerated test scaffold with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- **Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThe code is purely a template with no active logic or malicious intent. No further action is needed.",
