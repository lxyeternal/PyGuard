{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test stub for the PostCustomerToken model in the cybrid_api_id package, intended to test creation of customer token objects within the Cybrid API SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from the import statements (`sys`, `unittest`, `cybrid_api_id`, and its model), and the class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process user input, network data, or environment variables directly.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to class and method definitions with placeholders; no data flows from sources to sinks as no actual data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The test method is incomplete, with a placeholder comment and no actual object instantiation or logic. There is no evidence of code execution, dynamic code evaluation, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for unit testing and the API model, defines a test class with setup and teardown methods, and a test stub for the PostCustomerToken model. There are no active data flows, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or external dependencies being exploited. It appears to be a standard test scaffold generated by an OpenAPI code generator, with no malicious intent or harmful code present. The lack of implementation means it doesn't perform any operations that could pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated unit test stub with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a template for future tests and contains no harmful logic or sensitive data handling.",
