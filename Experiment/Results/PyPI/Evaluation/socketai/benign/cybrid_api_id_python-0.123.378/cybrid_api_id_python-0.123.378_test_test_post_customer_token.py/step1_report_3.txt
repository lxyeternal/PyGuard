{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test stub for the PostCustomerToken model in the cybrid_api_id package, used for testing API model construction.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports standard modules and the cybrid_api_id package. The only external data source would be via tests using the model, but no such code exists here.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or effects, as the code contains only placeholder test structure with no execution logic.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the test is not implemented; the structure indicates potential for model instantiation but currently does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal, standard unittest structure with no active logic, dynamic execution, or obfuscated elements. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, defines a test class with setup and teardown methods, and a placeholder test method. It appears to be a generated stub for unit testing the PostCustomerToken model. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, file operations, or data handling beyond basic imports and class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign unit test stub for a model class, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a code generation process and does not include executable logic or external data processing.",
