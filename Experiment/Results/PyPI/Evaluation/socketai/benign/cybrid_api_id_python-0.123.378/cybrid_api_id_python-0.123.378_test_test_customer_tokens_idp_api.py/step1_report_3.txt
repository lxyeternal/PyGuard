{
  "purpose": "Unit test stub for the CustomerTokensIdpApi class, designed to test creation of customer access tokens within the Cybrid platform SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for the 'unittest' module, the 'cybrid_api_id' package, and the 'CustomerTokensIdpApi' class from 'cybrid_api_id.api.customer_tokens_idp_api'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources to vulnerable or sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "No execution flows or function calls are present; the test class only initializes the API class but does not invoke any methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal boilerplate with no actual implementation, inputs, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unittest stub for the API client library, with no actual test logic implemented. It imports necessary modules, defines a test class with setup and teardown methods, and a placeholder for a test case. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or execution paths that could be malicious. The code does not perform any network communication, data processing, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, autogenerated test stub with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only serves as a template for further testing implementation. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security issues are present.",
