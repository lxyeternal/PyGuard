{
  "purpose": "This code defines a unit test stub for the CustomerTokensIdpApi API client in the Cybrid SDK, intended for testing creation of customer access tokens.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules, defines a test class, and initializes the API client instance. No external data sources or inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data output points that process untrusted data or execute actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the test method `test_create_customer_token` is empty and contains no logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate test class structure with no actual implementation. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal unit test scaffold automatically generated for the API client library. It does not execute any API calls, handle user data, or include dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated test stub with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions or data processing, serving solely as a placeholder for future tests.",
