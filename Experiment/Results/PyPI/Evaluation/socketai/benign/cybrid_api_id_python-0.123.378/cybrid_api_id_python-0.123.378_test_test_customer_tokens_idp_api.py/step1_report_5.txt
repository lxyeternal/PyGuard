{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test stub for the CustomerTokensIdpApi class in the cybrid_api_id package, intended to test the creation of customer access tokens.",
  "sources": "Imports the cybrid_api_id package and its CustomerTokensIdpApi class, initializes an API instance in setUp method.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data handling or external calls beyond standard API class instantiation.",
  "flows": "Initialization of API object in setUp, no actual API calls or data flows in the test method.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only a stub with no implementation; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test skeleton generated for testing API interactions. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or external calls beyond instantiating an API class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a placeholder for future tests.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, autogenerated test stub with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any harmful code or malicious behavior. It is safe and purely for testing API integration points.",
