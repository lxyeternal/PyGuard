{
  "purpose": "The code defines a unit test stub for the CustomerTokensIdpApi class of the cybrid_api_id package, intended for testing the creation of customer access tokens via the Cybrid API.",
  "sources": "The code imports the unittest module, the cybrid_api_id package, and the CustomerTokensIdpApi class. It creates an instance of CustomerTokensIdpApi for testing.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or output data. The code does not handle external data directly, nor does it perform any network operations or data processing.",
  "flows": "The code initializes an API object but does not execute any data flow from source to sink. The test method is a placeholder with no implementation, so no data flows occur.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward test stub with no input validation, data handling, or dynamic execution. There are no suspicious patterns, hard-coded secrets, or unusual constructs. It is boilerplate test code generated by an OpenAPI generator.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal unittest setup for a specific API class. It imports the necessary modules, creates an instance of the API class, and defines a test method that is currently unimplemented. There are no code injection, malicious behaviors, or security risks present. The code's structure suggests it is auto-generated and intended as a starting point for further testing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated test stub for the Cybrid API SDK. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. It is safe and not a supply chain security risk.",
