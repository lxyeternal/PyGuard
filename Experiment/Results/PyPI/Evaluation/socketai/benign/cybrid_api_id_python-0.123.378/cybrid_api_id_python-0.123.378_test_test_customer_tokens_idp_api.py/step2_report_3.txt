  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a unit test stub for 'cybrid_api_id', specifically testing 'CustomerTokensIdpApi'. It imports modules and initializes an API instance but reads no external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or network operations occur; the test method is empty.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** It’s a boilerplate, auto-generated stub with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, standard auto-generated code with high confidence (1), no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, a minimal unittest setup for the same API class, with no data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or external calls; the test method is unimplemented.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Boilerplate, auto-generated, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still no malware or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, a stub for testing creation of customer tokens.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Auto-generated, no suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence (1), no malware or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a minimal test stub for the API class.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or external network calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Boilerplate, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, with high confidence (1), no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, testing the API class with no actual data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard auto-generated placeholder code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence (1), no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports describe identical or very similar auto-generated test stubs. These are minimal, boilerplate classes meant for future implementation, with no execution of external code, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely structural, serving as placeholders for tests, with no active logic or external data handling that could pose security risks.\n- **Supply Chain Risk:** These are auto-generated test templates, not executable or malicious code, and do not introduce any supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward boilerplate code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security or supply chain risks identified.\n\n**Note:** While the reports assign a risk score of 0.5 or similar, that seems overly cautious given the benign nature of the code. These are standard test stubs with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, auto-generated test scaffold with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. It’s safe to consider these as low-risk, non-malicious templates intended for future test implementation.",
