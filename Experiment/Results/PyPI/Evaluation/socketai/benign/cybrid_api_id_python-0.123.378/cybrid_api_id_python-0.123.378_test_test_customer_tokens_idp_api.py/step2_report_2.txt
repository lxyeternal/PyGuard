  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a unit test stub for 'cybrid_api_id', with no external input.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or transmission occurs. The test method is unimplemented.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is a typical auto-generated placeholder, with no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is benign and safe is accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurately describing the minimal nature of the code.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow, no external data handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; boilerplate generated code.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, consistent description.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution of API methods or data handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard auto-generated test stub.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment of safety.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, minimal boilerplate.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data or external calls.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; placeholder code.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly assessed as benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with prior reports.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or external interaction.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, just a stub.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard auto-generated unit test stub, with no executable logic, no external data handling, and no network activity.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n- **Security Risk:** The code itself poses no security risk; it's a placeholder template.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk in this code snippet.  \n\n**Note:** These are consistent with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, auto-generated, and intended as a placeholder for further testing.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code snippets are safe, benign auto-generated test stubs with no malicious or security concerns. No changes to scores are necessary.",
