{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal, auto-generated unit test scaffold for the 'cybrid_api_id' SDK, specifically testing the 'CustomerTokensIdpApi' class. It sets up a test class with setup and teardown methods but does not implement any actual test logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules and initializes an API class instance.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows; no external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the test method is unimplemented.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard auto-generated placeholder with no malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, boilerplate test stub with no logic, data handling, or network activity. It does not process untrusted input, execute commands, or contain any suspicious patterns. Its purpose is to serve as a scaffold for future test implementation. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated test scaffold with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It poses no supply chain security risk and is safe for use. The current scores accurately reflect its harmless nature.",
