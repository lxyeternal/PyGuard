  "conclusion": "The script is a standard application downloader with potential security risks due to executing external commands and downloading from untrusted sources. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The main concern is the execution of commands from configuration files, which could be malicious if those files are compromised. Implementing command validation, checksum verification, and source authentication would mitigate these risks."
