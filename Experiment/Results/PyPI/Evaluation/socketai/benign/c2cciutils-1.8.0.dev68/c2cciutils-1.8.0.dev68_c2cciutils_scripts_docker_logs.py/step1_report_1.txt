  "purpose": "The script retrieves and formats Docker container statuses and logs for GitHub CI integration.",
  "sources": "Reading file '/tmp/docker-logs-timestamp', reading 'docker-compose.yaml', reading container names via 'docker ps --format', and environment checks.",
  "sinks": "Running 'docker' commands, reading/writing timestamp files, printing messages to stdout.",
  "flows": "The code reads the timestamp file -> constructs 'docker logs --since' parameter -> executes docker commands -> outputs logs and status messages.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of subprocess.run with check=False and check=True, potential reliance on existing timestamp file, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code logic. No obfuscated code detected. The script appears to simply automate Docker status and log collection.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard operations: checking for a compose file, listing Docker containers, updating a timestamp file, and fetching logs since last run. The subprocess commands use standard Docker CLI tools. No malicious network activity or code injection is evident. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The script's purpose aligns with CI/CD monitoring, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for collecting Docker container statuses and logs for CI purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The script does not perform any harmful actions beyond standard container management commands.",
