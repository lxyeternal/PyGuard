{
  "purpose": "The script lists Docker containers and fetches their logs, formatted for CI/CD integration with GitHub.",
  "sources": "Reads timestamp from /tmp/docker-logs-timestamp; reads container names via 'docker ps --format'; executes 'docker' commands for container status and logs.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing Docker CLI commands; reading/writing timestamp files; printing formatted output.",
  "flows": "Source: timestamp file read; container names obtained from 'docker ps'; logs fetched via 'docker logs' with timestamp filter; output printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with check=False in some calls, which suppresses errors; reliance on timestamp files without validation; no input sanitization for container names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Docker container listing and log retrieval, using subprocess calls and timestamp files for incremental logs. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of check=False may hide errors but does not introduce malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or secrets. The primary concern is operational error suppression, which does not elevate security risk. Overall, the script is a benign utility for CI environments, with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate Docker monitoring utility intended for CI pipelines. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain threats are evident. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by minimal operational concerns. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The code is safe and appropriate for use.",
