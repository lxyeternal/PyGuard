{
  "purpose": "The script is a utility main entry point for the c2cciutils package, providing options to display configuration and version information.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments ('--get-config', '--version').",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are 'yaml.dump' for outputting configuration and 'pkg_resources.get_distribution' for retrieving package version.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed; if '--get-config' is specified, 'c2cciutils.get_config()' output is dumped; if '--version' is specified, package version is retrieved and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and known package functions is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an argument parser with two options: displaying configuration and version. It calls 'c2cciutils.get_config()' to fetch configuration data and outputs it in YAML format. It also retrieves the package version via 'pkg_resources'. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code uses standard libraries and functions for its purpose, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility script for displaying configuration and version info from a package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
