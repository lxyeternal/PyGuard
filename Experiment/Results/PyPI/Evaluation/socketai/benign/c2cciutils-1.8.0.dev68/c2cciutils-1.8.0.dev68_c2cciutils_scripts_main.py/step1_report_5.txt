{
  "purpose": "The script is a utility main entry point for c2cciutils, providing options to display configuration and version information.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse; retrieves package version via pkg_resources; calls c2cciutils.get_config() to obtain configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data using print; potential risk if get_config() returns sensitive data or if arguments are manipulated, but no direct data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> conditional logic -> printing configuration or version info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles command-line arguments to display configuration or version info. It calls an external function c2cciutils.get_config(), which could potentially contain sensitive data, but the usage here is read-only for display purposes. There are no suspicious data flows, injections, or malicious actions. The package version is retrieved safely using pkg_resources. No backdoors, hidden network activity, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs configuration or version info based on user input. The security risk is minimal, assuming get_config() does not leak sensitive data.",
