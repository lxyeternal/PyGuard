  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code remains a simple CLI utility.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or risky behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to previous, standard CLI code.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small securityRisk (0.2), but no actual evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Justified given the potential if get_config() returns sensitive data.\n- **Justification:** The only minor concern is that get_config() could expose sensitive data, but this is not inherently malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to others, straightforward utility.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Same reasoning as above.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, but potential risk if get_config() leaks sensitive info.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with some at 0.2 due to potential exposure of sensitive data via get_config(). Given the code, these are reasonable, assuming get_config() is safe.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly theoretical if get_config() leaks sensitive info, but no evidence of actual vulnerability.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary. The code appears safe, benign, and standard for a CLI utility.",
