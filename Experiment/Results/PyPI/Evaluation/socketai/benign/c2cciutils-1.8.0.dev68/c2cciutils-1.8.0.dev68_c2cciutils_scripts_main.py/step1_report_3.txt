{
  "purpose": "The script provides command-line utilities for displaying configuration and version information for the c2cciutils package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--get-config, --version), and fetches configuration data via c2cciutils.get_config(), as well as package version via pkg_resources.get_distribution().",
  "sinks": "Output functions (print), data retrieval from c2cciutils.get_config() and pkg_resources, which could potentially be exploited if these functions are compromised.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments trigger data retrieval: '--get-config' flows from input args to c2cciutils.get_config() output, and '--version' flows from args to pkg_resources.get_distribution() to output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Usage of standard libraries and common practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing CLI options to display configuration and version info. It uses safe functions like yaml.dump with SafeDumper, and pkg_resources to retrieve package version, which are standard. No external or untrusted data sources beyond command-line arguments. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility module without any malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on well-known libraries and performs simple data output tasks, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
