  "purpose": "Display configuration data and version information for the c2cciutils utility.",
  "sources": "Function call to c2cciutils.get_config() and pkg_resources.get_distribution() for package version.",
  "sinks": "Output via yaml.dump and print statements, displaying data to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments influence whether configuration or version info is displayed; data flows from external functions to output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that parses arguments, retrieves configuration data via an external function, and displays package version info. It uses safe practices: yaml.dump with SafeDumper, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no network activity. The external function get_config() could, in theory, return sensitive data, but this is a design consideration rather than an issue within this code. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of standard libraries and clear structure indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security concern relates to the content of get_config(), which is outside the scope of static analysis. All signals indicate safe, straightforward code.",
