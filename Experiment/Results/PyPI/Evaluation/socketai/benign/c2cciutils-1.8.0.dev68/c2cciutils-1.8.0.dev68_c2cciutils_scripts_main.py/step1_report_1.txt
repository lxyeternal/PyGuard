  "purpose": "The script provides utility functions to display configuration and version information for the c2cciutils package.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments and retrieves package version information via pkg_resources.get_distribution.",
  "sinks": "The code prints output directly to the console, which is not a security sink but is standard for CLI tools.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments determine whether get_config() is called or the version is retrieved; data flows from argument parsing to function calls and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of yaml.dump with SafeDumper is appropriate and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to trigger specific actions: displaying configuration or version info. The config data is obtained via c2cciutils.get_config() and output as YAML. The version is retrieved securely using pkg_resources. There are no suspicious code behaviors, external network calls, or obfuscated code. Overall, it functions as a simple CLI utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for displaying configuration and version information. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and benign.",
