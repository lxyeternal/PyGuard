{
  "purpose": "The script is a command-line utility for displaying configuration and version information for the c2cciutils package.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command-line arguments processed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "The output is printed to standard output via print statements; no external sinks are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sources) influence the flow to either display configuration or version information, leading to print outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an argument parser, defines options to display configuration or version, and executes these options based on user input. It retrieves configuration via c2cciutils.get_config() and package version via pkg_resources. Both actions are standard and do not involve malicious activity or security risks. Usage of yaml.safeDump and safe loaders indicates secure handling of YAML data. The code appears to be a straightforward utility with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads command-line options, displays configuration or version info, and does not handle untrusted data insecurely.",
