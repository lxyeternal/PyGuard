  "purpose": "Utility functions for CI/CD workflows, including repository info retrieval, configuration loading, error reporting, version printing, secrets management, authorization handling, and GraphQL API interactions.",
  "sources": [
    "Environment variables (e.g., GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_TOKEN, CI, GITHUB_GRAPHQL_URL, C2CCIUTILS_TIMEOUT)",
    "Subprocess commands (git, gopass, version checks)",
    "File reads (ci/config.yaml, GraphQL query files)",
    "Network responses from GitHub API"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "Network requests to GitHub API (requests.post, response handling)",
    "Subprocess execution (git, gopass, version commands)",
    "Logging and print statements (warnings, errors, version info)",
    "Header modifications for authorization"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Environment variables or subprocess commands provide data (e.g., repository info, secrets)",
    "Secrets are injected into headers or used in subprocess commands",
    "Network responses are checked and processed, with errors raising exceptions",
    "Logs and error messages output status and warnings"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; standard use of subprocess, environment variables, and network requests. No obfuscation or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for CI/CD automation, handling repository info, configuration, error reporting, version checks, secrets retrieval, authorization, and GraphQL API interactions. It uses environment variables and subprocess commands in a standard manner, with error handling and logging. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The subprocess commands are used for legitimate purposes like git info and version checks, with no evident injection points or malicious payloads. Network interactions are limited to GitHub API requests, with proper response validation. Overall, the code appears safe, straightforward, and aligned with best practices for CI/CD utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate, standard utility functions for CI/CD workflows, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical environment variable and subprocess usage. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate given the context. No modifications are necessary.",
