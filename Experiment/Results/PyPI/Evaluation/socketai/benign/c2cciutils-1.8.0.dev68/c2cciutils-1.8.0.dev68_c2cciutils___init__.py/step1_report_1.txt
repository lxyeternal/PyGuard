  "purpose": "Utility functions for CI/CD workflows, including repository info retrieval, configuration loading, version printing, GitHub API interactions, and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_GRAPHQL_URL, CI, C2CCIUTILS_TIMEOUT); subprocess commands (git remote, gopass, version commands); file reads (config.yaml, GraphQL query files); network responses from GitHub API.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to GitHub GraphQL API; subprocess command execution; printing/logging of errors and warnings; modifications to headers including Authorization.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs provide data to functions like get_repository, get_master_branch, add_authorization_header, and graphql. Data flows from environment and subprocess outputs into network requests and logs. Response data from API responses is processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess for commands like 'git' and 'gopass' could be risky if inputs are manipulated, but no explicit dangerous code is found. The code handles sensitive data (tokens) securely via environment variables or gopass. No hardcoded credentials are present. No suspicious code obfuscation or hidden behavior. Logging of API responses is straightforward. No obfuscated or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for CI/CD tasks, fetching repo info, config files, printing versions, and interacting with GitHub APIs via GraphQL. It uses environment variables and subprocess commands responsibly, with error handling and warnings. The only potential concern is subprocess command execution, which could be exploited if environment variables or input data are maliciously manipulated, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. The functions do not perform any data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized network activity beyond legitimate API interactions. No signs of backdoors, data theft, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears designed for legitimate CI/CD automation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for CI/CD workflows with no evident malicious intent or malware. It manages environment variables, files, and network communications appropriately, with standard error handling. The overall security risk is very low.",
