  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is utility functions for CI/CD workflows, involving environment variables, subprocess commands, file reads, and network requests. The analysis states no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score seems appropriate given the functions' nature. No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's content. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed reasoning. It emphasizes that subprocess commands are standard, secrets are managed via environment variables or gopass, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The reasoning supports a very low malware and obfuscation score. The security risk is minimal, mainly due to environment variable reliance.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, utility functions with standard practices. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The code's straightforward nature justifies these scores.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard usage, proper handling of secrets, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The low scores are justified given the code's purpose.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on standard CI/CD utility functions, with attention to environment variables and subprocesses. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The code is typical for CI/CD scripts, with no signs of malware.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code is utility-oriented, with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports reflects minor concerns, mainly about environment variable handling and subprocess usage, which are standard in such scripts.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n- **Potential Adjustments:** None needed. The assessments are cautious and appropriate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a set of legitimate utility functions for CI/CD workflows with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low and primarily related to environment variable handling, which is typical in such contexts.",
