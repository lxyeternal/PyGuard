{
  "purpose": "To print environment information based on a configuration, likely as part of a system check or diagnostic tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and configuration data via c2cciutils.env.print_environment and c2cciutils.get_config().",
  "sinks": "The output is directed to the console via print_environment, which could potentially leak environment data if used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Configuration data retrieved by c2cciutils.get_config() flows into print_environment, which then outputs data to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "The code calls c2cciutils functions without validation or sanitization; however, this is standard for environment reporting. No unusual code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it sets up an argument parser, ignores command-line arguments, and calls a function to print environment info. The core functions used are from the c2cciutils package, which is external and not inherently suspicious. There are no indicators of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious command execution. The only potential concern is that environment information is printed, which could be sensitive if misused, but this is consistent with diagnostic tools. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple environment info printer with no apparent malicious intent. It is likely part of a diagnostic or CI/CD utility. No security risks or malware are detected.",
