  "purpose": "Print environment information using c2cciutils.",
  "sources": "import statements, especially c2cciutils.env and c2cciutils.get_config()",
  "sinks": "print_environment function likely outputs environment info, possibly sensitive data",
  "flows": "get_config() provides configuration data, which is passed to print_environment() for output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, standard argument parsing, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The script imports c2cciutils.env and calls print_environment with configuration data retrieved from c2cciutils.get_config(). It only prints environment info as per the description. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, designed solely to print environment information without any malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
