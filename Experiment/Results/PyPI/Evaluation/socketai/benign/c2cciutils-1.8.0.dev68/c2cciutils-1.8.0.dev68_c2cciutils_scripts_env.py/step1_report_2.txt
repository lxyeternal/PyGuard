  "purpose": "Prints environment information based on the configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data through c2cciutils.get_config() and environment details via c2cciutils.env.print_environment.",
  "targets": "Outputs environment information to the standard output; no untrusted data sink involved.",
  "flows": "get_config() supplies data to print_environment() which then outputs it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of external libraries appears legitimate. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward utility that utilizes c2cciutils to fetch configuration and environment details, then prints them. It does not process untrusted input, does not execute code dynamically, nor does it contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code is simple, with no anomalies or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as an environment inspector without any malicious intent or security issues.",
