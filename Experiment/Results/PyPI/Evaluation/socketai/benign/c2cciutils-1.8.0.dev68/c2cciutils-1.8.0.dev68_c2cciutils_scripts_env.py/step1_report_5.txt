  "purpose": "Prints environment information using a utility module.",
  "sources": "Imports from c2cciutils.env and c2cciutils.get_config() function call.",
  "sinks": "The function c2cciutils.env.print_environment potentially outputs environment data.",
  "flows": "The script calls get_config() and passes its output to print_environment, which may output environment data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external utility modules without visible input validation; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple command-line utility that uses the c2cciutils package to retrieve configuration and print environment details. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import statements and function calls are standard, and no untrusted input processing or network activity is evident. The code’s structure is simple and does not perform any suspicious actions beyond outputting environment info. No anomalies such as hidden code or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving only to print environment information using the c2cciutils utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
