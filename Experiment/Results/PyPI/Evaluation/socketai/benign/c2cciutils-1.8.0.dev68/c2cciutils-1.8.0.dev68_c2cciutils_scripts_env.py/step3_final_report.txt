{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to print environment and configuration information, likely for diagnostic or CI/CD purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external functions: c2cciutils.get_config() and c2cciutils.env.print_environment().",
  "sinks": "The print_environment() function outputs environment data, which could potentially leak sensitive information if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from get_config() to print_environment(), with no user input processed directly in the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and external utility functions, then calls these functions to retrieve and print environment data. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain suspicious patterns. External functions' implementations are unknown but appear benign. The code's simplicity and the external functions' typical use suggest no malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with this analysis, considering potential minor information leakage. Overall, the code is a benign environment reporting utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign environment information printer with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
