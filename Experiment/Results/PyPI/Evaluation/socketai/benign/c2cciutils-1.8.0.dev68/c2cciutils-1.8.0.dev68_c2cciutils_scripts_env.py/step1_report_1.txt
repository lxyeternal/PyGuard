  "purpose": "Prints environment information based on a configuration.",
  "sources": "The function c2cciutils.get_config() which retrieves configuration data, and c2cciutils.env.print_environment() which outputs environment info.",
  "sinks": "print_environment() outputs data; get_config() retrieves configuration data, potentially from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "get_config() → print_environment()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual logic detected. The code is straightforward, primarily calling library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports argparse for argument parsing but does not process any arguments beyond parsing. It calls c2cciutils.get_config() to retrieve configuration data, then passes this data to c2cciutils.env.print_environment() for output. The actual implementation of these functions is not provided; however, the code itself appears to be a simple utility for environment inspection. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple environment information printer with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. It relies on external library functions, but within this scope, there are no signs of malware or security concerns.",
