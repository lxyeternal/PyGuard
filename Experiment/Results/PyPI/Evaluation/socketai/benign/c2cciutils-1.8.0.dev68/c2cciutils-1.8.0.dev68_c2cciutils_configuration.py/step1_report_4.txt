{
  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures for a Kubernetes and related environment setup, including version printing commands and database settings.",
  "sources": "Constants and class attribute definitions that contain default values, hardcoded passwords, and command lists.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as 'auth.postgresPassword' in 'K8S_DB_CHART_OPTIONS_DEFAULT', and command lists that could be executed.",
  "flows": "Configuration defaults are set in constants; command lists may be used for execution. No direct execution, network, or data exfiltration code present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded password 'mySuperTestingPassword' in 'K8S_DB_CHART_OPTIONS_DEFAULT', which is a security concern. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures using TypedDict for configuration purposes. Default values are set, notably including a hardcoded database password which could be exploited if the configuration is exposed. No code execution, network calls, or obfuscated logic detected. Commands listed for cluster setup and version printing are standard and do not exhibit malicious intent. No dynamic execution or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily consists of configuration definitions with some hardcoded sensitive information. There is no active malicious behavior or malware present. The main security concern is the hardcoded password, which could lead to credential exposure if the configuration is improperly managed.",
