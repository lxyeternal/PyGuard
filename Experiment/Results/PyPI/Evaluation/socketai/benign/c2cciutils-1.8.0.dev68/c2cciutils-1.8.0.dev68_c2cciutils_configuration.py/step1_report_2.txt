  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures and default values for a Kubernetes cluster setup and related utilities.",
  "sources": "Constant default values, class attribute defaults, and hardcoded strings within the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines data schemas and default parameters without data flow logic or untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded database password 'mySuperTestingPassword' in default chart options; no other suspicious activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of TypedDict class definitions and default configuration constants. The only notable security concern is the hardcoded PostgreSQL password within 'K8S_DB_CHART_OPTIONS_DEFAULT', which could lead to credential leakage if used in production or shared environments. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not perform any runtime operations, network access, or dynamic execution that could be exploited maliciously. Overall, it appears to be a standard configuration schema with a minor security concern regarding embedded credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code mainly defines configuration schemas with default values. The hardcoded password is a security concern but does not indicate malicious intent. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected. The risk is low, with the primary concern being credential exposure if these defaults are used in sensitive environments.",
