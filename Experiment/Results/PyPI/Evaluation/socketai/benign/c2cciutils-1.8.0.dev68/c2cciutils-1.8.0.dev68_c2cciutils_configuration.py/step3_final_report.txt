  "purpose": "Defines configuration schemas and default values for Kubernetes and related tools, including version commands and credentials.",
  "sources": "Default configuration variables such as K8S_DB_CHART_OPTIONS_DEFAULT, which contain hardcoded passwords.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; static data used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded password 'mySuperTestingPassword' in default chart options.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static TypedDict class definitions and default configuration variables. The only security concern is the hardcoded password, which is a common placeholder but should be managed securely. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious behavior. Risk scores vary slightly based on the presence of default credentials but remain low. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration scaffolding with a minor security concern regarding embedded default credentials. No active malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
