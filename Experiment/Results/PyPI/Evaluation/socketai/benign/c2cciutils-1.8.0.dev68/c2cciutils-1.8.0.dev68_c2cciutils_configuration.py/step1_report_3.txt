{
  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures and default values for Kubernetes and related tools used in a deployment or CI/CD pipeline.",
  "sources": "The code defines static variables, class attributes, and default configuration values; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted input data are present. The code primarily deals with static configurations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as this is a static configuration module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets (except for a default password which is noted as a default value), or unusual constructs are observed. The only potentially sensitive data is the default password 'mySuperTestingPassword', but it's part of a default configuration comment and not actively used in code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of data structure definitions (TypedDict) and default configuration values for Kubernetes-related deployment. It contains no dynamic code execution, network calls, or input handling. The only noted sensitive string is a default password in comments, which is a common placeholder and not malicious. There are no obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code appears to be a typical configuration schema with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration schema with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It mainly consists of data structure definitions and default configuration values used for deployment or CI/CD processes.",
