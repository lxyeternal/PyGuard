  "purpose": "Define configuration schemas and default values for Kubernetes and related tools, including version printing commands.",
  "sources": "Configuration class definitions, default value variables, and comment annotations within the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static configurations and default commands.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded password 'mySuperTestingPassword' in default chart options is a potential security concern. The code contains comments indicating default values and possible configuration options but no direct executable or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of TypedDict class definitions for configurations, default value variables, and comment annotations describing intended usage. The only notable security concern is the hardcoded password in 'K8S_DB_CHART_OPTIONS_DEFAULT', which could lead to credential exposure if these defaults are used unaltered. No dynamic or executable code is present, and there are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be configuration scaffolding without active logic. Overall, no malicious intent or malicious code structures are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines configuration data structures and default values for Kubernetes and related tools. The only noteworthy security issue is the hardcoded password, which should be changed or secured in real deployment. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior within this code. The overall security risk is low, with a minor concern regarding hardcoded credentials.",
