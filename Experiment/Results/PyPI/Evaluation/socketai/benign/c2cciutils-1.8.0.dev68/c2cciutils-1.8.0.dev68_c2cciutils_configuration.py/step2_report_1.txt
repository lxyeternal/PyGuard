  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is predominantly static configuration schemas using TypedDict, default values, and comments.\n- The only notable security concern is the presence of hardcoded passwords (\"mySuperTestingPassword\") in default configuration variables.\n- No dynamic code, executable logic, or data flows from untrusted sources are present.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or active malware is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines configuration schemas and defaults.\n- **Main concern:** Hardcoded password in `K8S_DB_CHART_OPTIONS_DEFAULT`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just static defaults with a security concern about credentials.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0 (no malicious code). Risk score = 0.2 is reasonable, given the hardcoded password.\n\n**Recommendation:** The score aligns with the findings. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining configuration schemas with defaults.\n- **Main concern:** Same hardcoded password.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just configuration data with a credential concern.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.3 is acceptable, considering the credential exposure.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Configuration schemas, version commands.\n- **Main concern:** Default password in `K8S_DB_CHART_OPTIONS_DEFAULT`.\n- **Analysis:** No active code, no data flow, no malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar configuration definitions, including command lists and default passwords.\n- **Main concern:** Hardcoded password.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just static configuration.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.4 due to credential exposure.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Configuration data structures and default commands.\n- **Main concern:** Hardcoded password.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior. The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports indicate obfuscation; should stay at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The primary concern is the hardcoded password, which is a security risk but not malicious. The scores range from 0.1 to 0.4, which seems reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** (due to hardcoded credentials, which is a common security concern but not active exploitation)\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is primarily static configuration with a minor security concern regarding embedded passwords. No active malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the content.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security posture of this code is low risk, with the main issue being the use of default credentials, which should be managed carefully in deployment.",
