  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious utility for environment and version reporting. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The current low risk scores are appropriate, though they could be lowered further to zero given the benign nature. The malware score remains zero, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is minimal."
