  "purpose": "Define data structures for application configuration using TypedDict and Literal types.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only type definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; definitions are static and do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only type annotations and comments with no executable or malicious logic; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines data structures for application configuration using Python's typing module. It includes comments explaining each field but does not include any executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward schema definition without any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet that defines data types for application configuration. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard schema definition with no vulnerabilities.",
