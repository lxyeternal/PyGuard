  "purpose": "Static type definitions and constants for application configuration schema, with no runtime logic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Definition of TypedDict, string literals, and constants used for configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external input/output involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static schema definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated schema definitions with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, constants, and descriptive comments. It does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema for application configuration. No runtime logic, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. Given the absence of any malicious or security-compromising elements, the overall assessment confirms that the code is safe and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, static schema definition with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
