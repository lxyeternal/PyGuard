  "purpose": "Define application configuration schema for managing file download and processing parameters",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data is defined via static type annotations and dictionaries",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; no output or external data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only defines types and constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward type definitions and literals",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures using Python's typing module, specifically TypedDicts and Literals, for application configuration. There are no input, output, or external data processing components present. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or sensitive data handling is detected. The constants and type annotations are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static configuration schema with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
