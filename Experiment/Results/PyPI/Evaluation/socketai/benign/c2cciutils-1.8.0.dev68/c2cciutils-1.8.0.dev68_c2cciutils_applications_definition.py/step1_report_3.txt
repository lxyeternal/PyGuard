{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures for application configuration using TypedDict and type literals, intended for use in managing application deployment or packaging settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations and comments; no external inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or security effects, as no runtime data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs; the code is purely declarative and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward type definitions with no dynamic execution or embedded data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static schema definition for application configuration, involving type annotations and constants. It contains no functions, input handling, or dynamic behaviors that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The comments clarify purpose but do not introduce any security risks. There are no obfuscated code features, external inputs, or execution flows. The only potential concern could be if used improperly in a larger context, but as-is, this code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, static definition of data structures for application configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
