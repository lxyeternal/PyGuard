  "purpose": "Define structured data types for application configuration using Python TypedDict and literals.",
  "sources": "None; all data are type annotations and static definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "None; static type definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, input handling, or dynamic operations; all are static type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type definition for application configuration using Python's typing module. It defines TypedDict for structured configuration data, including URL patterns, file types, filenames, and commands. The code contains only static annotations, literals, and comments; no data processing, user input, or external data handling is present. There are no suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward schema definition, likely generated automatically from a JSON schema.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, non-executable configuration schema with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign definition of data structures for application configuration.",
