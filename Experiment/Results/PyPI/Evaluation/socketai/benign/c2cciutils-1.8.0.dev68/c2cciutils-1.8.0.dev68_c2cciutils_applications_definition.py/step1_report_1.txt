  "purpose": "Define data structures for application configuration using type annotations and schema validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module imports, type definitions, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "The code does not include data flow paths involving untrusted sources; it only declares types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears to be auto-generated documentation and type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, class definitions, and constants for configuring applications. There are no runtime behaviors, input handling, or external data processing. The structure is straightforward and typical for configuration schemas. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present. The comments suggest it is auto-generated documentation from a JSON schema, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless configuration schema definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only provides type hints and constants for application configuration, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
