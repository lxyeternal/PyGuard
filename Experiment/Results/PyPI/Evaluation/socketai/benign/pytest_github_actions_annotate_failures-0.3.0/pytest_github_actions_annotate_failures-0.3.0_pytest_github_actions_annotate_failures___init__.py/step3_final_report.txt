  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code indicators such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external files, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec), imported modules, input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into dynamic execution functions or network modules, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted input, obfuscation of variable names or code segments, absence of code in some reports, suspicious import patterns, hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally align with their scores. Report 2 exhibits dynamic code execution and obfuscation, justifying higher malware (0.4) and obfuscation (0.6) scores, with a moderate security risk (0.5). Other reports lack evidence of malicious activity, with scores of zero or low, consistent with their benign or incomplete nature. The confidence levels are appropriate given the available data. The overall threat assessment indicates low risk for most, with moderate suspicion in Report 2.",
  "conclusion": "The scoring and analysis are consistent and justified. The primary concern remains Report 2, which warrants monitoring due to its use of eval/exec and obfuscation. The other reports appear benign or insufficient for suspicion. No adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
