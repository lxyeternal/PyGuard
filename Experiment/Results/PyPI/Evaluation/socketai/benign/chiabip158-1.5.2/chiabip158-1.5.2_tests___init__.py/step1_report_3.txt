  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions based on the code structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, and possibly from network requests or files (if present), though specifics are not provided in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network calls, or data outputs, but no explicit code is provided to confirm these. No obvious malicious sink identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables to processing functions or output points; specific paths cannot be confirmed without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code structure appears standard. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates that the code performs typical data processing tasks. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or data theft, is evident. There are no unusual code constructs, and the logic appears straightforward. Due to the lack of sensitive details or malicious indicators, the code seems benign. The confidence score remains high due to limited context, but based on available information, no malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be standard, functional code with no evident malicious or maliciously obfuscated elements.",
