  "purpose": "Build configuration script for compiling a Python extension module 'chiabip158' using C++ and pybind11.",
  "sources": "Local C++ source files, setup.py configuration, platform detection, compiler flag checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "Compiler and platform-specific options configured during build; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building a C++ extension with Python, performing compiler feature detection, platform-specific configuration, and dependency management. It does not execute untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. All functions serve legitimate build purposes, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured build configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
