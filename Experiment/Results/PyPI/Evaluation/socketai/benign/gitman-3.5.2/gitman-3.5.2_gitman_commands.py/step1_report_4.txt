{
  "purpose": "Manage the installation, update, display, locking, and deletion of project dependencies, including configuration handling and script execution.",
  "sources": "Configuration loading functions (load_config), file system interactions in startfile, dependency info retrieval (get_dependencies, get_path).",
  "sinks": "Running scripts via config.run_scripts, file opening via startfile, logging output, modifying config files, deleting dependencies.",
  "flows": "Configuration and dependency data flow from load_config and get_dependencies to script execution, file opening, or deletion actions; user inputs influence which dependencies are operated on.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external functions without visible validation, such as startfile for opening config files, and direct dependency installation/update without explicit sanitization. No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily orchestrates dependency management tasks such as initializing configs, installing, updating, displaying, locking, deleting, and editing dependencies. It loads configurations, manipulates dependency sources, and executes scripts, all through clear method calls. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors, is present. The functions rely on external modules like log, common, and startfile, which are assumed safe and standard for such operations. There are no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. The code performs expected dependency management operations with proper control flow and does not execute untrusted data or perform unsafe operations. Overall, the code appears to be standard dependency management logic with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a dependency management utility with standard operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. The overall security risk is very low.",
