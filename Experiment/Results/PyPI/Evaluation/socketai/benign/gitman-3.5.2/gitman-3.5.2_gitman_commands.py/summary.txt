  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The external functions used are standard in dependency workflows and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low (score 0.2), justified by the potential but unsubstantiated risk from external script execution functions. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure."
