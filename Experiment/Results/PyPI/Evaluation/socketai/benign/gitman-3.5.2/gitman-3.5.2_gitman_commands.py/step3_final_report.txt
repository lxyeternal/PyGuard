  "purpose": "Functions to manage dependency installation, updating, display, locking, deletion, and editing within a project, primarily handling configuration files, repositories, and scripts.",
  "sources": "Loading configuration files, accessing dependency repositories, reading filesystem paths, invoking external script functions (e.g., run_scripts, startfile).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications, script executions, opening files via startfile, dependency locking and unlocking, dependency deletions.",
  "flows": "Configuration loading -> dependency operations (install/update/lock/delete) -> script execution or file opening, with potential external script calls acting as source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL patterns. External functions like run_scripts and startfile could execute arbitrary code, but are standard in dependency workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency management tasks, invoking external modules for script execution and file operations. No malicious patterns, network activity, or backdoors are evident. External functions could pose risks if malicious, but within this context, they are typical. The code is clear, well-structured, and lacks obfuscation. The security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The external functions used are standard in dependency workflows and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low (score 0.2), justified by the potential but unsubstantiated risk from external script execution functions. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
