  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a CLI wrapper that parses arguments and delegates commands to external functions (`_get_command`, `_run_command`).\n   - No direct code execution, network activity, or file manipulation occurs within this script.\n   - The code appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The reliance on external functions means the core logic and potential risks depend on those implementations, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is straightforward; no evident errors or flaws are present.\n   - Default command is set to \"install\" if none is provided, which seems reasonable.\n   - Argument handling appears consistent, with mutually exclusive groups and appropriate help messages.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are evident here.\n\n3. **Score Review & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the code's function.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9), reflecting the clear and standard implementation.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious activity or code obfuscation, so the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Behavior & Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code only delegates to external functions, the real security concern would be in those functions.\n   - However, based on this code alone, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is a typical CLI wrapper.\n\n5. **Consistency & Final Assessment:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the code's nature, I agree with the assigned malware and obfuscated scores of 0.\n   - The overall security risk remains low.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, primarily due to delegation to external functions which are not shown)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign CLI wrapper for managing Git dependencies. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident within this snippet. The overall security posture is low risk, assuming external functions are secure and trustworthy.",
