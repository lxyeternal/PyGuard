  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for managing Git dependencies, parsing user arguments and delegating commands.",
  "sources": "User input arguments parsed via argparse; external functions _get_command and _run_command",
  "sinks": "Delegated functions potentially executing commands based on parsed arguments",
  "flows": "Parsed arguments passed to _get_command, then to _run_command for execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; reliance on external functions is noted but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that sets up argument parsing for dependency management operations. It delegates core functionality to external functions, which are critical points but outside this code's scope. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The default command is set to 'install', and argument handling appears correct. External functions could pose risks if insecure, but within this module, no issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and standard for a dependency management CLI. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The overall security risk is minimal, assuming external functions are secure. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0; the security risk score can be confidently set at approximately 0.1.",
