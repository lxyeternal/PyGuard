{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface for a Git plugin called 'git deps' that manages dependencies using Git.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via argparse and imports functions from local modules (__version__, common, _get_command, _run_command).",
  "sinks": "The code calls external functions _get_command and _run_command which may execute commands or handle dependencies; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident within this code.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed, processed, and passed to _get_command and _run_command, which likely execute system commands or manage dependencies based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard argument parsing with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or unusual code constructs. It does not execute untrusted code directly; reliance on external functions (_get_command and _run_command) is noted but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a CLI wrapper for dependency management operations. It handles user input securely via argparse, does not perform any direct file or network operations, and delegates core functionality to imported functions. No suspicious code patterns, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present within this module. It relies on external modules for actual command execution, which warrants review of those modules for completeness but not in this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a CLI frontend for dependency management. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are detected in this module. The overall security risk is low, assuming imported modules are secure and trustworthy.",
