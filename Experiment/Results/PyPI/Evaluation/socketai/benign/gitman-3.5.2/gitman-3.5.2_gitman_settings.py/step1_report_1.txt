  "purpose": "The code initializes default configuration settings for cache, logging, and display options in a Python program.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: GITMAN_CACHE, GITMAN_CACHE_DISABLE, CI, RECORDING_DELAY",
  "targets": "os.getenv calls, logging configuration variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to set cache path and disable flag, logging levels, and display options",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; use of environment variables for configuration is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads environment variables to set configuration parameters such as cache directory, cache disable flag, CI environment detection, and recording delay. It sets logging formats and levels with no apparent dynamic execution or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of standard libraries (logging, os) and conventional patterns suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses environment variables safely for configuration and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
