  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment variable usage is standard and safe. The malware score is correctly 0. The obfuscated score is correctly 0. The security risk score in most reports is appropriate at 0; the slight elevation to 0.2 in one report is likely overstated given the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe and the assessments are accurate."
