  "purpose": "Utilities to call Git commands.",
  "sources": "Inputs from function parameters such as repo URLs, revision identifiers, directory paths, and user parameters.",
  "sinks": "Execution of git commands via subprocess, filesystem operations for configs and directories.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct command arguments and file paths, which are then executed or written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of standard git syntax and subprocess calls appears safe.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard Git repository management functions, executing commands via a wrapper. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The handling of revisions, sparse checkouts, and references aligns with typical practices. No signs of command injection or suspicious file operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing Git repositories with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low security risk scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
