  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow from untrusted sources; no potential for data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions such as ValueError and RuntimeError. The ShellError class captures additional context (program and output) when an error occurs during shell execution. There are no dynamic code executions, input reading, or external interactions present. The code is standard exception class definitions, and nothing appears suspicious or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes used for error handling and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
