  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n- The `ShellError` class's `__init__` method captures additional context (`program`, `output`) but does not process or transmit data maliciously.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, network calls, or obfuscation are present.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code is syntactically correct, with no evident flaws or security issues.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware score: consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n  - Risk score: consistently 0, also appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for defining exceptions and contains no malicious logic.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions; the analysis is sound.\n- The inclusion of `program` and `output` in `ShellError` is standard for capturing context, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a straightforward exception handling module within a larger application.",
