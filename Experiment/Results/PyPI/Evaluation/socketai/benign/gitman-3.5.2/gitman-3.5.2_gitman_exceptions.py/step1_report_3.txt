  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "N/A (no external input or data reading occurs in this code).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data sinks or output operations involving untrusted data).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Use of `super().__init__` with passing args is standard; no suspicious code constructs or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in exception types. The `ShellError` class has an `__init__` method that accepts optional parameters `program` and `output`, but they are only stored as attributes and not used in any malicious context. No external input handling, no network calls, no code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as error class definitions for use elsewhere in the application.",
