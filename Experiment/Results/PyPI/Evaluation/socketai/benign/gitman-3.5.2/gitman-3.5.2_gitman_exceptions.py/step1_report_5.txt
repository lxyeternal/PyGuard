{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application, primarily related to configuration, shell commands, and repository management.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely defines exception classes without input reading or data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; this code only declares classes and a constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; standard exception class definitions with a straightforward constructor.",
  "analysis": "The code creates several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions (ValueError, RuntimeError). The ShellError class includes an __init__ method that captures 'program' and 'output' from keyword arguments, which could be used for debugging or logging. The ScriptFailure class extends ShellError but adds no additional behavior. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, conventional, and free of obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be standard and safe.",
