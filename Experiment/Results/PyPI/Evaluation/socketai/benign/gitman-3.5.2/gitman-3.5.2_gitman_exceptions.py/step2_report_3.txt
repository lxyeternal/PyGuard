  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes: `InvalidConfig`, `ShellError`, `InvalidRepository`, `UncommittedChanges`, and `ScriptFailure`.\n   - `ShellError` captures additional context (`program`, `output`) in its constructor, which is standard for error classes that need extra info.\n   - All classes inherit from built-in exceptions, and there are no dynamic code executions, external calls, or data processing.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, network calls, or obfuscation.\n   - The exception classes are static, straightforward, and serve error handling purposes.\n   - The extra attributes in `ShellError` are stored but not used maliciously.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 in all reports. This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n   - **Risk score**: 0 or very close to it, which is reasonable since these are just exception definitions with no security implications.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Mistakes**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The use of `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` is standard and appropriate.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Consistency**:\n   - The scores given (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions, the risk is minimal.\n   - The extra context stored in `ShellError` could be useful for debugging but doesn't introduce security risks.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe provided reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or revision of scores is necessary.",
