{
  "purpose": "Define shared exception classes for error handling within a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to output; code primarily defines custom exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, primarily for indicating specific error conditions related to configuration, shell commands, repositories, and script execution. The ShellError class includes an __init__ method that captures additional context such as program name and output, but this is standard practice for exception classes. There are no dynamic code executions, external calls, or embedded malicious logic. Overall, the code appears to serve as a clean, well-structured exception handling module without any signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to improve error handling clarity within a larger codebase.",
