  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception classes do not read external data.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or external communication; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exceptions are only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exception classes. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The init method in ShellError captures optional program output but does not process or transmit it maliciously. Overall, the code is straightforward, standard exception class definitions with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
