{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, including capturing additional context in ShellError.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and attribute assignments; no external data input or code execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external system interaction; attributes stored but not transmitted or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with optional context attributes; no data flow leading to external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. ShellError captures extra context attributes but does not process or transmit them maliciously. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is syntactically correct, and the design is standard for error handling modules. No signs of malicious behavior, security flaws, or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
