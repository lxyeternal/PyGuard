  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely defining custom exception classes.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exceptions (`ValueError`, `RuntimeError`) and do not perform any dynamic code execution, external calls, or data handling.\n   - The `ShellError` class captures additional context (`program`, `output`) but only stores them as attributes; no malicious logic is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or embedded malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is straightforward and follows standard Python exception class patterns.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The constructor in `ShellError` correctly captures optional context without side effects.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, but since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n   \n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent, instead focusing on the benign nature of class definitions.\n   \n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus of the reports.",
