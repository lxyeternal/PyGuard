  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'gitman' package or set as '(local)' if not installed; import command functions for package management.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version, importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError, local .commands module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "version() call from importlib.metadata to setting __version__, no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version detection and command import with cleanup",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and exception class, attempts to get package version, handles missing package, and cleans namespace. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are present. The deletion of imported identifiers is standard cleanup. The logic is simple and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard package version detection and command imports. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's behavior.",
