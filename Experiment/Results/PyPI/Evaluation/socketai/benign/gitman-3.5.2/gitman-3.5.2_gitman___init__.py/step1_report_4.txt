{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the version of the 'gitman' package and imports command functions for package management operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via 'importlib.metadata.version' and imports command functions from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves package version data, then assigns it to '__version__'. No further data flow to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed. The import and version retrieval are standard for package metadata handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'PackageNotFoundError' and 'version' from 'importlib.metadata', then attempts to get the version of 'gitman'. If not found, sets '__version__' to '(local)'. It then deletes the imported error class and version function to clean up namespace. All actions are standard for package version management with no suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical package version initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs straightforward metadata retrieval and cleanup.",
