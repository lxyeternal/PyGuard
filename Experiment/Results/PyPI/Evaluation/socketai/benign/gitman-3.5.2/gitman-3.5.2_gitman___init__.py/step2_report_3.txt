  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code. The code is straightforward: it imports version info, attempts to retrieve the package version, handles exceptions if the package isn't installed, and then deletes the imported identifiers. It also imports command functions for package management.\n\n**Confirmed facts:**\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No network communication, data leaks, or external data processing occurs.\n- The logic is standard for package version detection and command importation.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The deletion of imported identifiers is a common cleanup practice.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \nAll conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent, with a confidence level of 1. They correctly identify that the code performs straightforward version retrieval and command imports, with no anomalies or security risks.\n\n**Notable points:**\n- Report 3 assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1, citing the possibility of minor concerns, but the code's simplicity makes this unwarranted.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and scoring considerations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close, which is appropriate. Slightly higher scores (like 0.1) in report 3 are not justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The risk scores should remain at 0, as there's no indication of security issues.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n- The confidence scores are appropriately high (1), given the clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard package version detection and command import module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the majority of the reports. The code is benign, and the scores should reflect that. The current scores are appropriate, with the exception of the minor securityRisk score in report 3, which should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's straightforward, safe nature.",
