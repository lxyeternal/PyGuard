{
  "purpose": "The code initializes the version information of the package 'gitman' and imports command functions for package management operations.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version and PackageNotFoundError, module imports from .commands",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present",
  "flows": "Imports fetch functions and error classes; version retrieval flows from importlib.metadata.version to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import and version handling logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and attempts to retrieve the package version. It handles the exception if the package is not installed locally. No suspicious or malicious code behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The use of importlib.metadata is standard for version info, and the deletion of imported names is a common cleanup practice. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version and command setup for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign with respect to supply chain attacks.",
