{
  "purpose": "The code is used to retrieve the version of the 'gitman' package and import several command functions for package management tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata and imports functions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: attempt to get the package version and assign it to __version__, then delete imported functions and exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The deletion of imported objects is benign and common for namespace cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to obtain the version of the 'gitman' package, handling the case where the package is not found. It then cleans up namespace by deleting imported modules and exception classes. All operations are standard for version retrieval and namespace management. No untrusted data sources or harmful actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package version check with namespace cleanup and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
