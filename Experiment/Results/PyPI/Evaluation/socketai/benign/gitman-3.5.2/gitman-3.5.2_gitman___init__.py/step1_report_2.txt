{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for the 'gitman' package and imports command functions for package management operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from importlib.metadata and relative imports from commands module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from input to critical functions or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The dynamic retrieval of package version is standard. No obfuscation or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information handling utilities and command functions, then attempts to retrieve the package version for 'gitman'. If the package isn't installed, it assigns '(local)'. It then deletes imported identifiers to clean namespace. The logic is straightforward and typical for Python package modules. No suspicious or malicious code is detected, and no external communication or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve a standard purpose of managing package metadata and command imports with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
