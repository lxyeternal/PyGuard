  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a standard CLI for dependency management, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, importing only standard and internal modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious activities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the lack of suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is solid. The code appears to be a typical CLI wrapper with no evident security issues. The confidence is high, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the fact that the code mainly dispatches commands based on user input, with no malicious activities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. The code’s structure and operations are benign, and the low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlights the lack of suspicious code, with the caveat that actual command implementations are external.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is appropriate. The code itself is safe; potential risks depend on the imported command functions, which are outside this snippet. The score reflects that.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a standard CLI dispatcher, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's content. The slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) could be due to the mention that imported modules might perform unsafe operations, but since the code itself does not do so, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is a typical CLI dispatcher without any malicious payloads or suspicious activities.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports. Given that the code only dispatches commands and relies on external modules for actual operations, the low scores are justified. The slight increase in some reports accounts for potential risks in the command implementations, but these are outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (considering the code itself is benign, and risks depend on external modules)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured CLI interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is minimal, primarily depending on the implementations of the command functions, which are not shown here. Based on the provided information, I agree with the scores and reasoning of the reports.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
