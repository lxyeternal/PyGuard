  "purpose": "Command-line interface for managing dependencies using Git.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse; imports modules like log, commands, common, exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Calls functions from commands module based on user input; logs debug info; prints help messages.",
  "flows": "User input parsed via argparse → _get_command determines function and parameters → _run_command executes the function → handles exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Uses standard argument parsing and command dispatch.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a CLI for dependency management with multiple subcommands (init, install, update, list, lock, uninstall, show, edit). It imports local modules and uses standard logging and argument parsing. No signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The code handles exceptions related to version control and configuration but does not perform any unsafe operations like executing untrusted code or network communication outside its command functions. The code appears well-structured, using typical patterns for CLI applications, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI interface for dependency management; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
