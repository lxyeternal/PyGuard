  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard CLI wrapper for dependency management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, typical for CLI tools)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious indicators. The low security risk score is justified given the code's nature. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a typical CLI for dependency management, with no malicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a CLI for dependency management, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. The code is standard, and the low risk score reflects that. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI wrapper that dispatches commands to internal modules, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is appropriate. The code appears benign, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a CLI for dependency management, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. The code is straightforward, and the risk score is low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the typical risk level of CLI wrapper scripts that invoke internal commands.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard CLI interface, parsing arguments and dispatching commands.\n- No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with a typical CLI tool, no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code appears safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and a very low security risk.",
