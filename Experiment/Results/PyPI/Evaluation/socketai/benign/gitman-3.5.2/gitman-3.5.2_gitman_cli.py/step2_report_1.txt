  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard CLI for dependency management.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; imports are standard, no external network or file manipulations evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical CLI pattern.\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The securityRisk is minimal, considering no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for dependencies, similar to above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Very safe, standard pattern.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for dependency management.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical CLI wrapper.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for dependency management.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard CLI.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for dependency management.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; no obfuscation or external suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) compared to others, possibly reflecting a conservative stance considering the command dispatching to external modules. However, based solely on this code, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are 0, which is appropriate given the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code is a standard CLI dispatcher, these are reasonable, with 0.2 being a cautious estimate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical CLI interface that delegates to internal command functions.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident.\n- The minor securityRisk scores (0.1 or 0.2) are justified as conservative estimates, acknowledging that the actual security depends on the implementations of the command functions, which are outside this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, reflecting the inherent risk of executing external command functions, but no specific issues in this code.\n\n**Note:** The actual security of the system depends on the implementations of the command functions invoked, but based on this script alone, it appears safe.",
