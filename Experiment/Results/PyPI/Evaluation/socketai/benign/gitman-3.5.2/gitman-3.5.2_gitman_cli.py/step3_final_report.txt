  "purpose": "Command-line interface for dependency management using Git.",
  "sources": "User input arguments parsed via argparse, command functions invoked based on subcommands.",
  "sinks": "Dispatching to command functions; no external data sinks or network activity evident in this code.",
  "flows": "User input -> argument parsing -> command selection -> command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No external network or file manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI dispatcher that parses arguments and delegates to internal command functions. It imports only standard modules and internal modules, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The command functions are external and not provided, so potential risks depend on their implementation, but the dispatcher itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the typical risk level of such CLI wrappers. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured CLI interface for dependency management, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security flaws. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's benign nature. Overall, it appears safe and suitable for use.",
