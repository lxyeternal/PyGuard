  "purpose": "This script implements a command-line interface for managing project dependencies using Git, supporting commands like init, install, update, list, lock, uninstall, show, and edit.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via command-line arguments. Imports modules such as argparse, sys, log, and internal commands and common modules. Reads version info from __version__.",
  "sinks": "Invokes functions from the commands module based on user input, passing arguments and keyword arguments. Calls logging functions and output functions such as common.show. Uses sys.exit for termination.",
  "flows": "User inputs parsed by argparse -> _get_command determines function to invoke -> _run_command executes selected function with arguments -> potential error handling and output display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secret keys, or sensitive data present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected. No suspicious network activity or file operations shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface with argument parsing, command dispatching, and error handling. All imported modules are standard or internal, with no external network communication, file manipulation, or cryptographic operations. The commands invoked are from an internal commands module, but their implementations are not provided here. The structure appears typical for CLI tools, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage. The code handles user inputs safely via argparse, and all operations are based on explicit user commands. No hidden behaviors or suspicious activities are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a conventional CLI wrapper for dependency management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks in this form. No anomalies, malware indicators, or obfuscated code are present. It appears safe and aligned with typical CLI design patterns.",
