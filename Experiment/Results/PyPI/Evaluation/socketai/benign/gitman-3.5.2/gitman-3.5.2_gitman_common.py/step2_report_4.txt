  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, primarily utility functions for CLI, logging, and styling.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The code uses standard libraries and conventions.\n- The only unusual element is the use of `time.sleep(settings.RECORDING_DELAY)` in `show()`, which is likely intended for pacing or recording purposes, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nBenign CLI utility code with no malicious signals. The report's confidence is high (0.95), and malware is scored as 0.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, justified by standard output/input handling.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nAgain, benign CLI utility code. Confidence is 1, malware 0.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — justified, as no security concern.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores align well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nBenign, with a note on potential leaks if misused, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — low, consistent with benign utility code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nSame conclusion, no malicious activity, standard utility code.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nBenign CLI utility, with a note on `time.sleep()` being unusual but not malicious.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is correct.\n- Obfuscation is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- The risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), justified by the nature of the code.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \n- Given the thorough analysis, I agree with the current scores. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, standard utility code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign CLI utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
