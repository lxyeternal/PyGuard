{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for command-line argument parsing, logging configuration, and output styling, mainly for use in command-line tools.",
  "sources": "Input is read from user prompts via the 'prompt' function and messages supplied to 'show' and 'prompt'. Data is read from environment variables (e.g., 'os.environ') for color support detection.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'print' statements for output and 'log.error'/'log.info' for logging messages, which could leak sensitive info if misused. 'input' function reads user input, which could be exploited if used insecurely.",
  "flows": "User input flows from 'prompt' to the calling code; messages flow through 'show' to stdout; log messages flow through 'log' functions to logging handlers; environment variable checks influence styling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Use of color styling functions appears benign. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident. The code uses standard modules and conventions without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines utility classes and functions for argument parsing, logging, and styled output, with safe practices in handling user input and output. Logging levels are configurable; styling adapts to terminal capabilities. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious code flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for command-line interfaces, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It uses standard Python libraries and safe coding practices. The overall security risk is minimal.",
