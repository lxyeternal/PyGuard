  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for command-line interface formatting, logging configuration, and output styling, primarily for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": [
    "argparse for command-line argument parsing",
    "logging module for logging setup",
    "os.environ for environment variable checks",
    "sys.stdout and sys.platform for output and platform checks",
    "input() function for prompting user input"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "print() statements for output display",
    "log.error() and log.info() calls for logging messages",
    "input() for user input"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "User calls show() which writes messages to stdout or logs based on verbosity",
    "prompt() uses input() to read user input",
    "style() modifies message appearance based on terminal support and style name"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of time.sleep() in show() with settings.RECORDING_DELAY introduces artificial delay, which is unusual but not malicious",
    "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are present",
    "All functions perform standard logging, formatting, or output operations without hidden behaviors",
    "No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration routines detected"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code predominantly manages CLI formatting, logging, and output styling, utilizing standard Python libraries and conventional practices. The presence of functions like show() and prompt() handle user interaction and output display, with no signs of malicious activity. There are no external network connections, data leaks, or hidden functionalities. The use of time.sleep() appears to be for deliberate delays, possibly for user experience. The code relies on external modules like log and settings, which are not provided here but appear to be configuration or utility modules. Overall, the code maintains standard patterns for CLI utilities without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs benign CLI utilities including logging, styling, and user prompts. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use within a CLI-based application.",
