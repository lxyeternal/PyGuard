  "purpose": "Utility module for CLI formatting, logging, styling, and user interaction.",
  "sources": "Input from user prompts, environment variables, and logging functions.",
  "sinks": "Console output, logging handlers, and style formatting; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input functions feed into display/output functions; styling functions modify messages before display.",
  "anomalies": "Use of time.sleep() in show() for delays; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for command-line interfaces, logging, and styling. It employs standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The use of sleep is likely for pacing or recording delays, not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current security risk and malware scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
