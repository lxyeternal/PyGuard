{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for command-line interface, logging configuration, and output styling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (argparse, logging, os, sys, time, log, settings). Reads user input via input(). Accesses environment variables (os.environ).",
  "sinks": "Potentially logs messages using log functions. Uses input() for user prompts. Outputs to stdout.",
  "flows": "User input from prompt() could influence program flow. Logging functions could record user interactions. show() displays messages and logs them.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No malicious domain connections or data exfiltration observed. The code appears to be standard utility code without obfuscated patterns or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical utility module for CLI applications. It configures logging levels, formats, and output styles. It manages indentation, output, and user prompts. Uses environment checks for ANSI support and standard libraries for logging and output formatting. No parts of the code perform network operations, data exfiltration, or contain suspicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors. The code operates within expected bounds of a CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module focused on CLI interactions, logging, and output formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be safe for use.",
