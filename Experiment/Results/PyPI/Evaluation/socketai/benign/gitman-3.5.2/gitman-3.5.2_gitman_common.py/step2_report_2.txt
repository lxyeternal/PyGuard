  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a utility module for CLI formatting, logging, and styling.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n- Uses standard libraries and straightforward functions.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- The only unusual aspect is the use of `time.sleep()` in `show()` with `settings.RECORDING_DELAY`, which appears intended for controlled delays, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign CLI utility module, no malicious signals.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — very low, justified by minimal risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected. The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar benign utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, and the low risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, safe handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard CLI utility, no malicious signals.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Similar benign utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate. The only noteworthy point is the `time.sleep()` delay, which is not malicious but perhaps unusual; however, it's justified as part of user experience.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not contain any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly justified as 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor, mostly due to use of `time.sleep()` for delays, which is benign but somewhat unusual in utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed. The code is a standard CLI utility module with no security concerns.",
