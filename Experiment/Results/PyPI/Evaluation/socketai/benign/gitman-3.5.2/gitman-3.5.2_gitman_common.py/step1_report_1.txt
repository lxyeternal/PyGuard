{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for command-line interface configuration, logging, and output styling.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (argparse, logging, os, sys, time), custom modules (log, settings), and class/function definitions that process input parameters, configuration, and output.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'print' and 'log' functions for output; user input collected via 'input()' in 'prompt()'; access to environment variables via 'os.environ' for color support detection.",
  "flows": "User input flows from 'input()' in 'prompt()'; output flows through 'print()' and 'log' functions; configuration settings influence logging levels and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution that could be malicious; no network activity or data exfiltration routines present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on CLI configuration, logging, and output styling. It adjusts logging levels, formats messages, and manages indentation for output. It reads environment variables to determine color support but does not process untrusted input beyond standard input prompts. No network activity, file modifications, or data leaks are present. The functions and classes perform expected roles without hidden behaviors. All operations are typical for CLI utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for CLI and logging management. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The security risk is minimal, primarily involving standard input/output handling. No malicious signals or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
