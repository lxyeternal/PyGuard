{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions and classes for command-line argument parsing, logging configuration, output formatting, and styling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "User inputs via the prompt() function; configuration values from the settings module; environment variables for color support; external logging library 'log'.",
  "sinks": "User inputs from prompt(); log messages sent via log.info(), log.error().",
  "flows": "User input captured in prompt() → used in the flow of the application; log messages flow from show() to log functions; styling functions process messages before output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code contains standard formatting and logging practices. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Usage of time.sleep() for delays could be misused, but appears intended for recording delay.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles command-line argument formatting, logging setup, message display with indentation, and text styling. It imports standard modules and a 'log' module, which is presumed to be an internal logging utility. The functions are straightforward and do not include any network activity, system manipulation, or data exfiltration. The style() function adjusts message color output based on environment support. No external inputs are used to influence critical behavior, and no data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a utility module for CLI formatting, logging, and styling, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as designed for standard application output and logging purposes.",
