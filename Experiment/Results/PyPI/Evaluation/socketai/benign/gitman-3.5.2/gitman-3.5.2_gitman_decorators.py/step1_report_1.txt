  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to preserve the current working directory during the execution of a wrapped function.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() to read the current working directory",
  "sinks": "os.chdir(cwd) to change the current working directory",
  "flows": "os.getcwd() -> function execution -> os.chdir(cwd)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard usage of os module and decorator pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and 'wraps' from functools, then defines a decorator 'preserve_cwd' that saves the current working directory before executing a given function and restores it afterward. This pattern is common for context preservation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended for ensuring directory context consistency during function calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe operation to maintain working directory state during function execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard.",
