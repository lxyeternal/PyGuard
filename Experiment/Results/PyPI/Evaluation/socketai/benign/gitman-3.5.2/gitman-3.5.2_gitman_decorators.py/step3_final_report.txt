  "purpose": "A decorator to preserve and restore the current working directory during function execution.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() to read the current directory before function call.",
  "sinks": "os.chdir(cwd) to restore the directory after function execution.",
  "flows": "Source (os.getcwd()) -> Function execution -> Sink (os.chdir(cwd)).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that captures the current working directory using os.getcwd(), executes the wrapped function, and then restores the directory with os.chdir(). All reports confirm the code's correctness, simplicity, and lack of suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious code are present. The code is a common utility pattern with no obfuscation or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility decorator with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and justified.",
