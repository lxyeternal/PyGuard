{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to preserve the current working directory during the execution of a wrapped function.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() to read the current working directory.",
  "sinks": "os.chdir(cwd) to restore the working directory after function execution.",
  "flows": "The decorator captures the current directory (source), executes the function, then resets the directory to the original (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python library functions to preserve the working directory around a function call, ensuring no change persists. It is a typical pattern for context management. No data leaks, obfuscated code, or malicious activities are present. The code structure and formatting are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a safe and common utility decorator to preserve the current working directory. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are identified.",
