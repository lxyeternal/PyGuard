  "purpose": "A decorator function to preserve the current working directory during the execution of another function.",
  "sources": "Reads the current working directory with os.getcwd() before calling the wrapped function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external effect; uses os.chdir() to restore directory.",
  "flows": "os.getcwd() (source) -> wrapped function execution -> os.chdir() (sink) to restore directory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that captures the current working directory before executing a function and restores it afterward. No data leaks, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads are present. The use of os.getcwd() and os.chdir() is standard and safe within the context of preserving execution environment. No suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a straightforward utility purpose without any malicious behavior or security risks. It maintains the working directory state reliably.",
