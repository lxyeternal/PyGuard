{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to preserve the current working directory during the execution of a function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory using os.getcwd() when the decorated function is invoked.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects sensitive operations or causes security issues.",
  "flows": "The flow involves saving the current directory before function execution and restoring it afterward; no untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that temporarily changes the working directory during a function call and then restores it, which is a common pattern for maintaining context. There is no use of untrusted input, no network operations, and no suspicious code behaviors. The code's simplicity and lack of external inputs or outputs indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility decorator intended to preserve the current working directory during function execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues are detected.",
