{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to preserve the current working directory during the execution of a function.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() to read the current working directory, function arguments to invoke the wrapped function",
  "sinks": "os.chdir(cwd) to restore the working directory",
  "flows": "Reading the current directory, executing the wrapped function, then changing back to the original directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed; the code simply manages directory state",
  "analysis": "The code uses a decorator pattern to save the current working directory before executing a function and restores it afterward. It employs standard library functions without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network or file operations that could be malicious, and no indication of data leaks or unauthorized actions. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of directory context management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function designed to maintain directory state around function execution. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
