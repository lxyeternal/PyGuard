  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a decorator that saves the current working directory before executing a function and restores it afterward.\n- The code uses standard Python functions (`os.getcwd()` and `os.chdir()`) and common patterns.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious activities are detected across all reports.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly preserves the working directory, and the logic is sound.\n- **Malware potential:** None of the reports indicate any malicious behavior. The code doesn't perform network operations, handle untrusted input, or execute any suspicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree that the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk:** Since the code only manages directory context without external inputs or outputs, the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1.0\n\nThese are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent.\n- The code pattern is a common utility function, not a security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
