The overall security risk is low (score 0.2), justified by the potential but unsubstantiated risk from external script execution functions. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure."

The malware score is correctly 0. The obfuscated score is correctly 0. The security risk score in most reports is appropriate at 0; the slight elevation to 0.2 in one report is likely overstated given the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe and the assessments are accurate."
