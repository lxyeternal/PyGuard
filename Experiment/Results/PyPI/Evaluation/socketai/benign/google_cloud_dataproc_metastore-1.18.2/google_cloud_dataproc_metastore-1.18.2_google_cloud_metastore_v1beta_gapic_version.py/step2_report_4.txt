  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code provided is a standard header comment block with licensing information and a single `__version__` variable assignment. All reports agree that there are no executable statements, data flows, or input/output operations. No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is purely metadata, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and there's no evidence of malicious activity, there's no justification for higher scores. The code is clearly safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions. They are cautious and accurate, considering only the provided static code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and contains no security issues.**  \nThe reports are thorough and accurate, reflecting the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard license and version header with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No changes needed.",
