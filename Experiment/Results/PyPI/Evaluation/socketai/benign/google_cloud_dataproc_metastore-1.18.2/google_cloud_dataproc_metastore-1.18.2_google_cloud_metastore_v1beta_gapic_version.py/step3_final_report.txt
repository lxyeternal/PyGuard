  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata, including licensing comments and a version variable, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments and assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code contains only static metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version assignment, with no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. It is a standard boilerplate header for an open-source Python package. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static metadata with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
