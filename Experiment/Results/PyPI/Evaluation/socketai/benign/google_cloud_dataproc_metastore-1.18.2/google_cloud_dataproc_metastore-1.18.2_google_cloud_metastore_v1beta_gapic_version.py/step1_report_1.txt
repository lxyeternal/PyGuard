  "anomalies": "Presence of licensing comments is normal; no suspicious activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments related to licensing and a single variable assignment (__version__). No input sources, data flows, or execution paths that could lead to security issues. The __version__ variable is a common practice for versioning, not malicious. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing metadata about the package. No malware or security risks identified.",
