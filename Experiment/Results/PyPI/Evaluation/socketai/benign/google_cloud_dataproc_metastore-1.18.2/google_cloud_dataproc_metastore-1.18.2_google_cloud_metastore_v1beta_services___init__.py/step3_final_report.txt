  "purpose": "This code fragment contains only licensing comments and copyright notices, serving as boilerplate licensing information with no executable code or data flows.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only comments present, no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code consists solely of comments without any data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; absence of executable code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely licensing comments with no executable or data processing elements. No sources, sinks, or flows are present. The code does not contain any anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The analysis confirms that the fragment is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence is high (1) due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is entirely benign, consisting solely of licensing comments with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are accurate and justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
