  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard client library for Google Cloud Metastore Federation, resource helpers, environment variables, credential handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests via transport, error handling appends credential info to error details, which could leak sensitive info if errors are exposed externally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or code injection. Credential info appended to errors is typical for debugging but could be a concern if error details are leaked. No signs of malware.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, no malware, but caution with error info leakage. Confidence: 0.9. Obfuscated: 0. Malware: 0. Security risk: low (~0.2).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue:** Empty response, no further details.\n- **Analysis:** No code review possible; no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard resource path helpers, environment variable reads, credential handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network API calls, error handling appends credential info, standard in SDKs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Use of environment variables and standard Google SDK patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard client SDK, no signs of malware. Confidence: 0.95. Obfuscated: 0. Malware: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK pattern, resource management, environment configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls, metadata headers, credential handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, no malware signs. Confidence: 0.95. Obfuscated: 0. Malware: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, resource helpers, environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests, no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard SDK.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard client library, no malware or sabotage. Confidence: 0.95. Obfuscated: 0. Malware: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports describe standard, auto-generated Google Cloud SDK client code.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- Credential info is only appended to error details for debugging, which is common but should be managed carefully.\n- No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation detected.\n- Environment variables are used appropriately for configuration, not malicious purposes.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for credential info leakage in error details, but overall low risk, I would set it around **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a legitimate, standard Google Cloud SDK client library for managing Metastore Federation resources. It follows best practices, uses environment variables for configuration, and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor concern is the appending of credential info to error details, which should be carefully managed in production environments to prevent accidental leakage.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or specific focus on any part.",
