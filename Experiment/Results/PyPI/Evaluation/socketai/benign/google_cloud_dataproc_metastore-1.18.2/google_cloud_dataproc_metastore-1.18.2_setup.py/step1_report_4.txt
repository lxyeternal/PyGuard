{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifically for the Google Cloud Dataproc Metastore API client library. It manages package metadata, dependencies, and distribution settings.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a local file ('gapic_version.py'), reads README.rst for long description, and reads dependencies from static lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or data leak points. No code executes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static files (version file and README) into package metadata; no external untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures. It reads version info from a local file with regex, loads README content, and specifies dependencies and package discovery. No external data inputs are processed at runtime beyond reading static files. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code adheres to typical Python packaging standards and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply automates package metadata and dependency management.",
