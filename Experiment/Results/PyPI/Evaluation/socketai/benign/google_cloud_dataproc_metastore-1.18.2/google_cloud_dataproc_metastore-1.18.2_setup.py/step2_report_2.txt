  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe a standard Python package setup script (`setup.py`) for the `google-cloud-dataproc-metastore` package.\n- The code reads version info from an internal file, reads README content, discovers packages, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static dependencies and metadata.\n- No suspicious code, external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code appears to be a typical setup script.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Data flows:** Static, from local files and hardcoded dependencies.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None apparent; assertions and regex are straightforward.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- The regex for version extraction is simple and safe.\n- No external inputs or dynamic code execution.\n- The dependencies are fixed version constraints, not influenced by user input.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious intent or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven all evidence, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
