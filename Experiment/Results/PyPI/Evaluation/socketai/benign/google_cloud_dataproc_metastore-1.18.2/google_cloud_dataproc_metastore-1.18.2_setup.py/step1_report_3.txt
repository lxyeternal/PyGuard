  "purpose": "Setup script for the google-cloud-dataproc-metastore Python package, managing dependencies, versioning, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from a local file, reading README content, importing standard libraries, and setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external system modifications present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; no dynamic code execution or data manipulation that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. All operations are standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information from a local file using regex, loads a README file, determines packages using setuptools, and calls setuptools.setup() with static and computed parameters. The dependencies are fixed version constraints. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code adheres to typical package setup conventions and contains no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs package metadata and dependency management tasks as expected.",
