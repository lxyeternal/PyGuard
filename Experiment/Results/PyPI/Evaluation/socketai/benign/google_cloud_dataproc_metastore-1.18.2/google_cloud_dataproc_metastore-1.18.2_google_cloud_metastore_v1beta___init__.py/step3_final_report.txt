{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module setup for the Google Cloud Metastore SDK, importing version info, client classes, and data types for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from various modules and type definitions; no runtime data input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static import/export structure.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; standard SDK boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization file, importing classes and types, and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for SDK packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK setup module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
