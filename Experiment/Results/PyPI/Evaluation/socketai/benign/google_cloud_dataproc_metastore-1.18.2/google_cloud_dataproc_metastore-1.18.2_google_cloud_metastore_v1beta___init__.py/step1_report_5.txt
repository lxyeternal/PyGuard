{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, imports specific classes and functions from the google.cloud.metastore_v1beta package, and specifies public API exports for a client library related to Google Cloud's Dataproc Metastore services.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.metastore_v1beta and local module definitions",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or outputs observed",
  "flows": "N/A - static import and export definitions, no data flow or processing logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present. All imports and definitions are standard for SDK package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily module setup: licensing info, version import, class/function imports, and export list. It adheres to typical Python package structure for Google Cloud SDKs. No code executes at runtime, no input/output handling, no suspicious or malicious instructions, no network or data exfiltration logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign SDK module setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as an interface layer exposing client classes and request/response types for the Google Cloud Metastore API.",
