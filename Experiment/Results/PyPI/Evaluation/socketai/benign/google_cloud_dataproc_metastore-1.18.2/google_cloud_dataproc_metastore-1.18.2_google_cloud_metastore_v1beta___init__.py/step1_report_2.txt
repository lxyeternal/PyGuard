{
  "purpose": "This code defines module imports and exports for Google Cloud Metastore client libraries and associated data types, facilitating interaction with Google Cloud services.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'google.cloud.metastore_v1beta' and relative module imports from local package structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code primarily sets up class and data type definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is mainly import/export declarations without runtime data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated patterns are present. The licensing and import structure is standard for SDK modules.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and a list of exported symbols, which are typical for a Python SDK module. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or insecure handling of environment variables. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard SDK design practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python SDK module setup for Google Cloud Metastore services. It contains no malicious code, no malware indicators, and no security risks. It solely provides interface definitions for other code to utilize.",
