{
  "purpose": "The code defines and registers different transport classes for Google Cloud Dataproc Metastore Federation, enabling communication via gRPC, gRPC asyncio, and REST.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, and accesses the _transport_registry dictionary to assign transport types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily sets up transport class mappings.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code initializes static mappings and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard class and registry setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and classes, creates an ordered dictionary for transport registration, and populates it with transport class references. The structure appears standard for a Python package that supports multiple transport methods. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network communication, data collection, or sensitive operations. All operations are static and conform to common Python packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for transport class registration in a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
