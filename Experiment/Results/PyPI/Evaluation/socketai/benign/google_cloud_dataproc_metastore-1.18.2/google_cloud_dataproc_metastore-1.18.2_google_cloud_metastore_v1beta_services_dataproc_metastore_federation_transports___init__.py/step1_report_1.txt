  "purpose": "Defines and registers transport classes for DataprocMetastoreFederation, supporting multiple communication protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, local modules, and initialization of a transport registry.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data handling or output to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Registry creation and population -> Export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be a standard module setup for transport class registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and local modules to define transport classes. It initializes an ordered dictionary for transport registry, populates it with specific transport classes, and sets the __all__ variable for module exports. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no input/output handling, and no hardcoded secrets. The import statements and registry setup are typical for modular Python projects. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup for registering transport classes in a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on this analysis.",
