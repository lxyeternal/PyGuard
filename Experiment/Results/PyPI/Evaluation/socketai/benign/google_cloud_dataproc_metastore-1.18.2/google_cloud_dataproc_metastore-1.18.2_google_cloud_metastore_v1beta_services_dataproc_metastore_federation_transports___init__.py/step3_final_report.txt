  "purpose": "Register different transport classes for the DataprocMetastoreFederation client SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and local classes; creation of an ordered registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks; static registration only.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the registry with class references; no dynamic data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static setup with no secrets, dynamic code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, creates an ordered dictionary to register transport classes, and exposes these via __all__. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, and no obfuscation. It is a typical setup module for SDK transport registration, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK setup code for registering transport classes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
