  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module as a source of truth.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.0' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "The assignment of version string is straightforward and does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is simple and static. The comment line does not affect execution.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string and includes a copyright comment. It does not perform any input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The version is hardcoded, which is typical for package versioning. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for Python packages.",
