  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control.",
  "sources": "No external input; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string (__version__ = \"1.37.0\") with a comment. It contains no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external dependencies. The code is standard for Python package versioning. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence (1). The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
