  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply assigns a static version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`) with an accompanying comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data flows, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and typical for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The comments and code do not suggest any hidden or malicious intent.\n   - The copyright year (2025) is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious—likely a typo or future planning.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty based on the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year, but this does not impact security.\n   - No assumptions about malicious activity are justified here.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score**: Should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score**: Should remain **0**.\n- **Risk score**: Should remain **0**, as there's no security concern.\n\n### Personal Estimation:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, standard version declaration, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The current scoring is appropriate.",
