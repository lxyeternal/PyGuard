  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward version assignment with an unrelated copyright comment.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version variable with a static string and includes a copyright comment. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing occurs. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The copyright date is 2025, which is in the future, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard version declaration with a copyright comment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
