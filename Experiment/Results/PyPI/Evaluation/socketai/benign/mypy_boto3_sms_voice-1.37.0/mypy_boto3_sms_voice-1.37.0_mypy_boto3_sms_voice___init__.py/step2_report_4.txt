  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a simple module that imports a class from a local module and exposes it via an alias and `__all__`.\n- The docstring provides documentation and usage instructions.\n- No external data inputs, network calls, or data processing are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only anomaly noted is a future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a typo or placeholder.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes a straightforward interface.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; the code is a minimal interface.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar straightforward interface.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomaly:** The future copyright year (2025). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025). While not a security issue, it might be worth noting as a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't affect the security assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and has no malware.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments. No changes needed.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, straightforward interface module with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
