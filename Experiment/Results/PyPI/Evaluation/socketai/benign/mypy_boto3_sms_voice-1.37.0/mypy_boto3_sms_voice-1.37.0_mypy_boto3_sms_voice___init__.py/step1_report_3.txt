{
  "purpose": "Main interface for SMS-voice service, providing access to the PinpointSMSVoiceClient class for interacting with the SMS-voice API.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.client' and the module docstring; no external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code only defines an alias and exports, with no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with a standard module import, alias assignment, and docstring. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple interface module that imports a client class from a local module and exposes it as 'Client'. The docstring provides documentation and usage instructions. No input processing, data handling, or network activity occurs here. The code is clean, well-structured, and contains no signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module primarily serving as an alias for the client class and providing documentation. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risks.",
