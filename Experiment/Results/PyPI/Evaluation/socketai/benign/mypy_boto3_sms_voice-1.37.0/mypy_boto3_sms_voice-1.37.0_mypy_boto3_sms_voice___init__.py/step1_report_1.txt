  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the SMS-voice service by importing and aliasing the client class for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports the PinpointSMSVoiceClient class from a local module (.client).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Imports class from local module -> assigns alias to Client -> exposes via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code is primarily import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module that serves as an interface for the SMS-voice service. It imports a client class from a local module, creates an alias, and sets the module's public API. The included docstring provides usage instructions and documentation links. There are no external data inputs, no code execution from untrusted sources, and no sensitive data handling evident. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard Python module design for SDK interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface wrapper with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears safe and intended solely for client-side API access, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
