  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in sys.argv, then calls print_version() or print_info() which write static data to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded static strings, no dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs predefined static information. It only reads command-line arguments and writes static strings to stdout. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The functions are simple and serve only to display static info. The logic is correct and consistent with its purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is appropriate but could be standardized to 0, given the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify its safety. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0 for accuracy and consistency.",
