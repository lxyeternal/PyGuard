  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs to stdout",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Command-line argument in sys.argv triggers print_version, which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed; no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script functions solely to display static package information and version details based on command-line input. It reads command-line arguments to determine which info to display, then writes static strings to stdout. No external data sources, untrusted input processing, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward and contains no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that provides package info and version details with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
