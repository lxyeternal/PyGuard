{
  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational outputs about boto3 stub typings and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command-line arguments), sys.stdout (for output messages)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (for printing info), no external or untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "Command-line input (argv) triggers print_version, which then outputs version info; otherwise, print_info outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected; the code is straightforward and informational",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool that outputs static package and version information based on user input. It does not process or handle untrusted data beyond command-line arguments, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications. No malicious or suspicious code segments are present. The code structure is clean, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that provides package information. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
