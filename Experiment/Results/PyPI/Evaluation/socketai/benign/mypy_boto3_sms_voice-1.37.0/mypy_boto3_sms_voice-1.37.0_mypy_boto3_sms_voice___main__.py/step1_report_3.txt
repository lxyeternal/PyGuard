  "purpose": "Provide CLI functionality to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, sys.argv for input handling",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) leading to print_version() or print_info() which write to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no unusual code structures. Functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script simply handles CLI commands to display static package information or version. It reads command-line arguments and writes static information to standard output. No data input is processed that could lead to injection or leaks. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. The code is minimal and appears benign. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI script with static outputs and no suspicious or malicious elements. It poses no security risks and contains no malware or obfuscation.",
