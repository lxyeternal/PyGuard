  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that provides package info and version details. It reads command-line arguments to decide whether to print version info or general package info. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no code injections. The code does not include any obfuscated parts, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports. It only outputs static information when invoked with specific parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for informational purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
