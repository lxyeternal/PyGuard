  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-sms-voice package, used to configure package metadata and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; imports setup from setuptools; reads environment variables and package data.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data outputs or network calls.",
  "flows": "Reads package description from file -> passes static data to setup() -> no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package. It reads a local README file for description and passes static metadata to the setuptools setup() function. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, network operations, or code execution mechanisms. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, benign setup script with no indications of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
