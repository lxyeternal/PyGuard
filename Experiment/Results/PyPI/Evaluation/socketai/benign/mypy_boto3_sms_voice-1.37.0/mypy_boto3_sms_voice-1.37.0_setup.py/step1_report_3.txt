{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-sms-voice package, used to configure and install the package with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing setup from setuptools; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file writes, or environment variables are accessed or manipulated.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed; the script only constructs a package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The script appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for reading a local README file, then configures package metadata using setuptools.setup(). There are no input validation, dynamic code execution, or network operations. All data appears static and related solely to package configuration. The code structure is straightforward, typical of a Python package setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for a package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It only reads a README file and defines package metadata for distribution.",
