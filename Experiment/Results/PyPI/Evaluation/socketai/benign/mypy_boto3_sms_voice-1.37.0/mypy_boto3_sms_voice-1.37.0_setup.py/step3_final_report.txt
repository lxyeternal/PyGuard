  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-sms-voice package, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file write operations; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> setup() with static parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports from pathlib and setuptools, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and calls setup() with static, predefined metadata. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The copyright year is 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious. All security signals are benign, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
