{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-sms-voice package to facilitate installation and configuration of the package.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package metadata and dependencies; imports from standard libraries and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external network or file writes based on untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for description, gathers package info, and sets up dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup script. It imports standard libraries, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with static package info, dependencies, and metadata. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no runtime code execution, no network communication, or suspicious behavior. All components are consistent with a legitimate package configuration. The copyright date is 2025, which is in the future but does not influence security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
