  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDict classes, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network calls, or external input handling are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code is well-structured, standard for SDK type annotations, and appears to serve documentation and static type checking purposes.\n- The conditional imports based on Python version are typical for maintaining compatibility across different environments and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any issues with the code. The code is purely static type annotations with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n\n- **Logical flaws:** None detected. The code follows standard practices for type annotations.\n- **Implementation mistakes:** No implementation errors are apparent. The use of `NotRequired` and `TypedDict` is appropriate, and the conditional imports are correctly handled.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n\n- The reports correctly challenge any claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions—they find none.\n- The code does not perform any runtime actions or handle untrusted data, so there's no attack surface.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The detailed analysis supports the conclusion that this is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is purely static type annotations, with no executable or dynamic components. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The extensive use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this code. It is a typical, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK or API client, serving documentation and static type checking purposes.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. No changes needed.",
