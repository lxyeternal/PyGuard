  "purpose": "Define type annotations for SMS-Voice service data structures for documentation and type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines TypedDict classes and type aliases, and assigns __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output functions; the code is purely type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "Type definitions are static and do not involve data flow; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code uses standard Python typing features with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes static type definitions for a Python SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. No runtime logic, data handling, or network operations are present. The use of NotRequired and TypedDict is standard for defining optional fields in data structures. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual constructs are identified. The code adheres to common type annotation patterns for SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely declarative and intended for static type checking.",
