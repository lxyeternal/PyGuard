  "purpose": "Type annotations for sms-voice service type definitions.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, conditional imports based on Python version",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data handling or external data sources",
  "flows": "None; purely static type annotations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of conditional imports for compatibility",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDict class definitions with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code serves as static type annotations for SDK documentation and type safety. The import patterns are standard for cross-version compatibility and do not indicate malicious intent. No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved, and the code does not process or handle external data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
