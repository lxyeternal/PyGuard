{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the sms-voice service API, facilitating type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "The code primarily sources data from type annotations, imported modules, and class attribute definitions. No external input sources such as user input or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities; the code is strictly defining data types without any data processing or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Since the code is only defining data structures, there are no data flows or source-to-sink paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive version-dependent imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation. It does not include executable logic, data processing, network communication, or external data handling. The use of version checks and conditional imports suggests careful design for compatibility but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of backdoors, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The code strictly defines data structures used for API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK or API client. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely for type safety and documentation.",
