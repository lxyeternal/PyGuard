{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for sms-voice service API interactions, primarily used for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, typing, and typing_extensions; type definitions for data structures; no external or untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static type definitions without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on Python version; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code is standard for type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, TypedDict classes, and conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It imports necessary modules safely and defines data types for API request and response structures. No executable code, user input handling, or dynamic data manipulation is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code adheres to standard practices for type hinting in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions for an sms-voice service SDK, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is well-structured, static, and intended solely for type safety and documentation purposes. There is no evidence of malware, security risks, or supply chain attacks within this module.",
