{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for sms-voice service type definitions, primarily for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, builtins, collections.abc, typing, typing_extensions, and local literals module; type definitions and class declarations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code consists of type definitions and imports only, with no runtime data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow occurs as the code only defines types and classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines TypedDict classes for structured data used in SMS/voice API interactions, with conditional imports to support multiple Python versions. It includes no runtime logic, network access, or data processing that could be malicious. The inclusion of the copyright notice and documentation links is typical for open-source projects. No anomalies, suspicious imports, or potentially malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, version-compatible set of type definitions for a boto3-like SMS voice service API. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is consistent with open-source type annotations for SDKs or client libraries.",
