  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for SMS-Voice service components, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and third-party typing_extensions, as well as the static definitions and type annotations within the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no untrusted data processing or external data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code solely contains type definitions without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code structures detected. The code contains only type annotations and data structure definitions. The use of conditional imports for version compatibility is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules conditionally based on Python version, defines TypedDicts for various data structures used in the SMS-Voice service, and maintains clear, descriptive type annotations. No executable code, data processing, or external interactions are present that could be malicious. The structure adheres to standard type definition patterns without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of type definitions for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for type safety and documentation, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
