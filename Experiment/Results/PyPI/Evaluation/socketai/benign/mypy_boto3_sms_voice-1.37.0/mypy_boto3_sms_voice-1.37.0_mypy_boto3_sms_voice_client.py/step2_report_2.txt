  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Purely type annotations and class definitions; no runtime logic or data handling; no suspicious constructs.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues. The report's conclusion that this is a standard SDK stub with low risk is justified.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to report 1, with mention of URL generation and method signatures.  \n- **Potential concern:** URL generation (`generate_presigned_url`) can be used maliciously if parameters are untrusted, but in this code, it's just a method signature, not actual execution.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no actual URL generation or data processing occurs here.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard interface definitions, no runtime logic, no data handling, and the future-dated copyright (2025) is likely a typo or oversight.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 is justified.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the code appears legitimate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with standard method signatures and no data processing.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent with the content.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; this is a typical SDK interface.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, a standard client interface with no suspicious code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None.  \n- **Obfuscation:** Not present; code is straightforward.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities; method signatures and type annotations are standard.  \n- **Use of untrusted data or network operations:** Only method signatures are present; actual data flow or execution logic is absent.  \n- **Future-dated copyright:** Likely a typo, not malicious.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious code or behavior is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, the overall risk remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub for AWS boto3 SMS Voice service with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent.",
