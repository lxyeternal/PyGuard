  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 PinpointSMSVoice client, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS SMS-Voice services.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'sys.version_info' for conditional imports, and the class methods that wrap boto3 client operations with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Methods such as 'generate_presigned_url' that generate URLs, and other client methods that could potentially handle untrusted input if called with malicious parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from method calls flow into AWS SDK operations, and URL generation functions produce presigned URLs potentially based on untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures. Conditional imports based on Python version are standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and class wrapper for the boto3 AWS SDK, specifically for the PinpointSMSVoice client. It defines method signatures with appropriate type hints, conditional imports based on Python version, and a custom Exceptions class. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic. The presence of URL generation and method calls aligns with standard SDK usage. No hardcoded secrets or unusual data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type stub for the boto3 AWS SDK client with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an interface for safe type checking and documentation. No malware or security concerns are detected.",
