  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS boto3 SMS Voice service, serving as a structured SDK interface.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type definitions, and import statements; no data input/output or runtime logic.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or data leaks occur within this interface code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines method signatures and types, with no execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year 2025 is unusual and likely a placeholder or typo; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK stub with type annotations for the boto3 SMS Voice client. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity. The presence of generate_presigned_url and other method signatures does not imply malicious intent, as these are typical SDK features. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The future date in the copyright is likely a typo, not malicious. The malware score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the potential for URL misuse but not actual malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface for AWS SMS Voice service, with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent. The low risk score accurately reflects its benign nature.",
