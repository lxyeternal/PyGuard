  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS and SMS-Voice event types, intended for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Definition of string literals for event types and service names, no runtime data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright date (2025), likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type aliases, with conditional import for compatibility. No dynamic code, secrets, obfuscation, or network activity present. The only unusual element is the future year in the copyright notice, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static module defining string literal types for AWS services and SMS-Voice events. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
