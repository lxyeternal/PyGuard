{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations for various string literals representing AWS service and event types, used for type safety and validation in a Python AWS SDK stub.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys' module, conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', and defines several Literal type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants and type annotations without executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only declares type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright statement with a future date (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional importing based on Python version to maintain compatibility for 'Literal' typing. It defines multiple Literal type aliases for various AWS service names and event types, which serve as type hints. There is no execution of untrusted data, no network activity, no dynamic code, or obfuscated logic. The presence of a future copyright date appears to be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security. Overall, the code is straightforward and solely for type annotation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module providing type annotations for AWS service and event string literals. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright date, which is likely a typographical error but does not pose security concerns.",
