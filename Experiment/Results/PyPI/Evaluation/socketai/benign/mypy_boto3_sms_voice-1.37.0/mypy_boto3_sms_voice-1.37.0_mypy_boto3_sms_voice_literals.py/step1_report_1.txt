{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for specific string literals related to AWS services and SMS-Voice events for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases; no runtime input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the code only declares constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since the code only defines literals and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward type alias declarations, no dynamic code, no secret handling, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' and conditionally imports 'Literal' for Python versions before 3.12. (This is standard for compatibility.) It then declares several literal type aliases, mainly for AWS service names and event types. These are static and serve for type hinting and documentation. No user input, no dynamic code execution, no data handling or network operations are present. The only potential concern is the inclusion of the author's copyright notice, but this is benign and unrelated to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type alias declarations for documentation and type safety. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. It appears to be an intentionally simple, benign module for defining string literal types.",
