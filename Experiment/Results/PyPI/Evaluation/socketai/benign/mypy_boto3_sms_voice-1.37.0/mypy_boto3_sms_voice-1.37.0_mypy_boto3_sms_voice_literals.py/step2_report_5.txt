  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS services and SMS-Voice event types.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data, or network operations are present.\n- The only conditional logic is the import of `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.\n- The copyright notice states the year 2025, which is in the future relative to the knowledge cutoff (October 2023). This is unusual but likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, documentation-oriented, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes the static nature and benign purpose.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly emphasizes the static, documentation-like nature. The mention of extensive literal definitions is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is correct.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Highlights the conditional import and static definitions. Notes the future copyright date as an anomaly.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is correct.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, straightforward static type definitions. Correctly notes the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, benign, and serves for type annotations/documentation.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate given the absence of any malicious or insecure patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.0** — no security risks present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for AWS SDKs, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are consistent with this assessment. The only minor note is the future date in the copyright statement, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. No modifications or escalations are necessary. The code is safe and intended solely for static type hinting and documentation support.",
