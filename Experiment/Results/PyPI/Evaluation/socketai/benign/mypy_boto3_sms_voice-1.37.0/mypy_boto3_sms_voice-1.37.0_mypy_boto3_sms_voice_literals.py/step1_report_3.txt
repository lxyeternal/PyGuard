{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SMS-Voice service and various AWS service names to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reading the module's own literal definitions and import statements, particularly the import of 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources or data flows detected; the code only defines constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of conditional import for compatibility and straightforward literal type definitions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using 'Literal' for AWS service and SMS-Voice event types. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. The bulk of the code is literal definitions with no data processing, external calls, or input handling. There are no suspicious functions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. The only notable aspect is the extensive list of service name literals, but these are static definitions and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard type annotation utility intended to support type hints and documentation for AWS SDKs. It contains no malicious behavior, no data handling, and no security risks.",
