  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS service and event names used in the sms-voice module.",
  "sources": "Literal type definitions for EventTypeType, PinpointSMSVoiceServiceName, ServiceName, and ResourceServiceName.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no user input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines constants and types without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward type aliasing with no dynamic code, input, or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS service and event string literals, with conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version. No dynamic execution, user input processing, or external data handling exists. All definitions are static and serve as type hints for static analysis or IDE support. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The copyright notice and documentation links are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type definition module intended to improve type safety and IDE autocompletion for AWS-related string literals. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
