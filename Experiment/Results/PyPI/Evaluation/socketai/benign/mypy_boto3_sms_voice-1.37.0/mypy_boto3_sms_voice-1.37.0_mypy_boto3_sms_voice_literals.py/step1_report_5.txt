{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for SMS-Voice service event types and AWS service names for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and the assignment of string literals to type variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no external data handling, no network or file system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static literal definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code strictly defines type aliases using string literals. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No unusual code patterns or dynamic code execution. The only non-trivial logic is conditional import based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string literal types for AWS SDK or boto3-related usage, with a conditional import depending on Python version. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or side effects. The comments and documentation are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The use of literals for type safety and documentation purposes is typical and safe. There are no apparent malicious or sabotage elements in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type definition module for AWS service literals. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscation. The code's purpose is to provide type annotations for documentation and type checking, with no signs of security threats or malware.",
