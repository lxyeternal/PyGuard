{
  "purpose": "Provides tools for generating, embedding, and encoding QR codes in various formats, primarily for web use.",
  "sources": "Input data parameters in functions such as make_qr, make_qr_code_image, make_embedded_qr_code, make_qr_code_with_args, make_qr_code_url_with_args, and _options_from_args.",
  "sinks": "QR code generation functions (segno.make, qr.save, qr.png_data_uri, qr.svg_inline), HTML output via mark_safe with embedded data URIs, and base64 encoding of SVG data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into QR code generation functions, which process data and options, then produce image data or HTML tags embedding the QR code, possibly using data URIs or inline SVG.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network activity. Use of data URI for SVG embedding could be scrutinized but is standard for inline images. The code handles data encoding with multiple encodings but does not perform unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard QR code generation functionalities with validation, data encoding, and HTML embedding. It carefully escapes HTML attributes and handles data encoding for alt text. No suspicious external network requests, command execution, or credential handling is present. Usage of base64 encoding and data URIs is typical for embedding images. The presence of dependencies on secure libraries and validation via pydantic supports code safety. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate QR code utility module with no malicious behavior detected. It performs encoding and HTML embedding securely, with appropriate data handling and validation. No malware or supply chain threats are evident.",
