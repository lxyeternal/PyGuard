{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating, embedding, and URL-encoding QR codes with customizable options, ensuring safe HTML embedding and data handling.",
  "sources": "Function parameters for data and options; internal calls to segno library; data decoding for alt text.",
  "sinks": "Generated QR code images, inline SVGs, HTML <img> tags with embedded data URIs or inline SVGs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through QR code creation functions, with decoding and escaping for HTML embedding, culminating in safe HTML output or bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The alt text decoding handles multiple encodings safely. Data URI embedding is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code uses well-known libraries (segno, django, pydantic) with proper validation and escaping. No network calls, no malicious logic, and no obfuscation detected. The handling of untrusted data in alt text is cautious, and data URI embedding is a common, safe technique. The overall structure is clear and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe QR code utility with no supply chain security concerns. It employs standard practices, and no malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is justified due to data URI usage, which is common and safe when properly handled.",
