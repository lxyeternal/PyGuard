{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to generate QR codes, embed them in HTML, and generate URLs with QR code options, primarily for use in web applications.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters (`data`, `qr_code_args`, `qr_code_options`, etc.), including data that may be bytes or strings. Environment variables are not directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "The code generates QR code images and SVGs, embeds them as HTML safely, and creates data URIs. These are used for rendering QR codes in web pages. No dangerous sinks like system calls or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through `make_qr` functions, optionally converted to images or embedded in HTML. Data flows from user-provided arguments to QR code objects, then to safe HTML strings or data URIs. No untrusted data is used in insecure system operations or external network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are observed. The code uses standard libraries and well-known third-party libraries like `segno`, `django`, and `pydantic`. The decoding logic for `alt_text` includes multiple encodings but is standard practice and does not indicate obfuscation. No suspicious obfuscation or uncommon language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates QR codes from input data, with options for embedded images and HTML tags. It uses `pydantic` for input validation, which enhances safety. The functions handle different data types cautiously, with appropriate encoding and escaping. No data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident. The only potential concern is data URI embedding, which is a common and safe technique for inline images. No external network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate QR code generation utility with safe handling of inputs and outputs. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It uses standard practices and libraries for generating and embedding QR codes.",
