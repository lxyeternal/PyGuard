  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions for QR code creation, embedding, and URL generation. Inputs are from function parameters; no environment variables or external data sources.\n- **Sinks:** Generates safe HTML, images, data URIs. No system calls or network activity.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Data flows are straightforward; no suspicious anomalies. The decoding of `alt_text` uses multiple encodings but is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe QR code utility with no malicious behavior. Uses well-known libraries (`segno`, `django`, `pydantic`). The malware score is 0, and the security risk is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions with input validation via Pydantic.\n- **Sinks:** Embeds QR codes into HTML safely, uses base64 for SVGs.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior. The report assigns malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, which is reasonable given the safe data handling but notes minimal residual risk due to data URI embedding.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with validation and safe handling.\n- **Sinks:** Generates images, inline SVGs, HTML tags.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious anomalies. Proper escaping and encoding.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation. Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, which is acceptable considering the data URI usage.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, with standard data handling.\n- **Sinks:** Embeds images and SVGs safely.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Sinks:** Generates embedded QR code images, safe HTML.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies; proper escaping.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard QR code generation utility, with safe handling of data, proper escaping, and no external network or system calls.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) due to data URI embedding, but this is a common and accepted practice.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to data URI embedding, which is standard.\n\n**Note:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code's logic and behavior are consistent with safe QR code generation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a secure, standard implementation for QR code generation and embedding in web applications. The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications needed.",
