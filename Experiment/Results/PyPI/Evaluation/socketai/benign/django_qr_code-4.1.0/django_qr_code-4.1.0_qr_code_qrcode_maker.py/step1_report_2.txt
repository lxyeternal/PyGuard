{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions to generate QR codes in various formats, embed them into HTML, and generate URLs for QR code images, primarily using the segno library and integrating with Django.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data for QR code generation (`data` parameter), configuration options (`qr_code_options`, `qr_code_args`), and optionally environment or user data embedded in parameters or options.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs HTML-safe strings containing `<img>` tags with data URIs or inline SVGs, and URL strings for QR code images. It also generates QR code bytes and data URIs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (`data`, options, args) through QR code creation functions (`make_qr`, `make_qr_code_image`, etc.) and finally into HTML tags or data URIs, with optional decoding of byte data for alt text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code handles data encoding, base64 encoding for SVG images, and escapes HTML attributes properly. The only notable aspect is the decoding attempts for `alt_text` which could potentially be exploited if untrusted data is passed but is a standard practice for generating accessible images.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses the segno library to generate QR codes and safely embed them into HTML. It validates options with Pydantic, manages encoding for alt text, and constructs data URIs. No external network connections, credential handling, or system modifications are present. All functions operate within typical QR code generation patterns. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern could be if untrusted data is passed as `data`, but the code correctly encodes and escapes output, minimizing risks. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard QR code generation module using the segno library, with safe handling of data, HTML escaping, and data URI creation. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is detected. It does not exhibit obfuscation or malware characteristics. The security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use in applications requiring QR code generation.",
