  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, scoring justification, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No issues, safe code, standard libraries, proper validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The use of `pydantic`, `segno`, and safe HTML handling supports this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9). Mentions potential concern with `alt_text` decoding but notes it as standard practice.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (slightly higher, possibly due to decoding logic)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The decoding for `alt_text` is a common pattern and does not introduce security issues if handled correctly. The risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable, given the minimal potential for misuse. The overall conclusion remains that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar positive assessment, emphasizing safe handling, validation, and standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (slightly higher than previous, perhaps due to the data URI embedding)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Data URI embedding is standard and not inherently risky. The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behaviors. The risk score is still low, justified by the safe handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with prior reports, highlighting safe data handling, validation, and standard encoding practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's functionality. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, confirming the code's legitimacy and safety.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard utility with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None detected in any report.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's functionality.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) mainly due to data URI embedding and alt text decoding, but these are standard practices and do not pose significant security risks.\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured QR code generation module.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- Data URI embedding, while sometimes scrutinized, is a common and safe technique for inline images.\n- The decoding logic for `alt_text` is standard and does not introduce vulnerabilities, especially since outputs are escaped and marked safe.\n- The use of `pydantic` validation further reduces risks of injection or malformed input.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to data URI usage, which is standard)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and justified. No further changes are necessary. The code is safe for deployment in production environments requiring QR code generation and embedding.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware Score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated Score: **0**  \n- Risk Score: **0.1**",
