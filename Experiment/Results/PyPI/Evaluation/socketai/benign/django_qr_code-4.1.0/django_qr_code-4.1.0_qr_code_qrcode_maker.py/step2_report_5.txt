  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard QR code generation, no external or malicious sources.\n- **Sinks:** Generates images, SVGs, safe HTML; no network or system calls.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from input to safe output, with no suspicious steps.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, safe, and uses standard practices. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with emphasis on safe data handling.\n- **Sinks:** Embeds QR codes into HTML, data URIs, inline SVGs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; handles alt text decoding carefully.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard QR code generation with safe data handling. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the slight risk accounts for data URI usage, which is common but can sometimes be misused if untrusted data is passed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose, with validation via Pydantic.\n- **Sinks:** Generates images, SVGs, HTML tags.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent, acknowledging minimal risk due to data embedding.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizing safe data handling.\n- **Sinks:** Data URIs, inline SVGs, HTML embedding.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; standard techniques.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, safe for typical use.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard QR code generation, no external threats.\n- **Sinks:** Embedding images, HTML, data URIs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or credential handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports due to data URI embedding, which is a common technique but can be misused if untrusted data is passed. However, the code properly escapes and validates data, minimizing this risk.\n\n### **My Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, due to the use of data URIs, but overall safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented QR code utility module with no indications of supply chain threats or malicious behavior. The slight risk score reflects the common usage of data URIs, which is generally safe when used properly, as in this code.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Keep the risk score at 0.1, malware at 0, obfuscated at 0. It aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's characteristics.",
