  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly describes functions for QR code creation, embedding, and URL generation. Inputs are from function parameters; no environment variables accessed.\n- **Sinks:** Generates images, SVGs, HTML tags, safe embedding.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious external calls or hardcoded secrets. Decoding alt text from data bytes is standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, uses well-known libraries, and handles data securely. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. All reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, with input validation via Pydantic.\n- **Sinks:** Embeds QR codes as data URIs or inline SVGs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, but notes that decoding `alt_text` could be exploited if untrusted data is passed—though this is standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external network calls, no backdoors. The only minor concern is handling untrusted data in alt text, which is mitigated by escaping.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (slightly above zero due to potential for untrusted data in alt text).\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly conservative but justified; no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar QR code functions, with validation.\n- **Sinks:** HTML, data URIs, SVGs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, standard data encoding practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard practices, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (again, a small risk due to data handling).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, with safe data handling.\n- **Sinks:** Embedding images, SVGs, HTML.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, with proper escaping and validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, with validation.\n- **Sinks:** Data URIs, HTML embedding.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, standard techniques.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate QR code utility, safe handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no network, no system calls, no suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports due to handling of untrusted data (e.g., alt text decoding), which is a minor concern but not critical.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard QR code generation module.\n- It uses well-known libraries (`segno`, `django`, `pydantic`) with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The only minor concern is handling untrusted data in alt text, which is mitigated by proper escaping.\n- No external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n| Score Type | Justification |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| **Malware** | 0 — No malicious behavior observed. |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0 — Clear, straightforward code. |\n| **Risk** | 0.1 — Minor risk due to potential untrusted data in alt text, but overall very safe. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with minimal risk, and no malware or obfuscation present. The existing reports' scores are appropriate.",
