  "purpose": "The code serves to generate and serve QR code images based on request parameters, with optional caching and access protection via tokens or user permissions.",
  "sources": "Request parameters ('bytes', 'text', 'int', 'token', 'cache_enabled'), HTTP request data, query string parameters, and settings/configurations.",
  "sinks": "Response object returning image data; signature verification functions (signer.unsign) potentially manipulating data for token validation.",
  "flows": "Request parameters are read; access permissions are checked; token is validated via signature; data is decoded from base64 or integer; QR code is generated and returned as image.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding without strict input validation; token signature verification relies on external signer configuration; no obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets within code; parameters handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a QR code service with optional caching and access control via token signatures. It properly decodes input data from request parameters, handles exceptions for invalid base64 and integer values, and verifies signatures using Django's signing framework. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. The code is straightforward, mainly orchestrating request handling, token validation, and QR code generation. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. Use of external libraries is standard, and no hardcoded secrets are visible beyond standard signing keys fetched from configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical secure implementation of a QR code generation service with access controls. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware characteristics. The only potential concern is reliance on external configuration for signing keys, which should be securely managed, but this is standard practice. Overall, the code appears secure and free from malicious intent.",
