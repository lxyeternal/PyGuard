  "purpose": "Serve QR code images based on request parameters with optional caching and access control via tokens or user permissions.",
  "sources": "Request parameters: 'bytes', 'int', 'text', 'token', 'cache_enabled', and other query string arguments for QRCodeOptions.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data used for QR code generation; signature verification via Django's Signer; permission checks raising exceptions if invalid.",
  "flows": "Request parameters are decoded and validated, signature tokens are verified, then data is passed to QR code generator, response returned as image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; standard use of Django's Signer; no suspicious or obfuscated code; proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic validation, input validation, and permission checks. It decodes data from URL parameters, verifies signatures with external keys, and generates QR codes accordingly. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External signing keys are used, which should be securely managed, but this is outside the code scope. Error handling is appropriate, and the code structure is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for serving QR codes with access control. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is detected. The security risk is low, primarily dependent on external key management. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard security considerations.",
