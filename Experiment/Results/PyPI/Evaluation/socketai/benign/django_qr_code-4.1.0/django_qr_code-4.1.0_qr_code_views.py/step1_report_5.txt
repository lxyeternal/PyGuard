  "purpose": "This code serves QR code images based on request parameters, with optional caching and access control via tokens or user permissions.",
  "sources": "Input data from request.GET parameters: 'bytes', 'int', 'text', 'token', 'cache_enabled', and other query parameters for QRCodeOptions.",
  "sinks": "make_qr_code_image function generates the QR code; HttpResponse returns the image; get_qr_code_option_from_request processes query parameters; check_url_signature_token verifies token signature.",
  "flows": "Input data (base64, integer, or text) flows from request.GET through decoding/validation -> to make_qr_code_image -> response to client; tokens are verified via signature checks before access is granted.",
  "anomalies": "Proper input validation with base64 and integer decoding; use of signing with Django's Signer for token validation; no hardcoded secrets detected; no evident malicious code or backdoors. The code correctly handles exceptions for invalid input.",
  "analysis": "The code processes user inputs from URL parameters to generate QR codes, with optional caching controlled by settings and request flags. It uses Django's signing framework for token validation, preventing unauthorized access. All inputs are validated for correct encoding and data types, and access is restricted via permission checks. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions perform expected tasks related to QR code generation and access control without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure and well-structured, performing intended functions with proper validation and access control. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The security risk is low, primarily limited to standard URL parameter validation and token signing mechanisms.",
