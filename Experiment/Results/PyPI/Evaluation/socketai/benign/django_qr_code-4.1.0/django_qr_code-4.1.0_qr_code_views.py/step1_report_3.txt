  "purpose": "Serve QR code images with configurable options and optional access protection via signed tokens.",
  "sources": "Request query parameters (e.g., 'bytes', 'text', 'int', 'token'), user object (request.user), settings (settings.QR_CODE_CACHE_ALIAS, settings.CACHES).",
  "sinks": "Base64 decoding (potentially unsafe input handling), QR code generation (make_qr_code_image), signature verification (signer.unsign), HTTP response with image data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('bytes', 'text', 'int') -> Decoding/validation -> QR code generation -> Response; Token verification -> Signature check -> Access control.",
  "anomalies": "No evident hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of standard signing mechanism. No malicious payloads or suspicious external requests detected. Input handling includes base64 decoding with error handling, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles input validation, QR code generation, and optional access control. It validates base64-encoded data and integers, handles exceptions properly, and verifies signatures for tokens using Django's signing framework. The use of standard libraries and functions appears legitimate. No evidence of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or external network communication beyond intended functions. The security measures include signature validation and permission checks, indicating awareness of supply chain risks. The code appears well-structured for its purpose with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a QR code generator with optional access control via signed tokens. It employs standard security practices, input validation, and error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
