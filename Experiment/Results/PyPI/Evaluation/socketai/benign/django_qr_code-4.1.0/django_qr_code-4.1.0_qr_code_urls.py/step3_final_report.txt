  "purpose": "Defines a Django URL pattern for serving QR code images, configurable via settings.",
  "sources": "The setting 'SERVE_QR_CODE_IMAGE_PATH' accessed via getattr, and the URL pattern mapping to 'views.serve_qr_code_image'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Configuration setting -> URL pattern -> view function; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'getattr' for configuration is standard; no suspicious or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and URL functions, then creates a URL pattern that uses 'getattr' to retrieve a configurable path with a default. It maps this path to a view. No user input, external data, or code injection points are present. The use of 'getattr' with a default is typical for configurable URLs. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are evident. The setting could be misconfigured, but this is outside the code's scope. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (~0.1), justified by configuration reliance but not a vulnerability. Confidence is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration with a configurable path. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
