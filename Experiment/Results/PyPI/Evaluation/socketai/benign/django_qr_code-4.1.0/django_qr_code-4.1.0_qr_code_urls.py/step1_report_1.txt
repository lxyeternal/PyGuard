  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for serving QR code images in a Django web application",
  "sources": "Reading the 'SERVE_QR_CODE_IMAGE_PATH' setting from Django settings",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present",
  "flows": "Fetching configuration from settings; URL pattern mapping to view function",
  "anomalies": "Use of gettattr with a default value for URL path; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and URL configuration functions. It dynamically retrieves the 'SERVE_QR_CODE_IMAGE_PATH' setting with a default value, then maps a URL path to the 'serve_qr_code_image' view. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks. The use of gettattr is standard for configurable paths. No untrusted data sources or dangerous sinks are identified. Overall, this is a typical Django URL configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward URL configuration with configurable path settings; no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
