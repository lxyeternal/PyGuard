  "purpose": "Define URL routing for QR code image serving in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration setting 'SERVE_QR_CODE_IMAGE_PATH' from Django settings.",
  "sinks": "The URL pattern that directs requests to 'views.serve_qr_code_image'.",
  "flows": "Configuration value from settings is used to determine the URL path; incoming requests to that path are handled by the view.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'getattr' with a default path is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and a views module. It defines an app namespace 'qr_code' and a URL pattern that dynamically retrieves a path from Django settings, defaulting to 'images/serve-qr-code-image/'. This pattern routes requests to 'serve_qr_code_image' view. The use of 'getattr' for configuration is typical and does not suggest malicious intent. No input/output data handling, no external data fetching, or code obfuscation present. The code appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This code sets up URL routing with a configurable path for serving QR code images. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard Django URL configuration code.",
