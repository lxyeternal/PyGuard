  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for serving QR code images in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reading the setting 'SERVE_QR_CODE_IMAGE_PATH' from Django settings.",
  "sinks": "The URL pattern that uses the setting value to define the path for serving images.",
  "flows": "The setting value is retrieved and used as the URL path for the 'serve_qr_code_image' view.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'getattr' to obtain a configurable path; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and a views module, sets up URL routing with a configurable path using 'getattr' on Django settings, providing a default value. The URL pattern directs requests to 'serve_qr_code_image'. No external data input, data leakage, or malicious code behavior observed. The dynamic path configuration appears standard and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical URL configuration for serving images with configurable path. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The use of 'getattr' with a default value is safe and standard practice.",
