  "conclusion": "The assessments are appropriate; reports with no code are correctly scored as low risk. Report 5's moderate suspicion is well-captured by its scores. Slight score increases for malware and risk in report 5 are recommended for a more cautious stance. No further action needed unless additional code or context is provided."
