  "sources": "No external input or data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could be exploited are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard Django conventions. No unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with basic configuration attributes: 'name' and 'verbose_name'. It contains no input handling, external data processing, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, data leaks, or hidden network activities. The structure and syntax are typical for Django app configurations.",
