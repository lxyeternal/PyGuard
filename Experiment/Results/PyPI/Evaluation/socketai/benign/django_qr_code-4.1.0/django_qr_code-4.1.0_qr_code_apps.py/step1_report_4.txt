{
  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration for the 'qr_code' app with a verbose name.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import and the class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AppConfig from django.apps and defines a subclass with static attributes 'name' and 'verbose_name'. This is standard Django configuration syntax. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, nor any potentially malicious constructs. It appears to be a typical configuration file for a Django app, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django app configuration class with no malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
