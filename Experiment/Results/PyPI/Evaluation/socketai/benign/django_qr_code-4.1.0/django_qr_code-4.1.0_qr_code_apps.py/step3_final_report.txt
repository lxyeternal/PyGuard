  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static Django AppConfig subclass that sets app name and verbose name. No dynamic behavior, input processing, external dependencies, or network activity are present. The code adheres to standard conventions and contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign appropriate scores. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with full confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions.",
