  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing paths, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for Django apps.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's AppConfig, defines a subclass with two attributes specifying the app's internal name and verbose display name. It follows standard Django conventions without any dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or data handling logic. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to register the 'qr_code' app within a Django project.",
