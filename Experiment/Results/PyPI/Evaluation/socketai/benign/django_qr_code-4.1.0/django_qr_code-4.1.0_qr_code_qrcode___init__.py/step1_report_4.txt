  "purpose": "Define a configuration dictionary for Pydantic with specific settings.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, network calls, or sensitive operations observed.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected; straightforward use of Pydantic's ConfigDict.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ConfigDict from Pydantic and creates a configuration object with arbitrary_types_allowed set to True. This is a standard configuration setting that permits the use of arbitrary types in Pydantic models. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The code is minimal and typical for configuring Pydantic models.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for Pydantic and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
