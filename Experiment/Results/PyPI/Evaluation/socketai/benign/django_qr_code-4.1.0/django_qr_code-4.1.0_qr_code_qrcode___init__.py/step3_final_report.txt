  "flows": "Import -> Configuration assignment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward configuration with no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports ConfigDict from pydantic and creates a configuration object with arbitrary_types_allowed set to True. This is a standard configuration setting in Pydantic, used to permit models to accept arbitrary Python types. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling. The setting can pose security risks if misused in larger contexts, but in this isolated snippet, it is benign. All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pydantic configuration snippet with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of arbitrary_types_allowed=True, while potentially risky in broader applications, does not pose a threat here. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
