  "purpose": "Define a configuration dictionary for Pydantic with specific settings.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'ConfigDict' from the 'pydantic' library and then uses it to create a configuration object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are used or processed in this code.",
  "flows": "Import -> Configuration instantiation; there are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses a standard library feature without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'ConfigDict' from 'pydantic', a well-known validation library, and creates a configuration dictionary allowing arbitrary types. This is a common pattern for customizing Pydantic models. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for configuring Pydantic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup for Pydantic without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
