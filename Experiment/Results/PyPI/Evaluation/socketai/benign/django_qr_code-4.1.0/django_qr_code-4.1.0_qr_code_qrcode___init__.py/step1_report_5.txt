  "purpose": "Define a configuration dictionary for Pydantic models allowing arbitrary types.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pydantic library, assignment to PYDANTIC_CONFIG.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import -> Configuration assignment, no data flow from external or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ConfigDict with 'arbitrary_types_allowed=True' could be a concern if misused, but in this context it is standard Pydantic usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ConfigDict from pydantic and creates a configuration object allowing arbitrary types. There is no user input, data processing, or network communication. The configuration setting is a common feature of Pydantic and does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration setup for Pydantic models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign and standard use of the pydantic library.",
