  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the same setup script for the 'django-qr-code' package.\n- They agree that the script reads version info from 'qr_code/__init__.py' via regex, reads static files ('README.md' and 'LICENSE'), and calls `setuptools.setup()` with metadata.\n- None report any suspicious code, dynamic execution, external commands, or handling of untrusted data.\n- All conclude that the script is standard, straightforward, and free of malicious activity.\n- Confidence is high (mostly 1), and no report indicates obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code matches the described behavior: no anomalies, no hidden code, no suspicious logic.\n- The version extraction via regex is common and safe.\n- No untrusted data handling or code execution is observed.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical flaws or security flaws.\n- The only minor note is that regex-based version extraction, while common, can be fragile if the format changes, but this is standard practice and not a security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** No significant flaws or mistakes detected.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which is negligible and possibly overestimating minor risks like reading files. Given the evidence, a score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** Adjust the security risk score to 0 across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The only concern might be the regex version extraction, but this is standard and safe.\n- No external data, no code injection, no network activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The high scores (>0.5) are unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- No malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are cautious and correct in their assessment.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- Scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The minimal security risk score should be 0, not 0.1.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n- Obfuscated remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is standard, safe, and free of suspicious or malicious behavior. The regex-based version extraction, while potentially fragile, is a common pattern and not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The only adjustment needed is to set the security risk score to 0 across all reports for consistency and accuracy.",
