{
  "purpose": "This script prepares the packaging configuration for the 'django-qr-code' Python package, including reading metadata, dependencies, and version information.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'qr_code/__init__.py', reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'LICENSE' for license info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted code or handle untrusted data; static file reads are safe.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and metadata from files; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The version is extracted via regex, which is a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration for packaging a Python module. It reads the version number from a source file using regex, reads documentation and license files, and passes this information to setuptools. No untrusted input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity are present. All dependencies are specified explicitly. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package with no malicious intent. It securely reads local files and configures package metadata without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data.",
