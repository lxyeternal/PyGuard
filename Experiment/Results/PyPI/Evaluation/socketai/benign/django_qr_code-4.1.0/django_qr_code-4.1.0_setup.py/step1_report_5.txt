{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'django-qr-code', including reading package metadata, dependencies, and version info for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'qr_code/__init__.py', and reads content from 'README.md' and 'LICENSE' files.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is written or used in a way that affects security or leaks data.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, then uses that data to configure package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard setup tasks without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup operations: reading version info via regex, loading documentation and license files, and configuring setup() with metadata. The version extraction avoids importing the package, which is a common practice. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or use of sensitive data is observed. The dependencies listed are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Django QR code application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of open-source package distribution.",
