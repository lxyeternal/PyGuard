{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package called 'django-qr-code' with metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from 'qr_code/__init__.py', reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'LICENSE' file.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted code execution or external data leaks. No external commands or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from the '__init__.py' file and used in package setup; other data is read from static files and assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reads to gather package metadata, extracts version info via regex, and calls 'setup()' with this data. It does not execute any untrusted code or perform network operations. Usage of 'setuptools' for packaging is standard. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It reads static data, extracts version info safely, and prepares the package for distribution.",
