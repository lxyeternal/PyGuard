{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'django-qr-code', including metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'qr_code/__init__.py', reads files 'README.md' and 'LICENSE' for long description and license text.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands; no insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, then uses that data in the setup function; file content is not modified or executed dynamically beyond reading.",
  "anomalies": "The version extraction uses regex on file content, but this is a common and safe practice; no unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration for a Python package with no suspicious activities. It carefully extracts version info without importing modules, reads documentation and license files, and specifies dependencies and metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations are related to package configuration. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses common practices for package metadata and dependency specification. No malware or security concerns detected.",
