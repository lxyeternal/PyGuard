  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'django-qr-code' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'qr_code/__init__.py' via regex; reads static files 'README.md' and 'LICENSE'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, code execution, or external commands present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and version info, then passes data to setuptools.setup() without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, conventional setup script that safely reads static files and version info. No dynamic or untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior is detected. The regex-based version extraction is a common pattern and not risky. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report overestimates the actual risk, which is effectively zero.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a security risk score of 0. The minor risk score of 0.1 is unjustified and should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
