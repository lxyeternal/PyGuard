  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- It reads version info from 'qr_code/__init__.py' via regex, avoiding import.\n- It reads 'README.md' and 'LICENSE' files for long description and license info.\n- It calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data.\n- The code appears straightforward and adheres to common practices.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Correctly describes the code's purpose.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No suspicious data flows or sinks.\n- Anomalies: No unusual patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No malicious activity, standard setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes static file reads, safe regex extraction.\n- No suspicious code or behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same overall conclusion, standard setup pattern.\n- No dynamic or malicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, standard practices, no anomalies.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusion, with a slightly higher securityRisk score of 0.1.\n- The mention of 0.1 seems to be an overestimate; the code does not handle sensitive data or perform risky operations.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly overestimated; the code does not present any security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n- The version extraction via regex is common and safe.\n- The only minor point is the securityRisk score of 0.1 in the last report, which is unjustified given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- Clear, straightforward code; no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- The code is a typical setup script with no security risks.  \n- The last report's 0.1 is slightly high; I would set it to 0.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores I recommend:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0             |\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any supply chain or security threat.\n- No need for concern or further investigation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a legitimate, safe setup script with no malicious or security concerns.",
