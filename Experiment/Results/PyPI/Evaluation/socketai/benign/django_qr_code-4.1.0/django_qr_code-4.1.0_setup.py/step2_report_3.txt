  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, logic, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- It reads version info via regex from `qr_code/__init__.py`, which is common practice.\n- It reads static files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`) for metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate, describes standard setup.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data or external commands.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Same findings, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score: 0.1.\n- **Reasoning:** The report states no suspicious code but notes a small risk due to the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's simplicity and safety, this risk score seems overestimated. The code doesn't perform any risky operations; reading files and regex parsing are safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk:** Most reports assign 0, except Report 5 assigns 0.1, which seems unjustified given the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks present.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n\n- The code does not execute any untrusted code, nor does it handle user input or network data.\n- The version extraction via regex is safe and common.\n- No signs of supply chain attack or malicious payload.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**I agree with the majority of the reports. The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements.**\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0**\n\nThis assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious activity.",
