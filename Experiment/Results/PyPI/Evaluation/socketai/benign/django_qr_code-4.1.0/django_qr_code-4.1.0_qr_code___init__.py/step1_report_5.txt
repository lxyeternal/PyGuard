  "anomalies": "Lack of any functional code, no suspicious activity, only version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no potential for malicious activity. The absence of other code components suggests this is a benign, standard version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version assignment statement with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
