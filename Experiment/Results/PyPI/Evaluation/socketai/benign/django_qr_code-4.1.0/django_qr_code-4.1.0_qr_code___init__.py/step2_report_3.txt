  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code review:**\nThe code is simply:\n```python\n__version__ = \"4.1.0\"\n```\nThis is a standard practice in Python packages to declare the version. There are no inputs, no data flows, no external calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious code present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify this as benign, standard version assignment.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They all recognize the code as harmless and typical.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Logical reasoning and assumptions:\n- The reports correctly assume that assigning a version string to `__version__` is a benign, standard practice.\n- No assumptions about hidden behavior are made, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:** None needed; all scores are reasonable.\n- **Risk justification:** Since all scores are zero, no further justification is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward version declaration with no security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
