  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There is no evidence of external input, data flow, or any malicious activity.\n   - The code snippets are minimal and standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is a straightforward version string assignment, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - All reports correctly assign a `securityRisk` of 0.\n   - No evidence suggests any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is indicated.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis code is a standard, harmless version declaration in a Python package. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are accurate and consistent.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.",
