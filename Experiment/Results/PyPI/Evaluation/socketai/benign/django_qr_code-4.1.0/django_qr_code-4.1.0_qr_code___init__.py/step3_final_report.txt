  "purpose": "This code declares a static version string for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or untrusted input used.",
  "flows": "Single source: static string assignment; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string, typical in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, data flows, or external calls are present. All reports confirm its benign nature. The code lacks any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
