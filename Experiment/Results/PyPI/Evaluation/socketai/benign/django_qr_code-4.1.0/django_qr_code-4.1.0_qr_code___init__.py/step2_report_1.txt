  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code only assigns a static version string (`\"4.1.0\"`) to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. The code is minimal and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**  \nNo errors or logical flaws are evident in any report. The code is straightforward and follows common conventions. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n3. **Score Justification and Reasonableness**  \n- **Malware Score (0):** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, as there's no obfuscation or hidden code.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0):** Also appropriate, since the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**  \n- The reports correctly assume that assigning a static version string is harmless.  \n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code's simplicity supports this.\n\n5. **Score Consistency and Recommendations**  \n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.  \n- No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The code is a standard version declaration, common in Python packages.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0.\n\n**My personal estimate based on all the information:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is entirely benign and typical for version declaration in Python packages. No further action or concern is warranted.",
