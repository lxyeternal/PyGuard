{
  "purpose": "This code provides Django template tags to generate QR codes for various types of data such as text, URLs, contact information, geolocation, media, and other specialized data formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to template tags, including strings, data objects, dictionaries, and keyword arguments. Specific data sources include user input for contact details, coordinates, URLs, and IDs.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external functions `make_qr_code_with_args` and `make_qr_code_url_with_args` which generate QR code data. These functions are potential sinks if they handle untrusted input insecurely.",
  "flows": "User-provided data (e.g., text, URLs, contact objects) flow into QR code generation functions via template tags, potentially passing through data transformations or object constructions before being used in QR code creation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears standard for a Django app generating QR codes. No unusual network activity or hidden behaviors are evident. Usage of `pop` on kwargs and dynamic object creation are standard patterns, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Django template tags for generating QR codes from various data sources. It utilizes input validation by type-checking objects and converting strings into specific classes like `Email`. The functions mainly call external QR code creation utilities with the provided data and options. No dangerous code injection, data exfiltration, or external network calls are visible within this module. It relies on external libraries for QR code creation, which are assumed to be safe. The code structure is clear, with proper parameter handling and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of Django template tags for QR code generation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within its scope. It mainly orchestrates data flow into QR code creation functions. No suspicious activity or malware indicators are detected.",
