{
  "purpose": "This code provides Django template tags for generating QR codes from various data types such as text, URLs, contact info, geolocation, media, and more, for rendering in templates.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments such as text, data, email, phone numbers, coordinates, and complex objects like contacts, vcard, wifi configs, etc. User-controlled data can originate from template context variables.",
  "sinks": "Data is passed to functions like make_qr_code_with_args and make_qr_code_url_with_args, which generate QR code images or URLs. The QR code data is constructed internally; no direct data leakage points are evident in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (from function arguments, especially template variables) flows into QR code generation functions, which produce QR images or URLs. There are no external system calls, network requests, or file operations directly visible in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code mostly delegates to external functions for QR code creation, which are not included here; no dynamic code execution or insecure practices are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines Django template tags that convert input data into QR code images or URLs using helper functions. It performs type checks for objects like Email, and uses dict unpacking for flexible data handling. No direct user input is processed insecurely; the inputs are passed directly to QR code generation functions, assuming they handle sanitization internally. The code does not perform external network requests or write to files, limiting external attack surfaces. Overall, the structure appears standard and safe, with no evident malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Django template tags for QR code generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external QR code creation functions, which should be reviewed separately for security. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected.",
