  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code handles QR code URL generation, signing, and protection. It reads configuration from Django settings, encodes data, signs tokens, and constructs URLs.\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets beyond `settings.SECRET_KEY`. The `_RANDOM_TOKEN` is generated once at module load, which might lead to predictability or replay issues but is not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Assessment:** The logic is sound, standard cryptographic signing is used, and no malicious behavior is evident. The static token is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing URL signing and token reuse concerns.\n- **Key points:** Same as above, with emphasis on the static `_RANDOM_TOKEN`. No malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code appears secure; the static token reuse could weaken security but isn't malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on URL signing, token generation, and encoding.\n- **Key points:** Uses Django's signing utilities properly. No obfuscation or malicious code. The static token is noted but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The implementation is standard and secure, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis, noting the static `_RANDOM_TOKEN` and proper use of signing.\n- **Key points:** No malicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe; the static token is a minor concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion, emphasizing the security practices.\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets besides `SECRET_KEY`, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code is secure and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Use of secrets:** Standard use of Django's `SECRET_KEY`.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only consistent concern is the static `_RANDOM_TOKEN` generated once at module load, which could reduce token freshness and security per request, but this is a design choice rather than malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero, at 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about token reuse but not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justified Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor security concern due to static token reuse, but not malicious)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-implemented QR code URL generation utility with signing and protection features. No evidence suggests malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The only minor issue is the static token `_RANDOM_TOKEN`, which could be improved for security but does not constitute malicious activity.\n\n**Recommended action:** No immediate security threat identified. Consider generating per-request tokens for enhanced security, but overall, the code is safe.",
