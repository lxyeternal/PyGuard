  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for QR code URL generation and signing.\n- Findings: Uses Django's signing, configuration, and data encoding. No hardcoded secrets besides SECRET_KEY. The static `_RANDOM_TOKEN` is generated once at module load, which could lead to predictability or replay issues but isn't malicious.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Comments: The static token is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, standard practices are followed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Secure QR code URL generation with optional signing.\n- Findings: Similar to above, with emphasis on the static `_RANDOM_TOKEN` potentially reducing security. No signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Comments: Same minor concern about token reuse; no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Generating and validating QR code URLs with signing.\n- Findings: Proper use of Django's signing, no backdoors or obfuscation. The static token is noted but not malicious.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Generating signed QR code URLs.\n- Findings: Uses standard cryptographic signing, no malicious behavior. Static token at module load is a minor concern.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utilities for generating and protecting QR code URLs.\n- Findings: Same as above, no malicious activity. Static token is a minor issue.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues in Code:**  \n  The code functions as intended, implementing URL signing, token generation, and QR code URL construction. No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscation or Hidden Malicious Code:**  \n  None detected. The code is clear, uses standard libraries, and follows typical patterns.\n\n- **Malware or Malicious Intent:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Use of Static `_RANDOM_TOKEN`:**  \n  Reused across all requests, which could weaken security by making tokens predictable or less unique per request. However, this is a design concern, not malicious.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n  The only notable concern is the static token's potential to reduce security effectiveness, but it does not constitute malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the evidence. Security risk scores are 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about token reuse, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious logic detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.2  \n- Slight concern about static token reuse, but overall security practices are sound.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard implementation of QR code URL generation with signing and protection features. It uses best practices like URL signing, base64 encoding, and configuration-driven options. The only minor concern is the static `_RANDOM_TOKEN`, which could be improved for better security, but this does not imply malicious intent or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe supply chain security posture of this code appears solid, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
