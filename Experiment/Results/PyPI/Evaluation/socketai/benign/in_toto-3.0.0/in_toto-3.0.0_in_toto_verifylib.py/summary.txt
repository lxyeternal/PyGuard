  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured supply chain verification library performing cryptographic validation, rule enforcement, and recursive layout handling. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The execution of inspection commands via subprocess is controlled and expected in this context. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is sound."
