  "purpose": "Configure a custom logger for the in-toto library, providing logging levels, formatting, and convenience methods for verbosity control.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'logging', 'sys', and 'in_toto.settings'; use of environment/configuration to determine debug mode.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to sys.stderr via a StreamHandler; potential error info and stack traces in debug mode.",
  "flows": "Logging configuration occurs during module import, affecting subsequent logs; no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard logging setup with custom error handling and level control; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of the standard Python logger to add an error method that conditionally shows stack traces when in DEBUG mode. It also provides a convenience method for setting verbosity levels based on boolean flags. The logger configuration dynamically adjusts the logging level and format depending on the 'in_toto.settings.DEBUG' flag. The setup writes logs to sys.stderr using a standard StreamHandler. There is no use of external or untrusted inputs for log configuration beyond environment variables, and no suspicious or malicious code is present. The code strictly manages logging behavior without performing any system modifications, data collection, or network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It provides flexible logging levels and detailed debug information when enabled. There are no anomalies or malicious signals detected.",
