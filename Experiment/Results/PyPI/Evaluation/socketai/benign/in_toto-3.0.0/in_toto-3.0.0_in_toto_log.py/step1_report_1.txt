  "purpose": "Configure in-toto base logger for debugging and user feedback in command line interfaces and libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements (logging, sys, in_toto.settings); configuration of logger class and level; logger methods (error, setLevelVerboseOrQuiet).",
  "sinks": "Logger output to sys.stderr via StreamHandler, primarily for logging messages; error method may include stack traces if in DEBUG mode.",
  "flows": "Logging methods (error, warning, info) output messages; error method conditionally includes stack trace if in DEBUG mode and an exception is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. Custom error method adjusts stack trace display based on DEBUG mode. The setLevelVerboseOrQuiet method adjusts logging levels based on CLI flags.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard logging configuration module with custom subclassing for enhanced error reporting. It includes a custom logger class with a modified error method that adds stack traces conditionally, based on DEBUG mode and exception presence. The logger level is set dynamically based on in_toto.settings.DEBUG, with an option for verbosity control through CLI flags. No code injections, malicious behaviors, or suspicious activity are observed. All third-party library usage is legitimate and necessary for logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured logger configuration script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It implements customizable logging for debugging purposes without exposing sensitive data or performing harmful actions.",
