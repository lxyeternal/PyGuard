  "purpose": "Configure the in-toto base logger for debugging and user feedback, setting log levels and formats based on settings.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from in_toto.settings and input from function parameters like verbose and quiet.",
  "sinks": "Outputs log messages to sys.stderr via a StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Input settings determine log level -> configured logger outputs messages to stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The custom error method conditionally shows stack traces only during DEBUG mode, which is standard for debugging. No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code sets logger class temporarily, which is common in logging customizations. No external network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logger class inheriting from the standard logging.Logger, adding a tailored error method that conditionally shows stack traces only in DEBUG mode. It also provides a convenience method to set verbosity levels based on command line arguments. The global logger is configured with a StreamHandler and appropriate formatting depending on DEBUG settings, and it correctly resets the logger class afterward. The implementation follows standard practices for configurable logging and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data leaks, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured logging configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages logging levels and output formatting based on user settings. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
