{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for starting and stopping in-toto supply chain recording steps, creating signed link metadata files.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, environment variables (implicitly via getpass), and file paths for signing keys and materials.",
  "sinks": "Uses in_toto's signing and recording functions, which perform cryptographic signing and file operations; no direct data leaks or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Inputs from user arguments and files flow into in_toto's record and sign functions; no untrusted data directly influences system commands or network operations within this script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code follows standard patterns for argument parsing and cryptographic signing. Use of getpass() for password input is secure. No obfuscated or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles argument parsing, key loading, and invoking in_toto functions for supply chain metadata recording. It ensures only one signing method (GPG or PKCS8) is used and securely prompts for passwords. The cryptographic functions are imported from in_toto's library and are likely to handle signing securely. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. All data flows are through standard and well-understood mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets or network connections are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper for in-toto supply chain recording functions. It follows standard security practices, does not contain malicious code, and performs expected operations for its purpose.",
