  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure CLI wrapper for in_toto's supply chain signing functions. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious activity is detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 is justified given its cryptographic handling but no inherent vulnerabilities."
