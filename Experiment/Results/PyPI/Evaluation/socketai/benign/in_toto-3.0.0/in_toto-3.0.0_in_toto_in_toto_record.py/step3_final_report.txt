  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for in_toto signing and metadata functions, handling signer loading, argument parsing, and logging.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variables, user input via getpass.",
  "sinks": "Delegates signing and file operations to trusted in_toto libraries; no direct untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "Argument parsing -> signer loading -> in_toto function calls for start/stop -> file signing and recording.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface for supply chain signing, securely handling passwords with getpass, delegating cryptography to trusted libraries, and performing file operations. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The flow is transparent, and the code adheres to standard security practices for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure CLI wrapper for in_toto's supply chain signing functions. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious activity is detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 is justified given its cryptographic handling but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
