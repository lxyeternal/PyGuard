  "purpose": "Provides a command line interface for in-toto supply chain verification, loading layout, verification keys, and invoking verification routines.",
  "sources": "Reads layout file, verification key files, GPG key IDs, and command line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Invokes verifylib.in_toto_verify with loaded data; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Loads layout and keys from files/arguments, then calls verification function; no network or external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for in-toto verification, parsing arguments, loading cryptographic keys, and invoking verification routines. It relies on trusted external libraries and performs no suspicious actions. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The broad exception handling is typical for CLI tools but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with its purpose as a supply chain verification tool, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, secure, and well-structured supply chain verification CLI tool. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
