{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the in-toto security framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports an exception class from securesystemslib.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input is processed; no data leakage or harmful actions occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are defined without dynamic data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns present. The code contains only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an exception base class and defines several custom exception classes, each representing specific error conditions relevant to the in-toto framework. These are standard practice for error handling and do not involve any data processing, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions serving as error indicators within a security framework. It poses no security risks, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity.",
