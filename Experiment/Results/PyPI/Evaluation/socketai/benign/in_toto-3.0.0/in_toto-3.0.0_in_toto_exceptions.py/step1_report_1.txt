  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a security framework related to in-toto, a supply chain security framework.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions, with no signs of unusual or malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an exception class from an external library and defines several custom exception classes inheriting from it. All classes are simple and serve as specific error types. There are no inputs, data manipulation, network activities, or other operations that could be malicious. The code appears to be part of a larger project for handling exceptions, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in a Python project. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
