  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a security framework.",
  "sources": "Import from securesystemslib.exceptions; class definitions with no input/output or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; classes are static definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base Error class and defines multiple specific exception subclasses, each with a docstring. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is purely for error signaling within a larger system. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are present. The structure is simple and standard for exception handling. The absence of suspicious patterns or malicious constructs indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes for a security-related Python project. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
