  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a security-related Python module.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as there are only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions extending a standard exception class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an exception class and defines multiple custom exception classes for specific error conditions. The classes are simple and do not contain any executable code or logic, serving solely for error categorization. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes for a security-focused Python module. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
