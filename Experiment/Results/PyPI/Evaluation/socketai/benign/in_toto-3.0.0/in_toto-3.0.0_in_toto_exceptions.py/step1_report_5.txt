{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a security or in-toto verification system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'securesystemslib.exceptions' and class definitions that extend Error.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines error classes without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard class definitions and does not perform any unusual operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an exception class and defines multiple subclasses of Error, each representing specific error types related to signature verification, layout expiration, rule verification, threshold issues, command return values, missing links, key type support, prefix errors, and invalid metadata. These are typical in a security-focused project. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation present. The code appears to be part of a well-structured error handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom error classes for a security verification framework. It shows no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
