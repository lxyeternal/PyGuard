  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely defining custom exception classes inheriting from an imported Error class.\n   - No external input/output, data processing, or network activity is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is straightforward class definitions serving as error indicators.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The summaries appropriately emphasize the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no active or potentially dangerous behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware = 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately assess the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive review and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception class definitions for a security framework, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores accurately reflect this assessment.",
