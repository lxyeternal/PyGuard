{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in a security-related library",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading operations present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations, no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code solely defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports an exception base class and defines multiple custom exception classes that extend it. All classes are simple and contain docstrings describing their purpose. There are no dynamic executions, input/output operations, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious activity. The code appears to be a standard part of a larger security library meant for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for a security library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this snippet.",
