{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for parsing, validating, and creating artifact rules used in the in-toto supply chain framework. Its purpose is to define and handle rules such as create, modify, delete, match, allow, disallow, and require for artifacts.",
  "sources": "The code reads rule definitions provided as lists of strings, typically representing rules in a specific syntax, as well as parameters for packing rules into list formats.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs parsed rule dictionaries and formatted rule lists; no untrusted data flows directly to sensitive system operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input rule list -> validation and parsing functions -> structured rule dictionary; then structured data can be packed into rule list format for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to strictly handle rule syntax validation and construction. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, network calls, or system modification commands. No evidence of obfuscated code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides parsing and packing functions for artifact rules in a structured, controlled manner, with input validation to ensure correct formats. It relies on external validation libraries and throws FormatError on invalid input. There are no operations that execute untrusted code, access external systems, or perform malicious actions. The functions are solely concerned with rule syntax validation and construction, with no indication of malicious intent. The lack of any network, file I/O, or environment variable access suggests a low risk of malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard, well-structured logic for rule handling, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for rule parsing and packing within the in-toto framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs validation and formatting of rules in a controlled manner, suitable for its purpose.",
