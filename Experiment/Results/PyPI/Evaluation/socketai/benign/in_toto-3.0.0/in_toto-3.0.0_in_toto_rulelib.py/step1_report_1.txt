{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to parse, validate, and create artifact rules for in-toto, used to specify expected artifacts in supply chain processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, such as rule lists, rule types, patterns, and rule data dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the construction of rule lists for in-toto steps and inspections, but there are no direct data leaks, system calls, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into validation functions and are used to construct rule dictionaries or lists, but there are no external system calls or untrusted data executions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual behavior are present. The code relies on standard string validation and formatting, with no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles parsing, validation, and packing of rules for in-toto artifact assertions. It uses secure format checks, raises exceptions for malformed input, and constructs rule representations for further processing. There are no signs of malicious logic such as network activity, file tampering, or credential handling. The functions serve a purely structural and validation purpose without any side effects or external interactions. Overall, the code appears safe and aligned with its documented purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, safe utility for rule handling within in-toto. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs validation and formatting tasks without any suspicious side effects.",
