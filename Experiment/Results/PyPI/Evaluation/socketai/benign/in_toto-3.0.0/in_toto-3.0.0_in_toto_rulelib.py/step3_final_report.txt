{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse, validate, and generate in-toto artifact rules, focusing on correctness and syntax compliance.",
  "sources": "Input rules as lists of strings, typically from user input or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Constructed rule dictionaries used downstream; no external system calls or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input rule list -> validation and parsing -> rule dictionary -> rule list for serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard validation, exception raising, and string handling.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles rule validation and construction with no external interactions, obfuscation, or malicious code. It validates input formats, raises exceptions on invalid data, and constructs rule representations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The validation logic is thorough, and the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for rule parsing and formatting within the in-toto framework. It poses no security risks or malware concerns based on its content and behavior.",
