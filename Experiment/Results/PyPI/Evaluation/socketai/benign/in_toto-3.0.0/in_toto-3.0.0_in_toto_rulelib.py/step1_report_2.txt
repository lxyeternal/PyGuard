{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions to parse and validate artifact rules and generate rule data structures for in-toto supply chain security policies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'rule', 'rule_type', 'pattern', 'dest_type', 'dest_prefix', 'dest_name', 'filename', and internal validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating rule dictionaries or lists, and exceptions raised for malformed inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and used to construct rule dictionaries or lists, which are then returned. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code mainly performs validation and structured data construction based on inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on rule definitions, ensuring correct format and allowed values. It converts rules between list and dictionary forms, ensuring consistency and correctness. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions strictly handle rule parsing and construction, with exception handling for malformed inputs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard validation and data-structuring utility for in-toto artifact rules, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured for rule management purposes, with thorough validation and no suspicious operations.",
