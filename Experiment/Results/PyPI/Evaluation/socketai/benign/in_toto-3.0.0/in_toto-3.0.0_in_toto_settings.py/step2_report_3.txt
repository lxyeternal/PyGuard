  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module.\n- It only defines static variables with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external communication.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The variables are typical for configuration purposes.\n- The comments clarify usage and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code defines static variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or sink issues.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; code is simple, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Correctly concludes no malicious or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1 — reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Also reasonable.\n\n### Report 3\n- Same as above, consistent analysis.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- Same reasoning; no anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- Same as others; static configuration with no dynamic or external data.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code is a static configuration module, with no malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and without malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores given:**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores?**  \n  No reason to assign higher scores; the code is benign.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward configuration file with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. The confidence remains at 1, as the analysis is clear and definitive.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This assessment assumes no hidden or dynamic code exists elsewhere; based solely on the provided code snippet, it is safe.",
