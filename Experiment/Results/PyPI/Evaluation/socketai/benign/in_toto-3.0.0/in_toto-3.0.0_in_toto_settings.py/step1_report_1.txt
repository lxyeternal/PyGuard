  "purpose": "Define default configuration settings for the in-toto package, including debug mode, artifact exclusion patterns, base path for artifacts, and command timeout.",
  "sources": "Constants and configuration variables defined directly in the script (DEBUG, ARTIFACT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS, ARTIFACT_BASE_PATH, LINK_CMD_EXEC_TIMEOUT).",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as system commands, network calls, or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward, with only comments and variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only static configuration definitions with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious logic are present. The comments clarify purpose and usage. The variables are typical configuration parameters. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module with no malicious or security-risk behavior. It serves to define default settings for the package. No security issues or malware detected.",
