  "purpose": "A central place to define default settings that can be used throughout the package.",
  "sources": "Static variable definitions: DEBUG, ARTIFACT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS, ARTIFACT_BASE_PATH, LINK_CMD_EXEC_TIMEOUT",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, output, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; static configuration variables without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with comments and no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module defining constants for a package. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, external communication, or obfuscation. Variables are simple, well-commented, and serve as default settings. No secrets, malicious logic, or risky behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no potential for malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely static configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
