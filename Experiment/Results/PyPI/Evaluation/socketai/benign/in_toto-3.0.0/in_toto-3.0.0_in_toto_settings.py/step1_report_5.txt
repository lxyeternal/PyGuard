{
  "purpose": "Define default configuration settings for the in-toto package, including debug mode, artifact exclusion patterns, base path, and execution timeout.",
  "sources": "Module initialization (import statements and constants), configuration variables (DEBUG, ARTIFACT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS, ARTIFACT_BASE_PATH, LINK_CMD_EXEC_TIMEOUT).",
  "sinks": "None of the variables directly handle untrusted input or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward configuration without obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes static configuration parameters for the in-toto framework. It contains no user input handling, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. Variables are hardcoded or defaulted, with comments explaining their purpose. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration module intended for setting default parameters. It shows no signs of malicious intent, no anomalies, and no security issues.",
