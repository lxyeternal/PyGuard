  "purpose": "Define default configuration settings for the in-toto package, including debug mode, artifact exclusion patterns, base path, and command timeout.",
  "sources": "Constants and configuration variables, including hardcoded strings, lists, and a None value.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive sinks; configuration is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward configuration setup with descriptive comments and no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets configuration parameters such as debug mode, exclusion patterns, base path, and timeout. All values are either boolean, list, or None, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external communication. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious code or obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. It only defines static default settings for the package.",
