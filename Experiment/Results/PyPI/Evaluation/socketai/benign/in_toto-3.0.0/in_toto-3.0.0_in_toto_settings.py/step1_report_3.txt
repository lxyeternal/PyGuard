  "purpose": "Define default configuration settings for the in-toto package, including debug mode, artifact exclude patterns, base path, and command timeout.",
  "sources": "Constants and module-level variables such as DEBUG, ARTIFACT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS, ARTIFACT_BASE_PATH, and LINK_CMD_EXEC_TIMEOUT.",
  "sinks": "Usage of configuration variables which influence runtime behavior, but no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables are set statically and used internally within the package; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic present. The code is straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines static configuration parameters with no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or network activity. It is standard for a settings module, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a static configuration setup with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured settings file.",
