  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module defining constants for a package.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, external data, or execution of untrusted code.\n- All variables are static, with descriptive comments.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The code is well-structured and standard for a settings file.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies static configuration variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or sinks involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; straightforward code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- Same observations as Report 1, with similar reasoning.\n- No external input, no malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- Same as above, consistent with previous findings.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on static configuration.\n- No dynamic or external data handling.\n- Scores align.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- Same conclusion: static configuration, no malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Scores\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification\n\n- The code is a simple configuration file with no dynamic code, input handling, or external communication.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a static configuration module with no malicious or risky behavior. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scoring is reasonable, and there are no discrepancies or overlooked issues. The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security concerns.",
