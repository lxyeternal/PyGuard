  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward static configuration module.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, external data, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, secrets, or anomalies are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence score of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n- The code consists solely of variable definitions and comments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports accurately reflect the code's nature: static configuration with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent, and the conclusions are justified given the code.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The security risk is also 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Correctly set to 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external commands, handling untrusted input, or including obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  Correctly 0. The code is clear, straightforward, and well-commented.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Correctly 0. Given the static nature and lack of vulnerabilities, this is appropriate.\n\n- **Any assumptions or claims?**  \n  The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis, which is reasonable. No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made, and none are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a simple configuration file with no dynamic or risky components.\n- The scores align with the analysis.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, standard configuration, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further action needed. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
