  "purpose": "Defines default configuration settings for the in-toto package, including debug mode, artifact exclude patterns, base path, and execution timeout.",
  "sources": "Constant variables set within the settings.py file (DEBUG, ARTIFACT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS, ARTIFACT_BASE_PATH, LINK_CMD_EXEC_TIMEOUT). No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Configuration variables that influence package behavior, particularly related to artifact handling and command execution timeout. No untrusted data is being used as a sink.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. The code consists of straightforward configuration assignments with descriptive comments. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of variable assignments and comments describing their purpose. It does not include any external input handling, network operations, or execution of untrusted code. The variables are standard configuration parameters for the package. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static configuration file with no indication of malicious behavior or security threats. It simply defines default settings for the in-toto package, aligned with its documented purpose.",
