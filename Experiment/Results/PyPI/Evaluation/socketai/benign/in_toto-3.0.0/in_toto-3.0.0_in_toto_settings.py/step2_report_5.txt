  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module, defining constants and default settings.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, external data, or system calls are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or secrets.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n\n- The code matches the description: static variable assignments, comments, no external input or execution.\n- No issues are present in the code snippets.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign configuration.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is static, simple, and free of malicious patterns.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly reflecting no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores\n\n- The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is just static configuration.\n- No suspicious behaviors or patterns are present.\n- The reports correctly conclude no security issues or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Metric            | Score |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Malware           | 0       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       |\n| Security Risk     | 0       |\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static configuration module.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- No security vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary. The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**Malware: 0**  \n**Obfuscated: 0**  \n**Risk: 0**  \n\nThe code poses no security threat.",
