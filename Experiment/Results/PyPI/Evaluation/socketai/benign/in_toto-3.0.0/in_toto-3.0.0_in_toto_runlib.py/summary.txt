  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured supply chain utility library with no malicious intent or behavior. It performs artifact management, command execution, and cryptographic signing/verifying using standard practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to external environment dependencies. No further action is necessary."
