  "purpose": "Minimal setup script importing in_toto.log and defining version",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'import in_toto.log'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior; straightforward code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a logging component and sets a version string. It contains only comments, an import, and a version assignment, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import assumes 'in_toto.log' is a trusted internal module. No data handling, network activity, or secrets are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward setup module for logging configuration in the in_toto project. It poses no security risks or malicious intent, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
