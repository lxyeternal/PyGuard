  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only standard import and module-level comments, no suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comments, a license identifier, an import statement for a presumably local or trusted in_toto.log module, and setting a version string. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors. The import appears standard, and there are no dynamic executions or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely responsible for importing a logging module and setting a version. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
