  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; module only imports and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard import and comment structure. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logging module from in_toto, which is a common practice for setting up logging. The version string is hardcoded but not malicious. No input handling, no dynamic execution, no network activity, or obfuscated code. The comments indicate licensing and purpose, typical for open-source modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, benign setup code for logging in the in_toto package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
