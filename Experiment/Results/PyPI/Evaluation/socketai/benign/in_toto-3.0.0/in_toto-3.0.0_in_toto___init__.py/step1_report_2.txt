  "purpose": "Configure base logger for in_toto, a supply chain security tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'import in_toto.log'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only imports a module and sets a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version assignment. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logging module 'in_toto.log' which is expected for configuration purposes. It defines a version string for the package. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a simple initialization snippet for logging setup without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a basic configuration setup for in_toto with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
