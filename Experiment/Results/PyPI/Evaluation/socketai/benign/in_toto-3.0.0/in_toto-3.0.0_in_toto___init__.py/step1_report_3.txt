  "purpose": "Configure base logger for in_toto project and declare version information.",
  "sources": "Import statement: import in_toto.log",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code does not process data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard license comments, version declaration, and simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing comments, a docstring explaining logger configuration, an import of a logging module, and a version declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious constructs. The import is a standard practice for logging configuration, and no user input, data transmission, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign module setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up logging for the in_toto project.",
