{
  "purpose": "Provides command line interface for signing and verifying in-toto link or layout metadata using local keys, GPG, or both.",
  "sources": "Reads input file path (--file), key files (--key), GPG key IDs (--gpg), and password prompts (via getpass).",
  "sinks": "Dumps signed metadata to specified output (--output) or to default filenames; loads metadata from disk; exports GPG pubkeys.",
  "flows": "Input file is loaded, metadata is signed or verified based on arguments, then signed metadata is dumped to disk or verification results logged.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling, but does not contain suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code detected. Logging info appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic signing and verification operations using in-toto models, secures signatures via local keys or GPG, and manages files accordingly. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms is present. Error handling is broad but typical for such CLI tools. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are identified beyond normal cryptographic practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script implements legitimate signing and verification functionality for in-toto metadata. No malicious intent or malware indicators are detected. It adheres to expected security practices for key handling, file I/O, and external GPG interactions. Overall, the code appears safe and free of malicious behavior.",
