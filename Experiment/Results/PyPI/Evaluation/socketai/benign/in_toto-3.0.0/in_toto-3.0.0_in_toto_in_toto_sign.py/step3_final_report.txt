  "purpose": "CLI utility for signing and verifying in-toto link or layout metadata, utilizing cryptographic keys and GPG, to facilitate supply chain security operations.",
  "sources": "Reads key files (--key), GPG key IDs (--gpg), input metadata files (--file), and user password prompts (getpass).",
  "sinks": "Outputs signed or verified metadata files, logs informational and error messages, and interacts with external cryptographic libraries.",
  "flows": "Loads metadata from disk -> signs or verifies using keys or GPG -> outputs results to specified files or defaults -> logs process details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors, and no unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic signing and verification operations for in-toto metadata, with proper key handling, user prompts, and file management. It employs external libraries appropriately, with broad exception handling typical for CLI tools. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The security measures, such as password prompts and key loading, follow best practices. The absence of network activity or hidden code further supports its legitimacy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented CLI utility for cryptographic signing and verification of supply chain metadata. It contains no malicious or sabotage-related behavior, and its security risk is minimal. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
