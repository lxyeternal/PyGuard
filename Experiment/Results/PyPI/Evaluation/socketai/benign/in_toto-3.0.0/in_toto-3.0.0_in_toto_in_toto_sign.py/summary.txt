  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented CLI utility for cryptographic signing and verification of supply chain metadata. It contains no malicious or sabotage-related behavior, and its security risk is minimal. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are justified and appropriate."
