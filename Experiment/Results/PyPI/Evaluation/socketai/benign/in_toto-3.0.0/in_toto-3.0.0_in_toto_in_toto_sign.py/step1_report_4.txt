  "purpose": "Provides command line interface to sign and verify in-toto link or layout metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata files from disk, reads key files from disk, reads GPG key IDs from command line arguments, and prompts for passwords.",
  "sinks": "Calls functions to create signatures, verify signatures, load metadata, and dump signed metadata to disk.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata and key data from disk -> signs or verifies signatures -> outputs signed metadata to disk",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code; prompts for password only when necessary; uses standard libraries; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles signing and verification of in-toto metadata files via cryptographic keys. It uses standard libraries and follows expected patterns for cryptographic signing and signature verification. It includes GPG integration, allowing signing with GPG keys and exporting GPG public keys. It prompts securely for passwords when needed. No code for malicious data exfiltration, system manipulation, or stealthy backdoors was identified. No anomalies in code flow or logic, and no suspicious network activity or code injection present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool for signing and verifying in-toto metadata. It contains no malware or malicious behavior. It is focused on cryptographic operations and file handling, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious code. The overall security risk is low.",
