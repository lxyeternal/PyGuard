{
  "purpose": "The code is a test case to verify the 'callable metadata' of the IOBluetoothUI module, ensuring certain attributes are properly accessible and sane.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'IOBluetoothUI' module and calls 'assertCallableMetadataIsSane' on it.",
  "sinks": "The code does not interact with untrusted input, perform data output, or call external systems.",
  "flows": "The code calls a testing method on the imported module to validate its callable attributes; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test that imports a module and validates its callable metadata via an existing test utility method. No user input, network communication, or system modification occurs. The excluded attributes list appears to be for testing specific known attributes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a benign test case to validate module attributes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
