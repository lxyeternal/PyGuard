  "purpose": "Setup and import of the IOBluetoothUI framework for use within a Python environment.",
  "sources": "import sys, IOBluetooth, objc, _metadata from current package",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network or file writes, no sensitive data handling",
  "flows": "Import statements → createFrameworkDirAndGetattr call → setting __dir__ and __getattr__ → deletion of module from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr; deletion of internal module from sys.modules; no docstrings or explicit security checks",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically creates framework access functions for IOBluetoothUI, which involves reflection and module manipulation. The _setup() function imports necessary modules, constructs framework directory and attribute functions, assigns them to globals, and deletes an internal metadata module from sys.modules. The removal of _metadata and the dynamic nature of the attribute functions could be exploited if maliciously altered, but in this context, they serve legitimate purposes related to framework setup. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is primarily boilerplate for framework access, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup routine for interfacing with an Apple framework via PyObjC, with no malicious behavior detected. The use of dynamic attribute creation is typical for such bindings and does not indicate malicious intent.",
