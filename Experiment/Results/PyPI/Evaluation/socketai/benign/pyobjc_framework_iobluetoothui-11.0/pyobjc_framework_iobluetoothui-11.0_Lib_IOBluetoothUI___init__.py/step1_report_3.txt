  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python wrapper for the IOBluetoothUI framework by setting up dynamic attribute access and framework loading.",
  "sources": "import sys, IOBluetooth, objc, and _metadata; calls to objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr()",
  "sinks": "globals()['__dir__'] and globals()['__getattr__'] assignments, deletion of sys.modules entry",
  "flows": "import statements -> createFrameworkDirAndGetattr() -> assign to globals() -> delete sys.modules entry",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation via createFrameworkDirAndGetattr() is standard for such wrappers but can be complex. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident. The deletion of a module from sys.modules might be unusual but appears to be for cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, then calls objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr() to dynamically create directory and attribute getter functions for the IOBluetoothUI framework. It assigns these functions to global variables '__dir__' and '__getattr__', enabling dynamic attribute access. It then deletes an internal module '_metadata' from sys.modules to possibly prevent reuse or reduce footprint. The use of dynamic attribute creation is typical for Python bindings of Objective-C frameworks; no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The removal of sys.modules entry is unusual but likely benign, aimed at cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python framework wrapper initialization, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It uses dynamic attribute creation typical for such bindings. No security risks or malware are detected.",
