  "purpose": "Setup and interface with the macOS IOBluetoothUI framework via dynamic attribute creation for Python bindings.",
  "sources": "Importing sys, IOBluetooth, objc modules; calling objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to generate framework access functions.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of generated functions to globals (__dir__, __getattr__); deletion of _metadata from sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> create framework access functions -> assign to globals -> delete internal module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation and deletion of internal modules, which could be suspicious but are standard in framework bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward boilerplate for setting up Python bindings to a system framework, involving standard dynamic attribute creation and cleanup. No network activity, data handling, or hardcoded secrets are present. The use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr and sys.modules manipulation is typical for such bindings. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate framework setup code with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
