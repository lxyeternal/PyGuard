  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a dynamic setup routine for the IOBluetoothUI framework using objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr.\n- The code involves importing modules, creating framework access functions dynamically, assigning them to globals, and deleting an internal module from sys.modules.\n- No report indicates any actual data handling, network activity, or system modifications beyond framework setup.\n- The use of dynamic attribute creation and module manipulation is typical for bridging Python with Objective-C frameworks.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is reported or evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code performs standard framework setup, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities directly observable.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or security flaws?**  \n  None are apparent. The deletion of `_metadata` from `sys.modules` is unusual but likely for cleanup, not malicious.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malware behavior is detected or suggested.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign `0`. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is low. Given the nature of the code, this seems reasonable.\n\n- **Purpose of scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are well below that threshold.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code is a boilerplate for framework setup, with no malicious intent.\n- Dynamic attribute creation and module deletion are common in such wrappers.\n- No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.\n\n### Consistency check:\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the uniformity of the reports and their findings, I agree with their assessments. The code is standard framework setup code, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to the dynamic nature which could be misused if misconfigured, but not in this case)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is legitimate, standard boilerplate for macOS framework access, with no security concerns or malware. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed. Continue monitoring for any future modifications, but based on current analysis, the code is safe.",
