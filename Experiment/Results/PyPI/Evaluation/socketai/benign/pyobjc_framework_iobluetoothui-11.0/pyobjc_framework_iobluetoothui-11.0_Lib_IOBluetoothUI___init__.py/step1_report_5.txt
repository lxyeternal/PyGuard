{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python wrapper for the IOBluetoothUI framework on macOS, setting up dynamic attribute and directory functions for framework access.",
  "sources": "Imports modules sys, IOBluetooth, objc, and a local _metadata; calls objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to set up framework access.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __dir__ and __getattr__ functions to globals, deletion of a module from sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Imports -> createFrameworkDirAndGetattr -> setting globals for __dir__ and __getattr__ -> deleting sys.modules entry.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic attribute creation and modifies the global namespace, which can be suspicious if used maliciously, but here it appears to be standard framework setup. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup for interfacing with a system framework, dynamically creating framework access functions and cleaning up sys.modules. It does not perform any network activity, data collection, or system modifications. The use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr is typical for such bindings, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard framework initialization script for macOS's IOBluetoothUI, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It appears to be a legitimate setup routine for system framework access.",
