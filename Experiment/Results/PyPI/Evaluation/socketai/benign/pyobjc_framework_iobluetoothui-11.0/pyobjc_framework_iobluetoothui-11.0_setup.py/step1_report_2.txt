  "purpose": "Set up and configure the Python package 'pyobjc-framework-IOBluetoothUI' for macOS, wrapping the IOBluetoothUI framework.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine current directory, importing setup from pyobjc_setup, static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The setup process appears standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup operations, such as adjusting sys.path, importing setup, defining version, and calling setup() with package details and dependencies. There are no input handling, network operations, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. The code is straightforward and conforms to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for package distribution scripts.",
