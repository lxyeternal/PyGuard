  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python setup script for packaging a macOS framework wrapper. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no suspicious behaviors, no external data processing, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code matches the description in all reports. No anomalies, no hidden code, no external data handling.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** No evident security issues.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or input validation, but that is typical for a setup script.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- The dependencies are specified with version constraints, which is standard.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; the script is a benign package setup.\n\n### Final assessment:\n**I agree with the provided scores.** The code is standard, benign, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**In conclusion,** this code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in all reports are justified and should remain as-is.",
