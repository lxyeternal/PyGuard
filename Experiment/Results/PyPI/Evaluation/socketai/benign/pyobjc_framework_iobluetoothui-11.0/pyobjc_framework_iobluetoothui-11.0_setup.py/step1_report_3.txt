  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that provides wrappers for the IOBluetoothUI framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information from __file__, the current working directory, and the setup configuration data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data is used in a manner that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the script's variables and environment inputs to the setup configuration, which is standard for package setup; no malicious or unusual data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and calls a setup function with package configuration details. The setup parameters follow conventional patterns for Python packaging. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. No anomalies or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script for macOS Bluetooth UI wrappers. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
