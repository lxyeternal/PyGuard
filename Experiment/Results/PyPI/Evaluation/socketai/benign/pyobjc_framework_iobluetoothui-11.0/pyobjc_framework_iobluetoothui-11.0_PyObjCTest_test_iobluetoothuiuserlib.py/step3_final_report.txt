  "purpose": "Static verification of IOBluetoothUI module interface, constants, and function references.",
  "sources": "Module attribute references and function names, no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assertions only, no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; straightforward assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static unit tests verifying types, constants, and function presence in the IOBluetoothUI module. It does not perform data processing, network communication, or system modifications. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The assertions are static and only verify interface correctness. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The minimal security risk and malware scores are justified, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface verification test suite with no malicious or security concerns. The supply chain security risk is negligible, and the scores are appropriate.",
