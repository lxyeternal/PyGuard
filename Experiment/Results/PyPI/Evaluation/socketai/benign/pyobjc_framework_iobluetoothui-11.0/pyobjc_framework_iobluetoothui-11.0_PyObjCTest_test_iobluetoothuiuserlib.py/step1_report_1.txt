  "purpose": "Unit tests for IOBluetoothUI module, verifying type, constant, and function definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function definitions within the test class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external inputs; test assertions do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; standard test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a Bluetooth UI module, then defines a test class with methods to verify types, constants, and functions. The code only contains assertions and references to module attributes and functions, with no dynamic execution, data manipulation, or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or anomalous code patterns. The functions are simply referenced, not invoked with parameters, and no network or system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for verifying module attributes and functions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
