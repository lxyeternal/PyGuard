  "purpose": "To create a Python mapping for the ServerNotification framework by dynamically loading the Objective-C module using objc.ObjCLazyModule.",
  "sources": "import sys, import Foundation, import objc, import _metadata from ServerNotification",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.modules to insert a lazy-loaded module, deleting sys.modules entry for _metadata",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> Setting sys.modules['ServerNotification'] to lazy module -> Deleting sys.modules['ServerNotification._metadata']",
  "anomalies": "The code deletes an entry ('ServerNotification._metadata') from sys.modules after importing it, which could potentially be used to hide malicious modifications or interfere with module loading.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a lazy module import for the ServerNotification framework via objc.ObjCLazyModule. It imports necessary modules and metadata, registers the module in sys.modules, and then deletes the metadata entry from sys.modules. The deletion of the metadata module could be suspicious if used maliciously to hide tampering or to prevent detection of modifications. However, this pattern could also be standard for certain dynamic loading scenarios. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or malicious code constructs are evident. The code itself appears to be a standard wrapper for framework loading, with a potentially suspicious side effect in deleting the metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical dynamic framework loader with the minor anomaly of deleting the metadata module from sys.modules. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. The deletion step could be used maliciously to obscure module contents, but this is context-dependent and not definitive from this snippet alone.",
