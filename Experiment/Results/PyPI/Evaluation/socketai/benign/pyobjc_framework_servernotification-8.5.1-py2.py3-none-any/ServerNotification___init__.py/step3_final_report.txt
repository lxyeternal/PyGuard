{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads the macOS ServerNotification framework into Python using objc.ObjCLazyModule, enabling access to Objective-C classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, Foundation, objc, and the _metadata attribute from ServerNotification; the framework path specified in objc.pathForFramework.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; no untrusted data handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and sets up a lazy module, then deletes the _metadata entry from sys.modules; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Deletion of '_metadata' from sys.modules after import, which could be used to hide module details or interfere with module inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard framework loading via objc.ObjCLazyModule, a common pattern for bridging Objective-C frameworks into Python. The deletion of '_metadata' from sys.modules is a minor anomaly that could be exploited to hide modifications but is often used to prevent re-import or cleanup. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The code does not handle user input, network data, or perform any insecure operations. The overall structure and purpose are legitimate and typical for system framework bindings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and standard implementation for loading a macOS system framework into Python. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected. The minor sys.modules manipulation is a common pattern in such wrappers and does not indicate malicious intent in this context.",
