It then removes the '_metadata' entry from sys.modules, possibly to hide the metadata or prevent re-import. The code does not contain any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions.

No external data input or untrusted sources are directly involved, reducing the likelihood of supply chain attacks within this code segment.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code's purpose is to load and expose the ServerNotification framework dynamically, which is a standard practice for macOS Python bindings. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.
