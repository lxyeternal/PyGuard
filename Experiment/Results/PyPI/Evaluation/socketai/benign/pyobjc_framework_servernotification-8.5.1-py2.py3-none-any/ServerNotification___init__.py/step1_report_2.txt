{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python mapping for the ServerNotification framework, dynamically loading and exposing Objective-C classes and metadata for use within Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name 'ServerNotification' from sys.modules, imports Foundation and objc modules, and accesses _metadata from ServerNotification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or exposed externally.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, creating a lazy module loader for ServerNotification, and then removing the _metadata entry from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic module creation via ObjCLazyModule and manipulates sys.modules, which could be considered advanced or unusual. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are evident. The use of lazy loading is not inherently suspicious but warrants caution if the framework is untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically loads a macOS system framework using objc.ObjCLazyModule, which is a standard technique for bridging Objective-C frameworks into Python. It then cleans up by deleting a metadata entry from sys.modules. The code does not contain any user input handling, network activity, or data manipulation. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The only notable aspect is dynamic module loading and sys.modules manipulation, which are common in system integration scripts but can be exploited in malicious contexts if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python wrapper for a macOS system framework, designed to facilitate access to system notification functionalities. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. The use of dynamic module loading and metadata management is typical for such wrappers and does not pose a security risk in this context.",
