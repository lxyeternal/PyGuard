  "purpose": "To dynamically load the ServerNotification framework into Python using objc's ObjCLazyModule for interoperability with Objective-C code on macOS.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, Foundation, objc, and _metadata; the framework path /System/Library/Frameworks/ServerNotification.framework; _metadata.__dict__ for module metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external data leakage are present; no network or file operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Import and setup of the module, dynamically loading the framework and deleting metadata from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of objc.ObjCLazyModule to load a system framework is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual operations are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up a lazy loading of the ServerNotification framework using objc, and cleans up the sys.modules namespace by removing _metadata. All operations are typical for bridging Objective-C frameworks in Python. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code relies on system framework paths and standard Python and Objective-C mechanisms without suspicious modifications or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for loading an Apple system framework into Python via objc. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate framework interoperability, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
