  "purpose": "To create a Python mapping for the ServerNotification framework using Objective-C bridging, enabling Python code to interact with macOS's ServerNotification framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, Foundation, objc, and _metadata; module creation via objc.ObjCLazyModule",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Import modules → create lazy module → delete _metadata from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, then sets up a lazy loading of the ServerNotification framework through objc.ObjCLazyModule, which defers loading until needed. It assigns the module to sys.modules, then removes _metadata from sys.modules. All actions are typical for bridging Objective-C frameworks in Python. No data inputs, sinks, or flows indicate malicious activity. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for framework access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python binding setup for the ServerNotification framework with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply facilitates access to system frameworks without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
