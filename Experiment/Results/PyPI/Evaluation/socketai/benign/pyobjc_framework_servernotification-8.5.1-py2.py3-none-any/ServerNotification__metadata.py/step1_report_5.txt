{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up platform-specific functions and register metadata for Objective-C selectors, likely used for interfacing with Objective-C frameworks or applications.",
  "sources": "Reads system architecture via 'sys.maxsize' and 'objc.arch', and imports 'objc' and 'sys' modules.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'objc.registerMetaDataForSelector' with specific parameters; potentially modifies Objective-C runtime behavior.",
  "flows": "Reads system architecture -> Defines functions based on architecture -> Registers Objective-C selector metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of 'objc' and runtime metadata registration is typical for Objective-C integration, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines platform-dependent functions and registers metadata for an Objective-C selector related to 'addObserver:selector:name:object:'. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The use of 'objc' to modify metadata is typical in applications that integrate with Objective-C or macOS/iOS frameworks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. The registration of metadata is controlled and limited to a specific method signature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be part of a setup or configuration routine for Objective-C interoperation. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected in this fragment.",
