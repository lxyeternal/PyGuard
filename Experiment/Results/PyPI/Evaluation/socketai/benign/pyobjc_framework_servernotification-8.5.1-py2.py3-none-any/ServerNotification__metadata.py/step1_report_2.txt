{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a generated metadata setup script for Objective-C interoperability, defining platform-specific functions and registering metadata for Objective-C selectors.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), and registers metadata via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "sinks": "The metadata registration is a potential sink where untrusted or manipulated data could affect method signatures or behavior, but it is used here in a controlled manner.",
  "flows": "System info (platform architecture) influences function definitions, which then may influence metadata registration; the registration call is the key sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and appears to be auto-generated setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code determines platform-specific behavior via sys.maxsize and objc.arch, then defines helper functions accordingly. It then registers Objective-C method metadata using objc.registerMetaDataForSelector. The process appears to be standard setup for Objective-C interoperability, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. No external inputs are processed in a harmful manner. The code is minimal, structured, and typical of auto-generated metadata scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, auto-generated Objective-C metadata registration setup with no malicious or security-related concerns. It operates within the expected bounds of such scripts, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
