{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be involved in setting up Objective-C metadata and conditional function definitions based on system architecture and platform specifics.",
  "sources": "Reading system properties (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), importing modules (objc, sys), and registering metadata with objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "sinks": "Calling objc.registerMetaDataForSelector with specific selector and argument metadata.",
  "flows": "System properties and imports → conditional function definitions → metadata registration via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically defines functions based on architecture and platform, which could be used for obfuscation, but no obvious malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'objc' and 'sys' modules, checks system architecture via 'sys.maxsize' and 'objc.arch', then defines helper functions based on these conditions. It initializes dictionaries for constants and enums, updates a miscellaneous dictionary, and then registers metadata for an Objective-C selector 'addObserver:selector:name:object:' on 'NSServerNotificationCenter'. The registration process involves setting argument types. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no sinks (like network or file operations) are present. The code appears to be configuring metadata for Objective-C runtime interactions, possibly for a plugin or extension system. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command execution, or stealth behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs platform-specific setup for Objective-C method metadata registration. It does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it contain malware or security risks. The dynamic function definitions based on architecture are typical for cross-platform Objective-C code handling.",
