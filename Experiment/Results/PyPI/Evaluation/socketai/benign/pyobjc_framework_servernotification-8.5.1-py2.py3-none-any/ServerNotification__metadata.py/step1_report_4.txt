{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set platform-specific functions and register metadata for Objective-C selectors, likely as part of an Objective-C bridge or interface.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via sys.maxsize and objc.arch; retrieves data related to Objective-C method registration.",
  "sinks": "Calls to objc.registerMetaDataForSelector which could potentially register or modify method metadata.",
  "flows": "sys.maxsize and objc.arch determine function selection -> registerMetaDataForSelector registers method metadata based on fixed data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic function selection based on system architecture, and registration of Objective-C selector metadata; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data; no external data sources or user input detected.",
  "analysis": "The code detects system architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit and ARM64 vs others) to assign functions. It then registers Objective-C method metadata for 'addObserver:selector:name:object:' in 'NSServerNotificationCenter'. No external inputs, no network calls, and no obfuscated code are present. The registration process seems standard for Objective-C interop. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The code is straightforward and seems to serve a legitimate purpose related to Objective-C runtime setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for Objective-C runtime metadata registration. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
