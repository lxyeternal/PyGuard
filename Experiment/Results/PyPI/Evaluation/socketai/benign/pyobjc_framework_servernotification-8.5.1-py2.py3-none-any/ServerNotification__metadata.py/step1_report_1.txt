{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be generated by a metadata tool for Objective-C bindings, possibly for configuring method metadata and selectors in an Objective-C runtime environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), imports modules (objc, sys), and registers metadata via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "sinks": "The registration call to objc.registerMetaDataForSelector with specific arguments, which could be used to manipulate method metadata or behavior at runtime.",
  "flows": "The code flow reads system architecture and environment variables, then registers method metadata for a specific Objective-C selector related to NSServerNotificationCenter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code appears standard for Objective-C runtime metadata setup, with no suspicious code or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically determines system architecture and registers metadata for an Objective-C selector related to NSServerNotificationCenter. It conditionally defines functions based on system architecture and architecture type. The purpose seems to be configuring method metadata, which is typical in Objective-C runtime extensions. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. The code does not include obfuscated or encrypted parts, nor does it perform any suspicious actions beyond runtime metadata registration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Objective-C runtime setup script generated by a metadata tool. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be legitimate configuration code for Objective-C method metadata.",
