{
  "purpose": "This code sets up Objective-C runtime metadata for the selector 'addObserver:selector:name:object:' on NSServerNotificationCenter, based on system architecture and platform.",
  "sources": "Reads system architecture info via sys.maxsize and objc.arch; imports objc and sys modules.",
  "sinks": "Registers method metadata via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector, which modifies runtime method info.",
  "flows": "Source data (system info) influences platform-specific function definitions; registration call is the key sink.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated Objective-C runtime setup code. It conditionally defines functions based on system architecture and platform, then registers method metadata for a specific selector. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The registration modifies runtime method info in a controlled manner, typical in Objective-C applications. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward and standard for Objective-C interoperability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard Objective-C runtime metadata registration code with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
