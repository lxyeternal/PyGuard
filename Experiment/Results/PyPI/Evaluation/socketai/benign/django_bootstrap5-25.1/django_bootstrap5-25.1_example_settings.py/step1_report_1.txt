  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django web application, including paths, database, middleware, installed apps, and security settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file system paths, and static configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "File system (for static/media files), database, email handlers (for logging errors).",
  "flows": "Configuration values are used throughout the application for paths, security, and operational settings; no untrusted input flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials beyond the default SECRET_KEY, which is a common practice but could be a target if exposed. The SECRET_KEY is a static string, but that alone isn't malicious. No hardcoded secrets, passwords, or tokens are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected. No network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module containing typical configuration parameters. Paths are constructed using os.path functions, avoiding hardcoded sensitive info. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded but is a typical placeholder; in a real deployment, this should be kept secret. The database is local SQLite, which is common for development but not secure for production. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Logging is configured to email admins on errors, which is standard practice. No external inputs are used that could lead to injection or data leaks. No obfuscated or malicious scripts are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django configuration file with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. It mainly sets up paths, database, middleware, apps, and logging, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
