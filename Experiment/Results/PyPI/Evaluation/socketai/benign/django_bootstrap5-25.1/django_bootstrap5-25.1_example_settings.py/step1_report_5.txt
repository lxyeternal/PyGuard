  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django web application, including database, static/media files, middleware, templates, installed apps, and security settings.",
  "sources": "None in the code that reads untrusted input directly; the code primarily sets static configuration values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code handles internal configuration without external data processing.",
  "flows": "The code does not define data flow paths involving untrusted sources or sensitive sinks; it mainly establishes app configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets other than the SECRET_KEY, which is a static string but commonly stored in code; no suspicious code or unusual behaviors detected. The static SECRET_KEY is a typical Django setting but should be kept secret in production. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious imports or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module with typical configurations for database, static/media files, middleware, installed apps, and logging. It includes the SECRET_KEY directly in code, which is common but should be managed securely in production. No user input handling or external data processing is present that could lead to vulnerabilities. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The configuration appears legitimate and typical for a Django project.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Django configuration file with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies. The code is clear and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications.",
