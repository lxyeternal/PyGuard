  "purpose": "Configuration script for a Django web application, setting up project paths, database, middleware, templates, static files, and other settings.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, file system paths, and Django settings such as SECRET_KEY and static/media paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses Django's logging and error handling, as well as inserting BOOTSTRAP5_FOLDER into sys.path.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> sets paths -> inserts custom folder into sys.path -> loads settings (database, security, templates, static files, middleware) -> configures logging -> finalizes settings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets aside from SECRET_KEY, which is a fixed string; no suspicious network activity or external calls. Path insertion into sys.path is typical for custom modules, but could potentially be used maliciously if BOOTSTRAP5_FOLDER points to a malicious location. The SECRET_KEY is static, which is insecure but not malicious. DEBUG is enabled, which could expose sensitive info if deployed in production.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module with no apparent malicious payloads. It dynamically adjusts the Python path to include a bootstrap folder, which might be benign or malicious depending on the folder's origin. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is insecure but not malicious per se. No code injections, data leaks, or network communications are evident. The configuration is typical for Django projects, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate Django configuration file with no malicious behavior detected. The main concern is the static SECRET_KEY and DEBUG mode being active, which are security misconfigurations but not malware. There is no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution.",
