  "purpose": "Standard Django settings configuration for a web application, primarily for development purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (none explicitly), static configuration values, and includes external path modification for BOOTSTRAP5_FOLDER.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration and import paths are used without external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; inclusion of BOOTSTRAP5_FOLDER in sys.path is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of BOOTSTRAP5_FOLDER in sys.path could be suspicious if the folder is malicious, but no evidence supports this. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, and DEBUG=True is insecure for production, but these are common in development environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module with static configuration values. No dynamic or external data influences security-sensitive parts. The inclusion of an external folder in sys.path warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. The SECRET_KEY is static, and DEBUG mode is enabled, which are security concerns but not malicious behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or supply chain compromise; the main issues are insecure configuration settings suitable for development but not production.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The primary security risks are related to insecure configuration (hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG=True), which should be addressed for deployment but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
