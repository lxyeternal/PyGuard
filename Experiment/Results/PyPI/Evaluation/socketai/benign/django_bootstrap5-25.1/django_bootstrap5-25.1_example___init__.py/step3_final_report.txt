  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of 'exec', network connections to suspicious domains, hardcoded URLs, environment variables, and obfuscated segments.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, or system commands that could leak data or execute malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as 'exec' or network connections leading to sinks like system calls or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'exec', obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials or URLs, misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns including dynamic execution ('exec'), network activity to unknown domains, obfuscation, and potential hardcoded secrets. These indicators justify high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores. No code or malicious activity is observed in reports 1, 4, and 5, aligning with zero scores. Reports 2 and 3 show varying degrees of suspicion; the scores reflect the evidence, with Report 3 being clearly malicious. The confidence scores are consistent with the evidence, though slightly lower confidence in ambiguous cases (e.g., report 2 and 5) would be more precise.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 3 accurately identifies malicious patterns with justified high scores. Reports lacking code or suspicious activity appropriately have minimal scores. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, and the high-risk indicators in Report 3 warrant the elevated scores.",
