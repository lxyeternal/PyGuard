  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No actual malicious code or behavior; the only concern is the 'xss_field' label containing a simulated XSS payload.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The label with potential XSS content is a concern if rendered unsanitized, but as code, it's just a string. No execution or injection occurs here.\n- **Conclusion:** The score of 0.2 for security risk seems appropriate, and malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with no actual malicious activity; 'xss_field' label contains a potential XSS vector.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning applies; the label is a concern if not escaped in templates but is not malicious by itself.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, no malicious code; 'xss_field' has a static value with no embedded scripts or event handlers.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The 'secret' field is a hardcoded value, but not malicious; 'clean' methods raise validation errors intentionally.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** The 'xss_field' label contains an onmouseover event with an alert, which could be exploited if rendered unsanitized.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The label's content is potentially dangerous if not escaped, but the code itself does not execute or inject code.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0.2 is justified; malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, with 'xss_field' label containing a script snippet that could lead to XSS if not sanitized.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No actual attack or code execution, just a vector.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 due to potential XSS vector in labels, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor potential for XSS if labels are rendered unsanitized, but no actual exploit.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis. The only minor concern is the 'xss_field' label containing potentially dangerous content, but in the context of form definitions, it does not constitute an active security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary statement:**  \nThe code is primarily standard Django form definitions with some fields containing labels that could pose XSS risks if rendered without proper sanitization. No malware, obfuscation, or active vulnerabilities are present. The current scores reflect this accurately.",
