  "purpose": "Assess open-source Django form code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, focusing on potential supply chain vulnerabilities and malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Labels containing potential XSS payloads, static initial values, and validation error raises; no external data sources or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "sinks": "Rendering of form labels with embedded scripts or event handlers that could lead to XSS if not sanitized; no data leaks or external calls identified.",
  "flows": "Label strings with embedded scripts are potential vectors if rendered unsanitized; no actual code execution or data flow to external systems observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of labels with inline JavaScript-like content and validation errors for UI testing; no obfuscation or malicious code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Django forms with various widgets and fields, including labels containing strings that could be exploited for XSS if not properly escaped during template rendering. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The 'clean' methods raise validation errors for UI demonstration, not malicious purposes. The 'secret' field's static initial value is not sensitive. Overall, the code is straightforward, with potential XSS vectors limited to label content, which is a common concern in form rendering. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the minor XSS concern if labels are rendered unsanitized.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily standard Django form definitions with labels containing strings that could pose XSS risks if not escaped in templates. No active malicious behavior or malware is present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a minor security concern regarding label rendering. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
