  "purpose": "Standard Django management startup script that sets environment variable and executes command-line instructions.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments provided at runtime)",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line(sys.argv) (executes commands based on external input)",
  "flows": "sys.argv (source) → execute_from_command_line (sink) — executes commands based on untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; reliance on external input is typical but could be risky if manipulated",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django entry point that sets a default environment variable and runs commands based on command-line arguments. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security consideration is that it executes commands influenced by external input via sys.argv, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, this pattern is standard for management scripts. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risk of executing external commands but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django management script with no signs of malicious behavior or security flaws beyond normal operational considerations. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent. The minimal risk stems from reliance on external input, which is standard for such scripts. No modifications are necessary.",
