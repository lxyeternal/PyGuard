  "purpose": "Initialize and run Django management commands using environment settings.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments (sys.argv), environment variable setting (os.environ), import statements.",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line(sys.argv) potentially executes commands based on untrusted input; environment variable setting could influence Django configuration.",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> execute_from_command_line; os.environ setting influences Django environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard Django startup code; minimal anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings, imports the Django management execute function, and runs it with command-line arguments. It relies on sys.argv, which could be influenced by untrusted user input if run with external parameters. However, this is typical for Django management scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is evident. The code appears standard for Django projects and does not introduce security risks beyond normal operational considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django startup script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It simply executes Django commands based on provided arguments, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
