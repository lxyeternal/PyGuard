  "purpose": "The code reads and processes a pyproject.toml file to extract project metadata and sets configuration variables for Sphinx documentation.",
  "sources": "Reading the file '../pyproject.toml' and loading its content using 'tomllib.load'.",
  "sinks": "Assigning project metadata to variables, setting configuration parameters for documentation generation.",
  "flows": "File read -> parse data -> assign data to variables -> use variables in configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. No dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script securely reads a TOML configuration file to extract project name, version, and authors. It constructs version strings and copyright info based on current date and parsed data. It sets up documentation configuration parameters. All operations involve straightforward file I/O and data parsing without any suspicious logic or external communications. The code uses standard libraries and practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident. The code is clean, straightforward, and safe.",
