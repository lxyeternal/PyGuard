  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward script that reads a local 'pyproject.toml' file to extract project metadata (name, version, authors) and sets variables for Sphinx documentation configuration.\n- It uses standard libraries (`datetime`, `tomllib`) with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The data flow is simple: read file -> parse data -> assign variables.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code loads project metadata from a local file.\n- **Findings:** No unusual code, no secrets, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, supply chain issues, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** Reads local TOML, no external transmission, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Reads and processes project metadata for documentation.\n- **Findings:** Uses standard libraries, no external network, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign configuration script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Reads project metadata from 'pyproject.toml' for documentation setup.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, straightforward file I/O.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Reads project metadata, sets configuration variables.\n- **Findings:** Reads from a trusted local file, no untrusted data or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, secure configuration script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs standard configuration tasks.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0.\n- Confidence is high (1) across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code does not perform any dynamic execution, network calls, or handle untrusted input beyond reading a local trusted file.\n- The project metadata is sourced from a local file, which is standard practice.\n- The code is well-structured and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**I agree with the consensus of the reports.**  \n**The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.**  \nThe code is a typical, safe configuration script with no security concerns.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
