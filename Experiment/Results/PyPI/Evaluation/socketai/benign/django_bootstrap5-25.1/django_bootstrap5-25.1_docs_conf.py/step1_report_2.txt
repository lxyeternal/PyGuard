  "purpose": "Load and parse project metadata from a TOML configuration file to set up documentation configuration variables.",
  "sources": "File reading of '../pyproject.toml' and parsing with 'tomllib.load'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of parsed data to variables; no direct data leakage or external transmission.",
  "flows": "Reading the file ('../pyproject.toml') -> parsing data -> assigning to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, and no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local TOML file ('../pyproject.toml') to extract project information such as name, version, and authors. It constructs variables for use in documentation generation, like project name, version, author list, year, and copyright string. The data is sourced from a local file; there are no external inputs, and the data is only used internally for configuration. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no use of eval or exec, and no network activity. The code is straightforward and serves a configuration purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for documentation configuration, with no malicious behavior, no malware, and no significant security risks identified.",
