  "purpose": "The code reads project metadata from a local 'pyproject.toml' file and sets configuration variables for Sphinx documentation.",
  "sources": "Reading '../pyproject.toml' file, extracting 'project', 'version', and 'authors' data.",
  "sinks": "None; data is used internally for configuration, no untrusted data flow or external transmission.",
  "flows": "File read -> parse data -> assign variables for documentation setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries to read a local configuration file, extract project metadata, and set documentation parameters. It performs straightforward file I/O and data parsing without dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No logical flaws or security issues are present; the code is a typical, safe configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
