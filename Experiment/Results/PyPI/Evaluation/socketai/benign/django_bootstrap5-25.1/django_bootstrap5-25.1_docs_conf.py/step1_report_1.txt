  "purpose": "The code loads and processes project metadata from a local 'pyproject.toml' file for documentation configuration.",
  "sources": "File input: '../pyproject.toml' for reading project information.",
  "sinks": "Variables used for configuration: project, release, version, author, year, copyright, extensions, htmlhelp_basename, html_theme, pygments_style.",
  "flows": "Read 'pyproject.toml' -> parse data -> assign values to configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a TOML configuration file for project metadata, and sets configuration variables for documentation tools. All operations involve standard file reading and data parsing without any dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration script for Sphinx documentation, utilizing project metadata from a local file. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
