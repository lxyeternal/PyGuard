  "purpose": "Load and process project metadata from a pyproject.toml file for documentation configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the pyproject.toml file and extracting data from it.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being written to external systems or used in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the toml file and used internally for configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns; standard use of libraries and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code loads project metadata from a local TOML file, parses project name, version, authors, and sets configuration variables for documentation generation. Uses standard libraries without suspicious or malicious logic. No external network calls, no hidden code, no use of untrusted input beyond file reading. The code appears straightforward and intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration script for a documentation project with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
