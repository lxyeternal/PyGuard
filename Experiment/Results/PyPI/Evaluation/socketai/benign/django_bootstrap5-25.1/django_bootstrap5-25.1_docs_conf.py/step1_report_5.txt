{
  "purpose": "The code reads project metadata from a 'pyproject.toml' file and sets up configuration variables for documentation generation, such as extensions, theme, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "The code reads from '../pyproject.toml' file using open() and tomllib.load(). The 'pyproject.toml' file is a trusted input source.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns values to variables used for documentation configuration; no untrusted data is used in sensitive sinks like network, file write, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input from the file is parsed and assigned to variables; these variables are used in configuration but do not lead to untrusted actions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward file reading and variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The script opens a configuration file ('pyproject.toml') and loads its contents using 'tomllib'. It extracts project name, version, authors, and the current year. These values are used to configure documentation settings. The code only reads a local file and assigns values to variables; it does not perform any network activity, execute untrusted code, or handle sensitive data insecurely. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for a documentation build process. It securely reads project metadata and sets up documentation parameters without any malicious intent or security risks.",
