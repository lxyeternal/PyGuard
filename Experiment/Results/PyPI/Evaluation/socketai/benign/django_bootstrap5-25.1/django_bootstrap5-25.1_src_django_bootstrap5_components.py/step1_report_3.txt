  "purpose": "Render Bootstrap alert and button components with customizable options in a Django application.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters: alert_type, content, extra_classes, button_type, button_class, size, href, and other kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Render functions (render_tag, format_html) that output HTML content; potential injection points if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "User input parameters flow into render functions, which generate HTML tags and content; no evident untrusted data flow to critical sinks without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of translation functions and HTML rendering appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines rendering functions for Bootstrap alerts and buttons, validating parameters like alert_type and button_type to prevent misuse. User inputs are used in HTML attributes and content, but the code relies on the rendering functions 'render_tag' and 'format_html'. These are assumed to properly escape or handle unsafe content; however, if 'content' or other inputs are untrusted, there is a potential for HTML injection. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to typical Django rendering practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for rendering Bootstrap components in Django and does not contain malicious behavior. It properly validates certain parameters and uses safe rendering functions. No indicators of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
