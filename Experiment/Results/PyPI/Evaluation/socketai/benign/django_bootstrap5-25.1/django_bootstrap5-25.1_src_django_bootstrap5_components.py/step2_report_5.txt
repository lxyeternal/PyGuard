  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward, rendering Bootstrap alerts and buttons with validation on alert_type and button_type. No suspicious activity, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent, as no malicious behavior is detected.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — justified, given the safe use of parameters and rendering functions.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct, no obfuscation observed.  \n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential for XSS via the 'content' parameter. Notes that 'format_html' escapes content unless marked safe, and that the risk depends on content source.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, no malicious code or payloads are present.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly conservative; the main concern is untrusted 'content' leading to XSS, but the report correctly notes that 'format_html' escapes by default.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Observation:** The report correctly identifies that untrusted 'content' could pose XSS risks, but the overall code structure is safe if 'content' is sanitized before passing. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to Report 2, emphasizing validation and potential injection points via 'content' and other parameters.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware observed.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — similar reasoning; potential for injection if 'content' is untrusted, but the code itself is safe.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Note:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights parameter validation, safe rendering, and no malicious code.  \n- **Malware:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly conservative but acceptable given the potential for untrusted 'content'.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Emphasizes standard rendering, validation, and no suspicious activity.  \n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily safe, with the main caveat being the handling of 'content' which, if untrusted, could lead to XSS.  \n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.  \n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.  \n- The security risk scores are conservative but justifiable, considering potential injection if 'content' is untrusted.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** I agree with 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher than 0.2 in some reports might be justified if considering untrusted 'content'. Given the code uses 'format_html' (which escapes by default), the risk remains low. A score of 0.1–0.2 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering potential XSS if 'content' is untrusted, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's behavior. The code is a standard, safe implementation for rendering Bootstrap components in Django, with minimal security risks if inputs are sanitized or trusted. No supply chain or malicious behavior is evident.",
