  "purpose": "Render Bootstrap alert and button components with customizable options in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'content', 'alert_type', 'dismissible', 'extra_classes', 'button_type', 'button_class', 'size', 'href', 'extra_classes', and additional keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output HTML generated by 'render_tag', especially the 'format_html' function; potential injection if untrusted 'content' contains malicious HTML or scripts.",
  "flows": "User-provided 'content' flows into 'format_html' and then into 'render_tag', potentially leading to injection if 'content' is malicious. No other data flows into system-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'format_html' suggests careful handling of 'content', but if 'content' is untrusted and contains malicious HTML/JS, it could be executed in the browser. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. No network or file operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on rendering HTML components with user-provided content and parameters. The only potential security concern relates to the 'content' parameter, which is incorporated into HTML via 'format_html'. If 'content' originates from untrusted sources, it could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS). However, 'format_html' is designed to escape content properly unless explicitly marked safe, which is not evident here. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden logic, or malicious payloads. The code uses standard Django and Python practices for rendering safe HTML.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily responsible for rendering Bootstrap components with user-controlled content. The potential security risk depends on the source of 'content'. If 'content' is sanitized or trusted, the risk is minimal. The code does not include malicious or suspicious behavior beyond typical HTML rendering. Overall, the code appears safe, with a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
