  "purpose": "Render Bootstrap alert and button components with customizable options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (content, alert_type, dismissible, extra_classes, button_type, button_class, size, href, kwargs).",
  "sinks": "render_tag function outputs, format_html for content formatting.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence class strings and HTML output via render_tag and format_html.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or data leaks. No obfuscated code. Usage of gettext for translations is standard. No dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily generates HTML components for alerts and buttons using safe and controlled parameters. It performs input validation on alert_type and button_type, ensuring only expected values are accepted. The use of merge_css_classes, render_tag, and format_html suggests standard HTML rendering without suspicious behavior. No user input is directly executed or evaluated as code, and there are no external network interactions or data leaks. The functions handle HTML attributes securely and use translation functions properly.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, secure implementation for rendering UI components in a Django application. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
