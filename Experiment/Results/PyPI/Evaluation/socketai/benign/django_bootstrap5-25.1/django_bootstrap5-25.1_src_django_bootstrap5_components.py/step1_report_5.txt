  "purpose": "Render Bootstrap alert and button components with customizable options.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters: 'content', 'alert_type', 'extra_classes', 'button_type', 'button_class', 'size', 'href', additional keyword arguments (**kwargs).",
  "sinks": "render_tag function calls, format_html function, and string concatenation for button HTML, which generate HTML output.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> function parameters -> conditional logic and string formatting -> render_tag output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior. Usage of gettext for localization, merge_css_classes for CSS handling, and render_tag for output is standard. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate HTML components with proper validation of input parameters. ALERT_TYPES are validated to prevent invalid alert types. button_type validation prevents misuse. The content is inserted into HTML templates via format_html, which safely escapes content unless explicitly marked safe. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data flows that could lead to code execution or data leaks. No obfuscated or malicious code structures detected. The code's purpose is straightforward UI rendering with input validation and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for rendering Bootstrap alerts and buttons, with proper validation and no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears secure and free of supply chain risks based on this snippet.",
