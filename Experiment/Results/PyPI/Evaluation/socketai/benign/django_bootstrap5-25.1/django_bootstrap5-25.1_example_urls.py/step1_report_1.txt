  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for routing HTTP requests to appropriate Django views in a web application.",
  "sources": "The code reads static URL patterns and view imports. No external input sources or user data are read within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; URL routing uses predefined paths and views.",
  "flows": "Static URL paths direct to corresponding view classes' as_view() methods; no dynamic or user-input-based URL processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly defines URL routes without any suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several Django views and maps them to specific URL paths. All URL patterns are static strings and utilize class-based views with the standard as_view() method. No user input or external data sources are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious logic. The structure and content are consistent with typical Django URL configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It simply maps URL paths to view classes without processing untrusted data or executing suspicious logic.",
