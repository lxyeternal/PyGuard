  "purpose": "Define URL routing for a Django web application, mapping URL paths to view classes.",
  "sources": "URL pattern strings, view class imports, as_view() method calls",
  "sinks": "URL routing system, invocation of view methods",
  "flows": "URL pattern strings -> Django URL resolver -> view class as_view() method -> view logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports, no unusual code patterns or obfuscation; standard URL routing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django URL functions and view classes, then sets up URL patterns mapping paths to views. There are no input sources such as environment variables, user input, or external data reads. The use of as_view() is typical for class-based views. No data is being processed or transmitted here. The code appears straightforward, clean, and conventional for Django URL configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard URL routing configuration for a Django project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The implementation follows common practices and appears safe.",
