  "purpose": "Set up environment and run Django management commands",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, sys.argv input",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line with sys.argv",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> execute_from_command_line",
  "anomalies": "Use of setdefault for environment variable; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The script initializes the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable with a default value, then imports and runs Django's command-line utility. The code relies on sys.argv for input, which is standard for command-line scripts. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical Django project launcher without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django management script that sets up the environment and executes commands based on user input. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
