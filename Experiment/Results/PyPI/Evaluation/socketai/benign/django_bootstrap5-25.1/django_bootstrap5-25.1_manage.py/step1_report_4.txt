  "purpose": "This script initializes environment settings for a Django application and executes command-line management tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables and command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes arbitrary Django management commands via sys.argv",
  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line → Django management commands",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.environ.setdefault to set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE; no other suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings, then runs Django's command-line interface with provided arguments. It relies on standard Django practices without any obfuscated code or malicious constructs. The environment variable is hardcoded to a specific settings module, which is typical in controlled environments. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure and usage are straightforward and align with standard Django management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard entry point for a Django project, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely initializes the environment and executes commands, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
