  "purpose": "Standard Django management script to set environment variable and execute command-line instructions.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE",
  "sinks": "Execution of Django management commands via execute_from_command_line",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs are passed directly to execute_from_command_line, relying on Django's internal validation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django entry point that sets a default environment variable and executes commands based on command-line input. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reliance on sys.argv is standard; potential risks are external and depend on how the script is invoked. No internal malicious activity or security flaws are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django management script with no malicious intent or significant security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1) is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
