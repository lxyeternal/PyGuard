{
  "purpose": "The code performs minimal or benign operations with no external inputs or suspicious behavior, indicating it is intended for basic data processing or configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, module imports, or external files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, or environment variable access (potentially for data leakage or configuration).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file operations, but no malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow; code is minimal or empty, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either minimal or absent, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2, reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging limited context. Confidence levels are high given the straightforward descriptions. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code structure does not suggest sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately assess the code as benign with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
