  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code appears to function as intended, utilizing standard FIDO2 libraries and APIs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- The use of extensions for largeBlob is legitimate and aligns with FIDO specifications.\n- No external or hidden data flows, backdoors, or malicious payloads are apparent.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with high confidence (0.9) and no malware or obfuscation.\n- They emphasize that the data handling with websafe_encode/decode is standard and that the code uses well-established libraries.\n- No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the reports' reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The reports' scoring seems reasonable and consistent with their conclusions.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk or malware score above 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The highest risk score is 0.2, indicating low concern.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's usage of standard libraries and protocols.\n- They acknowledge that the code interacts with hardware devices but do not imply malicious intent.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n- The high confidence levels and low risk/malware scores align with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (consistent with low but non-zero risk due to potential misuse of largeBlob extensions, but overall benign)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the detailed reviews and the code's straightforward functionality, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a legitimate demonstration of FIDO2 largeBlob support with no malicious intent.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and performs expected operations within the FIDO2 protocol scope. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present.",
