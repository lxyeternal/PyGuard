{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the process of registering a FIDO2 credential with largeBlob extension support, writing a blob, and reading it back using a FIDO device and server APIs.",
  "sources": "get_client() function to obtain the FIDO device, server.register_begin(), server.register_complete(), client.make_credential(), client.get_assertion() for writing and reading blobs.",
  "sinks": "The extension data (largeBlob support) passed to make_credential and get_assertion functions, which interact with the hardware device; no external data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Source: get_client() and server methods provide data; sink: device credential creation and assertion; flow: credential creation -> extension data write -> extension data read.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard FIDO2 registration and authentication with largeBlob extension support, encoding and decoding data securely. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The data flows are typical for FIDO2 operations, and no external network activity or backdoors are present. The use of extensions is legitimate, and the code's purpose appears to be demonstration or utility. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The confidence in benignity is high, and the malware score is zero. The security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting potential misuse if the device is compromised, but this is theoretical and not specific to the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation demonstrating largeBlob support in FIDO2 devices. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
