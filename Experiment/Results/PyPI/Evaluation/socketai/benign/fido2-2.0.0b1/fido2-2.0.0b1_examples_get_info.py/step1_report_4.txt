  "purpose": "The code enumerates attached FIDO security devices (both HID and PC/SC) and performs specific commands (getInfo and wink) on supported devices.",
  "sources": "CtapHidDevice.list_devices(), CtapPcscDevice.list_devices(), dev.capabilities, dev.product_name, dev.serial_number, dev.version, dev.wink()",
  "sinks": "Printing device info, calling dev.wink() to send a wink command",
  "flows": "Device enumeration -> Device capability checks -> get_info() call -> dev.wink() command (if supported)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script lists connected FIDO devices via HID and PC/SC interfaces, printing device details and invoking standard commands based on capabilities. All actions are limited to device enumeration and management commands, with no data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or network activity. The commands used are standard for FIDO device interactions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard device enumeration and interaction script for FIDO security keys. It performs benign device queries and commands with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The overall design appears legitimate and aligned with normal device management functions.",
