{
  "purpose": "The script enumerates connected FIDO devices and performs info retrieval and a wink command if supported.",
  "sources": "CtapHidDevice.list_devices(), CtapPcscDevice.list_devices(), device properties (product_name, serial_number, version), device capabilities, dev.wink()",
  "sinks": "Printing device info (potential info leakage), dev.wink() (sends command to device), dev.close() (closes connection)",
  "flows": "enumerate_devices() yields devices -> info and capabilities are printed -> dev.wink() invoked if supported",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code enumerates connected FIDO devices via standard library calls, retrieves device information, and performs supported commands. All functions use publicly available APIs and perform standard device interactions. No hardcoded secrets, no network or file operations beyond device communication, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The script is straightforward in enumerating and interacting with devices without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign device enumeration and interaction script for FIDO hardware, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
