  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of FIDO2/WebAuthn credential management. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is the exposure of sensitive credential data via print statements, which should be managed carefully in production environments. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0.2 is appropriate."
