{
  "purpose": "Implements FIDO2/WebAuthn credential registration and authentication workflows, interacting with hardware tokens to create and verify credentials.",
  "sources": "Reads device info via get_client(), user data, credential responses, and prints sensitive credential data for debugging.",
  "sinks": "Outputs credential data, attestation objects, and user/authenticator info; prints sensitive data which could leak in logs.",
  "flows": "Device info and credential responses flow from hardware to code; credential data and responses are printed; registration and authentication flows are executed sequentially.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; printing sensitive credential data is typical for debugging but a privacy concern.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard FIDO2/WebAuthn procedures, using external libraries appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only operational concern is printing sensitive data, which could leak if logs are exposed. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscation score is 0, given the straightforward code. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor privacy concerns due to data exposure in logs. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of FIDO2/WebAuthn credential management. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is the exposure of sensitive credential data via print statements, which should be managed carefully in production environments. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0.2 is appropriate.",
