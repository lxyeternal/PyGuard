  "purpose": "Interface with an NFC reader (Acr122u) via PC/SC to retrieve reader version and control LEDs.",
  "sources": "APDU commands sent through self.pcsc.apdu_exchange; device enumeration via CtapPcscDevice.list_devices()",
  "sinks": "Output to console via print statements; no external data leaks or network activity",
  "flows": "Source: APDU command construction and device enumeration -> Sink: apdu_exchange execution and print outputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard hardware communication with an NFC reader, sending specific APDU commands to retrieve version info and control LEDs. Exception handling is limited to printing errors, which is typical for hardware interfaces. No external data transmission, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, with clear intent and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate device control script for an NFC reader, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis.",
