  "purpose": "Verify Yubico device attestation signatures using a trusted CA embedded in the code.",
  "sources": "Reading the embedded base64-encoded CA certificate, and the attestation result from the device.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic verification functions that validate the attestation signature against the CA.",
  "flows": "Input from device attestation -> CA lookup (static embedded CA) -> signature verification -> attestation validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or network activity. The CA is a legitimate, well-known root CA.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard FIDO2 attestation verification by using a static, legitimate Yubico root CA. It does not perform any suspicious operations, obfuscate code, or contain malicious behavior. The embedded CA is the official Yubico root CA, appropriate for verifying Yubico device attestations. The code's logic is straightforward, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with its purpose. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain issues are evident. The risk score is slightly above zero due to the static trust anchor, but this is standard practice and justified here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of Yubico device attestation verification. It poses no malware or obfuscation risks and has a very low security risk score. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
