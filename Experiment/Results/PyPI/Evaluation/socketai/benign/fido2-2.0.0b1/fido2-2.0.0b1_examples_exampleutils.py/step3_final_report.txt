  "purpose": "Utilities for interacting with FIDO2 authenticators, including device enumeration, user prompts, and client setup.",
  "sources": "Device enumeration functions, user input via getpass, platform detection via ctypes, optional device modules (CtapPcscDevice, WindowsClient).",
  "sinks": "PIN input stored in memory; no external data transmission or insecure storage; device interactions are local.",
  "flows": "Enumeration of devices -> selection based on predicate or platform -> user PIN request -> client creation and info retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and handles optional modules gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for FIDO2 device interaction, with secure PIN handling via getpass, proper device enumeration, and platform-specific support. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The logic is clear, and the security considerations are appropriate. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to PIN handling, which is managed securely. The supply chain risk appears negligible based on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
