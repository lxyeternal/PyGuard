{
  "purpose": "The code manages an NFC reader device via control exchange commands, retrieving device info, controlling LEDs, and adjusting polling and operation parameters.",
  "sources": "Control exchange responses from the device, specifically fixed command bytes sent via control_exchange method.",
  "sinks": "Responses are processed internally and printed; no external data transmission or leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Control commands are sent to the device; responses are parsed to extract device info, status, and settings; results are printed or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control codes beyond device-specific commands; no malicious payloads or external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with hardware via fixed control codes, parsing responses for device info and status. It performs standard device management functions without any malicious payloads, obfuscation, or network activity. The control codes are device-specific but not malicious. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk device management script for an NFC reader. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, justified by the absence of suspicious behaviors and the standard nature of device control operations.",
