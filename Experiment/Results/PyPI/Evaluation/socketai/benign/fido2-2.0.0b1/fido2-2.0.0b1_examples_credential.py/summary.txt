  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of FIDO2/WebAuthn workflows. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected. The primary concern is the exposure of sensitive data through print statements, which should be handled carefully in production environments. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
