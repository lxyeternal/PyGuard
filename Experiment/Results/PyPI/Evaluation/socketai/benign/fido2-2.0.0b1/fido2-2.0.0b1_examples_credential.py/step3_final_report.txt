  "purpose": "Implement FIDO2/WebAuthn credential registration and authentication workflows using hardware authenticators.",
  "sources": "get_client() function for device detection; server.register_begin(), server.register_complete(), server.authenticate_begin(), server.authenticate_complete() for credential handling; client.make_credential() and client.get_assertion() for credential creation and assertion.",
  "sinks": "Printing sensitive credential data (client_data, attestation_object, authenticator_data) to console, which could leak information if logs are insecure.",
  "flows": "Input from get_client() and external hardware; credential data flows through registration and authentication functions; sensitive data is printed after each step.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Printing sensitive data is a privacy concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard FIDO2/WebAuthn procedures for credential registration and authentication, using well-known libraries and functions. It outputs sensitive credential information via print statements, which could pose privacy risks if logs are insecure but does not constitute malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or code anomalies are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential privacy concerns. Overall, the code appears legitimate and free of malicious intent, with minor privacy considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of FIDO2/WebAuthn workflows. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected. The primary concern is the exposure of sensitive data through print statements, which should be handled carefully in production environments. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
