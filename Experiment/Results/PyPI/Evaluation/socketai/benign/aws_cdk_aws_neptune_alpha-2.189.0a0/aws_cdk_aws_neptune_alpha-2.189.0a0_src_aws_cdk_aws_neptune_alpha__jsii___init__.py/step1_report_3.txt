{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a package with dynamic path extension, type checking, and jsii assembly loading for AWS CDK constructs related to Neptune.",
  "sources": "Reads package version metadata, imports modules, and loads jsii assembly.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no network or file writes observed.",
  "flows": "Reads package version -> loads jsii assembly -> potentially uses imported modules for further operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. Use of __path__ extension is standard for package modules. The dynamic jsii assembly loading is typical for CDK modules. No unusual code behavior or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code manages package path extension, performs version-based type checking with the 'typeguard' library, and loads a jsii assembly for AWS CDK constructs related to Neptune. The version fetching from metadata appears standard. The 'check_type' function adapts based on 'typeguard' version, which is normal. The assembly load uses standard parameters. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. All imports and functions serve typical package setup purposes. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, malicious file operations, or suspicious network connections.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup for an AWS CDK construct package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration, type validation, and assembly loading without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
