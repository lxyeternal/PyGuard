  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script loads static JSON metadata, reads a README.md file, and calls `setuptools.setup()`. It notes no suspicious behavior, no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard setup procedures, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard package setup with no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard setup code with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward package setup without suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Scores:** All reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- **Additional notes:** Given the static nature of the JSON and the absence of dynamic or network activity, there is no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n\n**Estimated scores for the overall assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code appears safe and standard for a Python package setup.",
