  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report states no anomalies, no malicious code, and describes a standard setup script.\n- **Assessment:** The code loads static JSON, reads a README.md, and calls setuptools.setup(). No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; risk score 0 is justified. Confidence is high.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard package setup with no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Same logic applies; no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no external untrusted data handling.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, risk 0, appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external threats.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, risk 0, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard package setup, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external untrusted data.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a typical setup script with static JSON data and file reading operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or external dependencies that could be malicious, a low risk score (e.g., 0) is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard Python packaging script.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malicious payload, or obfuscation.\n- The JSON data is static and appears to be the package metadata.\n- Reading README.md is typical for package description.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat based on the provided analysis.",
