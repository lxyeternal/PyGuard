  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup process: loading static JSON metadata, reading README.md, and calling setuptools.setup().\n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Potential issues:** None. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, the code is standard for packaging, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical setup script with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard package setup.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; straightforward setup script with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm the code is standard and benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** No suspicious or malicious activity detected; scores are justified.\n- **Potential assumptions:** The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a typical setup script.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent across all reports.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros) are appropriate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is typical for open-source package configuration with no signs of compromise or malicious intent.",
