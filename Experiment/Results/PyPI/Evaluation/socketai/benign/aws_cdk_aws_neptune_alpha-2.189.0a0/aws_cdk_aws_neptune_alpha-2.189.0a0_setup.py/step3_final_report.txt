  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script loading static JSON metadata and README content for setuptools configuration.",
  "sources": "json.loads() for package metadata, open('README.md') for long description",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function call (initializes package installation process)",
  "flows": "json.loads() data used directly in setup(), README content passed to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; static JSON data, straightforward file read, no dynamic code or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code loads static JSON metadata for package configuration, reads a README.md file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with these parameters. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external untrusted data handling is present. The process is typical for Python package distribution scripts. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The JSON data is static and well-structured, and the file read is standard practice. The overall structure and content indicate a benign, standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals point to a typical package configuration process, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
