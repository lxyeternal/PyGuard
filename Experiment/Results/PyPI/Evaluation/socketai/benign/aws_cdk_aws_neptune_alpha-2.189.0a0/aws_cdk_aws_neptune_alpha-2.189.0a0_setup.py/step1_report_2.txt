{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, loading configuration data from a JSON string and reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "JSON string embedded in the code, external README.md file",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function which processes package metadata and configuration",
  "flows": "JSON string -> json.loads() -> kwargs dictionary -> open('README.md') -> kwargs['long_description'] -> setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: it loads configuration from an embedded JSON string, reads the README.md for long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with this data. The JSON data contains package metadata, dependencies, and URLs, all consistent with typical open-source package configuration. The code reads a local file (README.md), which is common for package descriptions. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network communication is present. There are no anomalies, obfuscated code segments, or signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
