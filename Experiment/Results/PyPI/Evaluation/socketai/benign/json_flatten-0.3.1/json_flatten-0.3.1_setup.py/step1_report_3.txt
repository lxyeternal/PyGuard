  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'json-flatten' that provides functions to flatten and unflatten JSON objects.",
  "sources": "os.path functions and open() call to read 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could cause data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content to populate long_description field during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or external data handling that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a version, and reads a README file for documentation. The setup() call configures package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No external data input, no suspicious logic, and no potential for malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
