  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata and read the README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file via os.path and open()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Reading README.md file as input, no data flows to other parts of code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README.md file for documentation, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with standard parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Minor variations in risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are unjustified given the absence of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the security risk score should also be 0, reflecting the absence of security issues.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
