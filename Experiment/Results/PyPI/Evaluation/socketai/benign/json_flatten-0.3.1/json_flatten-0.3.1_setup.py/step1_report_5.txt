  "purpose": "To define setup configuration for the 'json-flatten' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file to obtain a long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input from the README.md file flows into the 'long_description' parameter of the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup procedures; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'os' modules, defines a version, and includes a function to read a README file with proper encoding. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations are typical for a setup script. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The only I/O is reading a Markdown file for description, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
