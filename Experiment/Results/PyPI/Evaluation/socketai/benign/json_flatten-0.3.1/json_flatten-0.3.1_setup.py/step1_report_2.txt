  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package 'json-flatten' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, defining constants like VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for description; no data flows involving untrusted input or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads a README file for the long description and sets package metadata such as name, description, URL, license, and dependencies. There are no input/output flows involving untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
