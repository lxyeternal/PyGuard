  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n- Reads 'README.md' for long description.\n- Defines package metadata, dependencies, URLs, etc.\n- No suspicious or malicious code.\n- No external or untrusted data processing.\n- No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No hidden or obfuscated code.\n- No untrusted data flows or external command execution.\n- The only I/O is reading a local README.md file, which is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, legitimate, and free of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n- They correctly identify that the script is a standard setup configuration.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code are present.\n- All assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0 or very close (0.1 for report 1, but that is negligible).\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 or 0 (negligible, given the benign nature)\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The logic is sound; no assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't present.\n- The scores are reasonable, given the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate.",
