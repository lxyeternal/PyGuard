  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python package setup script.\n- The code reads a README.md file for the long description.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- No external or untrusted data flows, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The code uses common practices with no anomalies.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms no malicious behavior, standard practice.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low, possibly due to the nature of setup scripts generally being low risk)\n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, standard setup script.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, standard setup.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, standard setup.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion, no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is a typical setup script with no suspicious logic. **Malware score should remain 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward. **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (a standard setup script), the risk is minimal. The only slight concern might be if the setup script downloads or executes code dynamically, but that is not the case here. The reported security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which seems appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code reads a local README.md file; this is standard.\n- No external inputs or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- No signs of code injection, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script.\n- The malware score should be **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- The overall security risk score can remain very low, around **0**.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
