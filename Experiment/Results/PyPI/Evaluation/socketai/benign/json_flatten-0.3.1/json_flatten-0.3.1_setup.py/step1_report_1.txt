  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'json-flatten' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' -> use in long_description parameter of setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard setup script structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup and 'os' for file operations. It defines a function to read the long description from a README.md file, which is a common practice. The setup() call includes metadata such as package name, description, author, URL, license, version, modules, and optional dependencies. All code appears to be straightforward and adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. There are no evident malicious code injection points, obfuscated code, or unintended data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly reads a README file for documentation and specifies dependencies clearly. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
