  "purpose": "A utility for flattening and unflattening JSON objects while preserving type information, handling nested lists and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input JSON objects processed by flatten() and unflatten() functions, primarily within in-memory data structures.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without network, file, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects through recursive processing in _object_to_rows() for flattening, and through regex-based type conversion in unflatten, then reconstructed into nested structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard regex usage, straightforward recursion, no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe data serialization/deserialization, with no external interactions, code injection, or malicious behavior. It uses standard Python features and regex for pattern matching. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The only potential concern is misuse if untrusted data is processed without validation, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for JSON data flattening and unflattening, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 used in some reports is overly cautious; a score of 0 is justified given its safe, in-memory data handling.",
