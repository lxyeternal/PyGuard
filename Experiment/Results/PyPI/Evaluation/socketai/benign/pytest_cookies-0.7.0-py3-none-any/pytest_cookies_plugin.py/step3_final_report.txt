{
  "purpose": "The code provides testing fixtures and utility classes for managing Cookiecutter project scaffolding, configuration, and directory handling within a testing environment.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (yaml), command-line options, local filesystem (directory creation and file reading), function calls to generate context and prompt for config.",
  "sinks": "Local directory creation, reading configuration files, invoking cookiecutter functions, no external network or untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "Input from configuration files and command-line options flows into directory creation and function calls; no external data flows into system-sensitive actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing utility for Cookiecutter, managing project scaffolding and configuration without network activity or security-sensitive operations. It uses well-known libraries and handles exceptions gracefully. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on directory management and configuration prompting, with no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing and project scaffolding, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting its utility nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
