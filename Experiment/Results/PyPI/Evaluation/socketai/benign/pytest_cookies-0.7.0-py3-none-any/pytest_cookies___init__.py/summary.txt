  "conclusion": "The collective evaluation indicates minimal supply chain risk with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the evidence. The overall security posture of the dependency is benign, and continued monitoring is recommended if new code or behaviors emerge."
