  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security reports of an open source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, and synthesize an improved summary.",
  "sources": "No code provided; reports reference benign utility code, standard functions, or placeholders.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no suspicious network, file, or environment interactions mentioned.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed due to lack of code; reports indicate benign data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected across reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently note absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate given the lack of code or suspicious features. Confidence levels are high where detailed analysis is provided. The low risk score reflects conservative caution despite no evidence of threats. The reports are aligned in their assessments, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The collective evaluation indicates minimal supply chain risk with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the evidence. The overall security posture of the dependency is benign, and continued monitoring is recommended if new code or behaviors emerge.",
