  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script that processes input data and performs some form of computation or data handling, possibly related to user input or external data sources.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, file input, or network requests (if any are present), but specific sources are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout, logs, or writes to files; any network communication or system commands executed are potential sinks, but no such actions are explicitly visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as environment variables or files) through processing functions, and then possibly to outputs or external systems, but explicit flow details are not evident in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious API keys, or backdoors are detected. The code structure appears standard without obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing common Python constructs, standard library functions, and clear variable names. No evidence of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is present. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution. The code does not perform unsafe operations like SQL injection, code injection, or network communication with unknown hosts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal utility script with no evident supply chain security issues. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
