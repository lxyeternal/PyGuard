{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package intended for general utility functions, possibly for data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user inputs via functions like input(), and potentially data from external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, outputs data via print(), or sends data over network connections if such code exists.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) flow into processing functions that may output data, write to files, or transmit over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. No suspicious network activity, unusual code constructs, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure was examined thoroughly. It includes standard functions, imports only common libraries, and does not contain suspicious or malicious code patterns. No signs of code injection, data leakage, insecure handling of inputs, or malicious behaviors were found. Usage of third-party libraries is conventional, and no anomalies or obfuscated code detected. The code's purpose appears benign, focused on utility functions or data processing, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, legitimate Python module without harmful features.",
