  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'pkgmeta' to the current namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from '.pkgmeta'.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .pkgmeta import *' can lead to namespace pollution and obscure code origins, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement, which imports all symbols from a local module 'pkgmeta'. There are no data inputs, network operations, or code execution mechanisms visible. The presence of 'flake8: noqa' indicates suppression of linter warnings, possibly hiding code issues or warnings about style or import practices, but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is minimal and does not demonstrate any suspicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. No anomalies or malware indicators are detected.",
