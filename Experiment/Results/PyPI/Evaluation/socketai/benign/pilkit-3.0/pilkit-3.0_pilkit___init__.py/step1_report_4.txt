  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'pkgmeta' module, likely for package metadata or configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from '.pkgmeta' module",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; the code only performs an import",
  "flows": "The imported module could contain further code execution or data flows, but not visible here",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .pkgmeta import *' can be risky as it imports all symbols, potentially overwriting existing names or hiding malicious code. No evidence of malicious code in this snippet itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, ignoring flake8 warnings. It imports all symbols from a local module 'pkgmeta'. This pattern is common in package setups or metadata handling. No embedded malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity observed here. The lack of any additional logic or data processing reduces risk. However, the use of wildcard import can obscure code origin or intent if the imported module is malicious, but that cannot be determined solely from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, though the use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged for clarity and security. No malware suspected based on this code alone.",
