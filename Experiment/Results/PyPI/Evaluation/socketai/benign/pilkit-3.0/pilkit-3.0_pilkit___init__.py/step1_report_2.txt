  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'pkgmeta' module, likely for package metadata or configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.pkgmeta'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only an import operation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .pkgmeta import *' can be considered risky or bad practice, but not inherently malicious. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing everything from a local module. This is a standard pattern for package metadata or configuration. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The 'flake8: noqa' comment suppresses linting errors, possibly to avoid warnings about the wildcard import, but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for local package metadata. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The use of a wildcard import is potentially unsafe for code clarity but not malicious.",
