  "purpose": "Import all contents from the pkgmeta module, likely for metadata or configuration purposes within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.pkgmeta).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .pkgmeta import *' can be considered risky as it imports all names into the namespace, which could hide malicious or unexpected behavior, but on its own, it is not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement with a directive to ignore linter warnings. There is no evidence of data input, data manipulation, or network activity. The import is from a local module, and no further code or context is provided. This minimal code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent. The use of 'import *' is a potential concern for code clarity and namespace pollution but not inherently malicious. No security risks are identified based on this fragment.",
