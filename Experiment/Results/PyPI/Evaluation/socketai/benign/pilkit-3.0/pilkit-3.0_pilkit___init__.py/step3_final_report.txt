{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a local module, likely for metadata or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "The import loads symbols from '.pkgmeta' into the namespace; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' with suppression comment '# flake8: noqa'—a style concern, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward local import with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious; the suppression comment indicates awareness of this. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious operations are present. The minimal code and benign intent justify very low malware and security risk scores. The primary concern is style and namespace pollution, which does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate, mainly reflecting style issues rather than security concerns. All reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
