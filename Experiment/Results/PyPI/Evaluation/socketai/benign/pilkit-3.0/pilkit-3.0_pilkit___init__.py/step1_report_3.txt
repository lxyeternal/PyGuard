  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'pkgmeta' into the current namespace via import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .pkgmeta import *' is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, pulling all definitions from the 'pkgmeta' module. The 'flake8: noqa' directive disables linter warnings, which might hide issues but is common in certain contexts. There are no network operations, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The module 'pkgmeta' itself is not provided, so its content cannot be evaluated, but the import statement itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. The use of 'import *' is a known practice but could potentially lead to namespace issues; however, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
