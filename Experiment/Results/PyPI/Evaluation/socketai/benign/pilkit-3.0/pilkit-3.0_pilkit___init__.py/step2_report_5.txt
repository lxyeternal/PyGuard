  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .pkgmeta import *` with a `# flake8: noqa` comment.\n- The code is minimal, involving only a local import.\n- No data flows, network activity, or suspicious operations are evident.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or malware is present in these snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence and behavior:\n- The code **matches** the description across all reports.\n- **No malicious behavior** is indicated or implied by the code itself.\n- The only concern is the use of `import *`, which is a style and maintainability issue, not a security issue.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The main \"flaw\" is stylistic: using `import *` can hide imported symbols and cause namespace pollution.\n- The suppression of linting warnings (`# flake8: noqa`) suggests awareness of this issue, possibly to avoid warnings.\n- No actual security flaws or malicious code are evident.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is consistent; there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All are low (around 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores above 0.1-0.2 would be unjustified.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the use of `import *` as a potential concern but do not treat it as malicious.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n- No report suggests any assumption that could be challenged; all are cautious but accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to style concerns but not security)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the uniformity and the lack of any suspicious activity, I agree with the current scores. However, I would suggest the following adjustments for clarity:\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious activity detected                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | No obfuscation present                                      |\n| Risk            | 0.1               | Minor concern about `import *`, but not security-related  |\n\n**In conclusion:** The code is benign, and the current scoring accurately reflects that. The main concern is stylistic, not security.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Since all reports are consistent, no further action is needed beyond confirming that this code fragment is not malicious.",
