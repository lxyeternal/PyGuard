      "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a known pattern of dynamic metadata loading. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which should be trusted and verified. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are zero, risk is low (~0.2). Maintain secure handling of 'pkgmeta.py' to prevent potential malicious execution."

      "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard utility code with no malware or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the potential for misuse of getattrsafe with untrusted input, which is a known pattern but not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate; a slight adjustment to the risk score to around 0.3 could better reflect this potential, but overall, the security posture is very low risk."
