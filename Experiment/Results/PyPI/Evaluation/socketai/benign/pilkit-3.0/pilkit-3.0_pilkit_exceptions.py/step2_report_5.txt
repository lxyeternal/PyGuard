  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code defines two exception classes with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, straightforward, and only consists of class definitions.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or suspicious behavior is present.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports' assessments that the code is benign and free of malicious or obfuscated features are accurate.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues are found in the reasoning or summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no malicious or risky behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - **Conclusion:** Scores are justified as they reflect the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's content, not assumptions.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - **Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reflect the benign nature of the code.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and the actual code content.",
