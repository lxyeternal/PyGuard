  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The original code defines two classes inheriting from Exception:\n     ```python\n     class UnknownExtension(Exception):\n         pass\n\n     class UnknownFormat(Exception):\n         pass\n     ```\n   - No other logic, data handling, input/output, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - All reports are consistent in stating that the code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - No report claims any hidden behavior, malicious intent, or anomalies.\n   - The reasoning is sound: defining custom exceptions is common and harmless.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - Malware: 0 (no malware)\n     - Security Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code content.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code snippet; all conclusions are consistent.\n   - The reports correctly avoid speculative claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware and Risk Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no malicious behavior, malware score should remain at 0.\n   - Security risk is also correctly at 0, as there's no data processing, external calls, or other security-sensitive operations.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports correctly identify that this code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes are necessary.",
