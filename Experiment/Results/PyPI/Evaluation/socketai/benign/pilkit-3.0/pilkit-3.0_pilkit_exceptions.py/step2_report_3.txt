  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - No input/output operations, data processing, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code appears straightforward, minimal, and typical for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and free of malicious or security risks.\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in these summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk is also 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - Since the code is only class definitions for exceptions, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is just exception class definitions with no hidden or malicious behavior.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' thoroughness, I concur with the current scores. However, to be thorough, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nsince the code is purely definitional, with no suspicious features.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
