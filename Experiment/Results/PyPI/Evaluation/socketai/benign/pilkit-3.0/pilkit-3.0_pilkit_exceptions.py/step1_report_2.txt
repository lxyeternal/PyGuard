  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling unknown extension and format errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points present",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from the base Exception class. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard, minimal exception class definitions, common in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serves as custom exception definitions, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
