  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Issues**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only contains two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that there are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or security risks.  \n- Since the code is purely definitional, there are no logical flaws or reasoning errors to point out.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, obfuscated as 0, malware as 0, and securityRisk as 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- No changes are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n- The reports assign a securityRisk of 0, which is justified because the code does not perform any actions that could lead to security issues.  \n- Malware score is 0, which is accurate; no malicious behavior is present.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions or Claims**:  \n- All reports assume the code is benign based solely on static analysis of class definitions. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, this assumption is reasonable.  \n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the assessments are cautious and appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and conclusions in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall**, the code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
