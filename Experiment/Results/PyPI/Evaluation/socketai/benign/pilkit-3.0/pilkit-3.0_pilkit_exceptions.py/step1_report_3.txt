{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for unknown extension and format errors.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, used for error handling. There are no input operations, data processing, or security-sensitive actions. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are present. The classes serve as custom exceptions, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, creating two custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or potentially malicious actions.",
