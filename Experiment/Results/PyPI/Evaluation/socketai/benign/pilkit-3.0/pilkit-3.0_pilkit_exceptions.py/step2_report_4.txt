  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code consists solely of two class definitions:\n     ```python\n     class UnknownExtension(Exception):\n         pass\n\n     class UnknownFormat(Exception):\n         pass\n     ```\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The classes are simple custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, minimal, and only defines exception classes.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional, there's no actual security risk or malicious behavior.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n   - No need to adjust scores based on the current analysis.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The reports do not suggest any hidden behavior or malicious intent.\n   - The exception classes are standard and common in many codebases.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications or adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- I concur with the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **securityRisk = 0**.\n- The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign purpose.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
