  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for unknown extension and format errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources read by the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions, no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception. It does not include any data handling, input/output operations, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions, likely part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard declaration of two custom exception classes with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and does not contain any anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
