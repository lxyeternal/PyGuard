{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes for handling unknown extensions and formats.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two straightforward class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign, minimal nature of the code. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the current scoring appropriately reflects the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
