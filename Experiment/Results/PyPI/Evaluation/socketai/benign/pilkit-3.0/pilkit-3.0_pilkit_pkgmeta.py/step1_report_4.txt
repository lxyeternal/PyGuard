  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data sinks, no output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials beyond standard package metadata, no obfuscation, and no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static variable assignments for package metadata, which is typical and non-suspicious. No input handling, no data transmission, and no dynamic code execution present. The structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only harmless package metadata definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
