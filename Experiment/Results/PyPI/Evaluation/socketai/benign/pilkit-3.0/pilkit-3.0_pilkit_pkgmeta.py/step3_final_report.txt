  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata variables for the 'pilkit' Python package, serving as static module-level information.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to __title__, __author__, __version__, __license__, and __all__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments defining package metadata, a common pattern in Python packages. There are no functions, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's simplicity confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports accurately assess its benign nature, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or modification is necessary.",
