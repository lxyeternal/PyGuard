  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**  \nAll reports describe the code as static string assignments to module-level variables (__title__, __author__, __version__, __license__, __all__). The original code confirms this, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a standard package metadata declaration with no malicious or security concerns. There are no flawed assumptions or reasoning errors.\n\n3. **Scores Review**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, clear nature of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of any malicious activity or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code only contains benign metadata assignments.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nSince all scores are 0, no further justification is necessary. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Evaluation**  \nThe malware score of 0 across all reports is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions**  \nAll reports are based on static analysis and seem to have considered all relevant factors. There are no assumptions that need challenging.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static package metadata declaration. It contains no dynamic behavior, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe package metadata code is benign, safe, and typical for Python packages. No security risks or malware concerns are present.",
