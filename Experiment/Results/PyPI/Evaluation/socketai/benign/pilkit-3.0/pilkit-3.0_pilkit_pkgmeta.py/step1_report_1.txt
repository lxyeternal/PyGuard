  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the Python package 'pilkit', including title, author, version, license, and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments at the module level.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns string literals to module-level variables that describe package metadata. There are no external data inputs, no processing logic, and no potential for data leakage or malicious activity. The structure and content are typical for Python package metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package metadata definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
