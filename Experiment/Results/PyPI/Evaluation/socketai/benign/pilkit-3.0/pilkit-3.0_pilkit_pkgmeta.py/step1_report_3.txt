  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'pilkit' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string literals to metadata variables (__title__, __author__, __version__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Simple variable assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments containing package metadata information. There are no input operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code does not perform any network communication, file I/O, or dynamic execution. It appears to be standard metadata declaration typically found in Python package init files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides package information and does not contain any harmful or suspicious behavior.",
