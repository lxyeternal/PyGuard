  "purpose": "Defines metadata attributes for the 'pilkit' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of metadata variables (__title__, __author__, __version__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from input to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only metadata assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments that specify package metadata, a common and benign practice. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. The code lacks any dynamic execution, credential handling, or network activity. No obfuscated code, malicious constructs, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a simple, benign module defining package information.",
