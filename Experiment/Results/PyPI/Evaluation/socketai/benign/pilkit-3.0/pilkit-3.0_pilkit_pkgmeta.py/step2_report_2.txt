  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a set of static string assignments to module-level variables (`__title__`, `__author__`, `__version__`, `__license__`, and `__all__`).\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code serves as package metadata, which is standard practice in Python packages.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is benign, consisting solely of static metadata assignments.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are identified.\n   - The reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Evaluation of the Scores:**\n   - The scores given are consistent with the code's content.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The malware scores are 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n4. **Critical Observations:**\n   - The code is standard package metadata; such code is common and safe.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here.\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely static metadata, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this assessment.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nBased on the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a safe, standard package metadata file with no security concerns.",
