  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'pilkit' package including title, author, version, license, and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for __title__, __author__, __version__, __license__, and __all__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata definitions are isolated",
  "anomalies": "Absence of input handling, external data access, or dynamic code execution; only static assignments",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static variable assignments that describe package metadata. No input sources, no sinks, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The structure and content are typical for package metadata files and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and purely informational.",
