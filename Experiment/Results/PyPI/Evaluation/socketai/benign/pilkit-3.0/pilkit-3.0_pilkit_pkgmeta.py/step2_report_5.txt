  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of string assignments defining package metadata: `__title__`, `__author__`, `__version__`, `__license__`, and `__all__`.\n   - There are no functions, no dynamic code, no input/output operations, and no external data handling.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious constructs, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is static metadata with no data flows, inputs, or outputs.\n   - They consistently conclude that the code is benign, which aligns with the actual content.\n   - No report makes unsupported claims or assumptions about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they correctly interpret the code as standard metadata.\n   - There are no indications of backdoors, credential handling, or external communication.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical package metadata file.\n   - There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reports' conclusions are justified and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
