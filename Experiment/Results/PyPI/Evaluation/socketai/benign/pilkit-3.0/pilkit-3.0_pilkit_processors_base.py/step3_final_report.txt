{
  "purpose": "Provides various image processing utilities such as adjustments, reflection, transposing, and opacity modifications using PIL/Pillow.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from input images; accesses EXIF data for orientation; uses getattrsafe for safe attribute retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into external systems; no network or file output; processes images in memory only.",
  "flows": "Image data flows from input, through processing methods (adjustments, reflection, transposing, opacity), and returns the processed image.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of getattrsafe is a standard defensive pattern, not malicious; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks with PIL/Pillow, including color adjustments, reflections, rotations, and opacity changes. It safely accesses image attributes and EXIF data, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious code. The use of getattrsafe ensures compatibility across different PIL versions but does not introduce security issues. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common libraries without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image processing utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. All signals and scores are consistent with its functionality, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1).",
