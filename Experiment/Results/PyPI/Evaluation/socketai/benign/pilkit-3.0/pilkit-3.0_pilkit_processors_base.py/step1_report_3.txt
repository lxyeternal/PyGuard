{
  "purpose": "The code provides image processing functionalities such as color adjustments, reflection, transposing, anchoring, and making images opaque, primarily for image manipulation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input image objects passed to process methods of various classes (e.g., Adjust, Reflection, Transpose, MakeOpaque).",
  "sinks": "Output images after processing, which could potentially be used maliciously if combined with network operations or file operations (not present here).",
  "flows": "Image objects flow through process methods, with no external data or untrusted inputs involved in the code logic itself.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of getattrsafe and image transposition methods appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are detected. No network operations or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple image processing classes for color adjustment, reflection, transposing based on EXIF data, anchoring points, and making images opaque. Each class performs standard image manipulations without external data input beyond the image objects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The code relies on PIL (Python Imaging Library) functions in a typical manner. No hardcoded credentials, hidden backdoors, or suspicious operations are detected. The overall design appears to be legitimate image processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard image processing functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on image data with no external data leaks or network activity. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is very low.",
