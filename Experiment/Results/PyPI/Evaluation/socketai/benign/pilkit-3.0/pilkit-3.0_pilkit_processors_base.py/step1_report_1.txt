{
  "purpose": "This code provides various image processing utilities such as adjustments, reflections, transpositions, and making images opaque.",
  "sources": "Input images passed to process methods of classes like Adjust, Reflection, Transpose, and MakeOpaque.",
  "sinks": "Processed images returned from process methods; no data flows to external systems or network sinks.",
  "flows": "Image data flows from input to processing functions within each class, with no external data or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of getattrsafe suggests dynamic attribute access, but this is for flexibility, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of image processing classes performing transformations and enhancements using PIL/Pillow library functions. No external network access, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. All functions operate on image objects, primarily converting, merging, flipping, rotating, and applying effects. The use of getattrsafe for optional attributes appears safe. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malware behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of image processing utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs common image transformations without involving external systems or sensitive data leaks.",
