{
  "purpose": "Provides image processing utilities including format conversions, file handling, and error management for PIL/Pillow images.",
  "sources": "File streams (outfile, target), image objects (img), format and extension inputs, environment variables (via mimetypes), and standard input data.",
  "sinks": "Image.save() method, file pointer seek/tell, and potential exception handling points; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input data from file-like objects or image objects flow into save_image() and prepare_image(), which process and save images; error handling manages exceptions during file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; suppression of stderr via 'quiet' context manager is a common pattern, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility module for image format handling, conversion, and file I/O. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with proper error handling and resource management. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code is present. The suppression of stderr is a benign pattern to reduce log noise. Functions perform expected tasks with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image processing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to standard file handling and error suppression.",
