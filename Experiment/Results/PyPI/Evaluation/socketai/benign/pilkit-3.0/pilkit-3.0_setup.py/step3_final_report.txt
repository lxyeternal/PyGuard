{
  "purpose": "Load package metadata from 'pkgmeta.py' without importing the package, to provide version and other info for setup.",
  "sources": "Reading 'pkgmeta.py' file and executing its content via exec()",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'pkgmeta.py' via exec() which could run arbitrary code if the file is malicious or tampered with",
  "flows": "Read 'pkgmeta.py' -> compile -> exec -> use data in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run external code; no validation or sandboxing; straightforward code otherwise",
  "analysis": "The code reads 'pkgmeta.py' and executes it to load package metadata, a common pattern but with security implications. No malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscation detected. The primary risk is if 'pkgmeta.py' is compromised, malicious code could execute during setup. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the exec() pattern. The code is standard and clear, with no signs of malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the analysis, reflecting a low but acknowledged risk associated with executing external code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a known pattern of dynamic metadata loading. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which should be trusted and verified. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are zero, risk is low (~0.2). Maintain secure handling of 'pkgmeta.py' to prevent potential malicious execution.",
