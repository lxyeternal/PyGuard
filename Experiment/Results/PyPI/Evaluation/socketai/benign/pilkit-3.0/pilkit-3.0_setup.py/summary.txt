  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a known pattern of dynamic metadata loading. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which should be trusted and verified. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are zero, risk is low (~0.2). Maintain secure handling of 'pkgmeta.py' to prevent potential malicious execution."
