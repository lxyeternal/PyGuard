  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pilkit' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'pkgmeta.py' file for package metadata, and 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or system command execution present.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata from 'pkgmeta.py' and description from 'README.rst' to configure setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'exec' to run code from 'pkgmeta.py', which can be risky if the file is tampered with. No other anomalies or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. The only potentially risky element is executing code from 'pkgmeta.py' via 'exec' after compiling it. This allows dynamic code execution but is common in setup scripts to load package metadata without importing the package directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated code. All other code is straightforward and consistent with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a single potential security concern regarding 'exec' on an external file. Given that 'pkgmeta.py' is intended for package metadata and not designed to be malicious, the risk is low but warrants caution. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
