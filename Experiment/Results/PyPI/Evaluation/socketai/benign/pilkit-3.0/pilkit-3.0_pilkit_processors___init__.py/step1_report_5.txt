{
  "purpose": "To provide a module that imports various image processing classes or functions for image manipulation tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.base, .crop, .convert, .filter, .overlay, .resize). No external input or data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this snippet; the code is purely import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports other modules, so no execution flow is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The comments suggest decoupling from filesystem, but no code implements that here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains import statements for various image processing modules. There are no functions, data handling, or input/output operations present that could indicate malicious intent. The comments describe a design philosophy but do not imply any malicious behavior. Since the code is only importing modules, there are no evident security risks or malware vectors in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import aggregator with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as part of an image processing library, and there are no suspicious elements present.",
