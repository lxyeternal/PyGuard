{
  "purpose": "To provide image processing functionalities via different modules such as cropping, converting, filtering, overlaying, and resizing.",
  "sources": "Import statements that include all functions and classes from local modules (.base, .crop, .convert, .filter, .overlay, .resize).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations shown.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules without processing data or handling user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed; the file is a straightforward set of import statements with a descriptive comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules related to image processing. The initial comment describes the purpose of the modules. No data input/output, environment variable usage, or executable logic is present. The imports are standard for a modular image processing library. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The code appears to be a benign module initializer.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign import module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an aggregator for various image processing functionalities without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
