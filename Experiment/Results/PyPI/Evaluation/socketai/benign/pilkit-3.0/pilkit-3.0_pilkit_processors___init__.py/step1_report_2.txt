  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .crop, .convert, .filter, .overlay, .resize). No external data sources or user input are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present. The code only imports modules and contains comments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely import statements and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments describing image processors and import statements for local modules. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other operations that could introduce security risks. The comments clarify that processors are intended for image manipulation and decouple from filesystem interactions. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as documentation and import setup for image processing modules. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious or pose security risks.",
