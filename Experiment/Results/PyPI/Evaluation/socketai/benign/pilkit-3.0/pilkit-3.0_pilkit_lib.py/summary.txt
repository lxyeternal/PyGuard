  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard utility code with no malware or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the potential for misuse of getattrsafe with untrusted input, which is a known pattern but not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate; a slight adjustment to the risk score to around 0.3 could better reflect this potential, but overall, the security posture is very low risk."
