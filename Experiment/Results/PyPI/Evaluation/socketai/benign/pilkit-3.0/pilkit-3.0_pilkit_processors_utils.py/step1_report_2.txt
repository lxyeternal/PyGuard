{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing images, including counting colors, calculating histogram entropy, and resolving image palettes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'image' object, specifically image.mode, image.size, image.histogram(), and image.palette.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to security effects or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the image input through functions that analyze its properties (color count, entropy, palette resolution). No untrusted data is used to influence external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual operations are detected. The code relies on standard image processing functions without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard image analysis tasks: counting colors, computing histogram entropy, and palette conversion. The entropy calculation uses a fallback method, which is normal. No network operations, code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code utilizes safe standard library functions and library methods. It does not manipulate untrusted input in a way that would lead to vulnerabilities, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward image processing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code is safe and does not pose supply chain security concerns.",
