{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for image processing, including counting colors, calculating histogram entropy, and resolving palettes.",
  "sources": "Reads image properties such as mode, size, histogram, and palette from the PIL Image object.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; operates solely on image data within the application.",
  "flows": "Processes image attributes internally; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a fallback method for histogram entropy and a relative import, but both are standard practices and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks using PIL, with safe patterns like fallback functions and typical import structures. No network, file, or system command execution is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The fallback entropy function and relative import are benign and common in package modules. The code's logic is straightforward and correct, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the absence of security concerns.",
