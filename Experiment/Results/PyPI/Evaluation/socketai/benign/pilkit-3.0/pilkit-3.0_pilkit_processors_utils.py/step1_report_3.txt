{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for image processing, including color counting, entropy calculation, and palette resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads image properties such as mode, size, histogram, and palette; imports modules from relative paths.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to potential data leak or effect; no external network or system modification calls.",
  "flows": "Reads image data, processes histograms and palettes, returns computed values without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of relative import may be unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to analyze images: counting colors, calculating histogram entropy, and resolving palettes. It uses standard libraries and methods; no data leaks or harmful operations are present. The fallback to a Python implementation for entropy calculation appears normal. Importing from a relative module ('..lib') is typical in package development and not inherently suspicious. There are no obfuscated parts or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate image processing tasks with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard image processing utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions as expected for legitimate image analysis purposes.",
