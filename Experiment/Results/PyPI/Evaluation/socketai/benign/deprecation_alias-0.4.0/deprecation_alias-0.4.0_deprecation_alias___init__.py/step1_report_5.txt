{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing warnings and modifying their docstrings to inform users about deprecation status.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (__author__, __version__, __email__), imports from standard library and third-party modules, and the function parameters for deprecation details.",
  "sinks": "The code issues warnings via the warnings.warn() function, which could potentially be exploited if warnings are mishandled, but this is a standard and safe mechanism. No untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Parameters like deprecated_in, removed_in, current_version, and details influence warning generation; these are used to determine if a warning should be issued when the decorated function is called.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets, are present. The code follows standard practices for deprecation decorators. No external network or data exfiltration appears involved.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a decorator 'deprecated' that modifies function docstrings and emits warnings based on version comparisons. It uses version parsing and date comparisons to determine deprecation status. The code manages string manipulations for docstrings and conditionally issues warnings. There are no signs of malicious payloads or suspicious behavior, and the code uses safe, standard Python practices for warnings and version handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages deprecation warnings and docstring modifications, following typical design patterns.",
