{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around the 'deprecation' library to support deprecated aliases with enhanced docstring and warning modifications.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'warnings', 'deprecation', 'packaging', and standard library modules. Function parameters: 'deprecated_in', 'removed_in', 'current_version', 'details', 'name', 'func'.",
  "sinks": "Usage of 'warnings.warn' to emit deprecation or unsupported warnings. String formatting for deprecation notes. No untrusted input handling or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Function parameters provide versioning info, which influences warning behavior. The decorator modifies function docstrings and emits warnings based on version comparisons. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code primarily manipulates docstrings and issues warnings. No obfuscated or suspicious logic. Usage of 'deprecation' library is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a 'deprecated' decorator to mark functions as deprecated, modifying their docstrings and issuing warnings based on version comparisons. It performs version parsing, date checks, and conditional warning emission, all within standard, benign operations. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or harmful actions. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with no suspicious or anomalous patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a deprecation decorator with no signs of malware or security risks. It only modifies function metadata and emits warnings to inform users about deprecation status. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
