  "purpose": "A utility to decorate functions for deprecation warnings, updating docstrings and issuing warnings about deprecated or soon-to-be-removed functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (datetime, functools, warnings, typing, deprecation, packaging) and reads function parameters and attributes, especially in 'deprecated' function.",
  "sinks": "Uses warnings.warn to issue deprecation/unsupported warnings. No external or untrusted data is used directly in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Function parameters (deprecated_in, removed_in, current_version, details, name, func) influence warning behavior and docstring modification; warnings.warn issues warnings based on version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or misleading variable use. The code performs version comparisons and string manipulations in a straightforward manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, modifying their docstrings and issuing warnings based on version info. It performs version parsing, date comparisons, and constructs warning messages without executing malicious actions. No external network calls, data leaks, or system modifications are present. The logic appears standard for a deprecation utility, with proper use of warnings and string handling. The only potentially unusual aspect is the dynamic modification of docstrings, but this is a common pattern in Python for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behavior. It performs version checks and warning generation responsibly. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
