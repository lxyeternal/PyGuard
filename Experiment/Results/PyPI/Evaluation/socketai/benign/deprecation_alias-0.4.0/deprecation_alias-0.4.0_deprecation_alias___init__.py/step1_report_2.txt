{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing warnings and updating docstrings accordingly.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (datetime, functools, textwrap, warnings, typing) and a third-party 'deprecation' module.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'warnings.warn' to emit deprecation or unsupported warnings, and modifies function __doc__ strings.",
  "flows": "Decorator logic assesses version dates and conditions, then issues warnings and updates docstrings, with no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code only manipulates warnings and docstrings, following standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a 'deprecated' decorator that marks functions as deprecated, issuing warnings based on version checks. It handles date and version comparisons, modifies function docstrings, and uses warnings modules for notifications. No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected, as the code operates within typical deprecation patterns without external data or command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator with no malicious intent. It manages warnings and docstring modifications responsibly. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or sabotage. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
