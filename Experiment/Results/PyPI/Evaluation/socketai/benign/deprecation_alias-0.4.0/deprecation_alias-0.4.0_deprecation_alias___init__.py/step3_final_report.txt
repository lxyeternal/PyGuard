  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, modifying their docstrings and issuing warnings upon invocation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (deprecated_in, removed_in, current_version, details, name), function __doc__",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() calls, modifications to function __doc__",
  "flows": "Parameters influence warning issuance and docstring updates; warnings issued during function call",
  "anomalies": "None; standard warning and docstring modification logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a deprecation decorator. It checks version and date parameters to determine deprecation status, modifies the function's docstring to include deprecation notices, and issues warnings when the function is called. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious code. The warning mechanism is typical and safe, and the docstring modifications follow PEP 257 conventions. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented deprecation utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is likely due to warnings being potentially misused if warnings are ignored, but this is a standard, non-malicious aspect of Python warnings. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and appropriate for managing deprecation notices.",
