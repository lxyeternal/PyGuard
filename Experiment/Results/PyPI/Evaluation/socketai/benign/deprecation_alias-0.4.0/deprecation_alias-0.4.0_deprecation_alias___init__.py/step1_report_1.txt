{
  "purpose": "This module provides a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing warnings and modifying their docstrings accordingly.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (datetime, functools, textwrap, warnings, typing), third-party 'deprecation' library, and 'packaging' library; function parameters and local variables within 'deprecated'.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued via warnings.warn(), modified function __doc__, and potential input from function arguments.",
  "flows": "Parameters (like deprecated_in, removed_in, current_version) influence logic that determines warning type; the decorator wraps functions to issue warnings and modify docstrings upon invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code strictly manages warnings and docstring modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'deprecated' decorator that manages deprecation warnings and docstring updates based on version and date parameters. It performs version comparison using 'packaging.version', constructs deprecation messages, and applies warnings during function calls. No input or output sources indicate malicious data handling. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present. The logic appears solely for deprecation management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a deprecation decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data collection, or system manipulation beyond issuing warnings and modifying docstrings.",
