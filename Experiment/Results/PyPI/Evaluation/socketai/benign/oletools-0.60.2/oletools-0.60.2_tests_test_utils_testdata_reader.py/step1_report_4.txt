  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for reading and decrypting test files, specifically handling zip-encrypted files for test data management in security testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "File system reads via open(), zipfile.ZipFile.read(), and os.walk() for directory traversal.",
  "sinks": "Reading files into memory, extracting zip contents, creating temporary files for decrypted data.",
  "flows": "File system data flows into memory during read or decryption; zip files are opened and their contents are extracted into temporary files for use.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded password ('infected-test') for zip decryption; decryption functions generate temporary files that may be retained if exceptions occur; no explicit input validation, though the inputs are mostly file paths; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions for reading test files, including handling encrypted zip files with a static password. It uses standard libraries and some fallback imports for older Python versions. The 'read_encrypted' function reads zip contents using the hardcoded password, which is intended for test scenarios, not production. The 'decrypt_sample' context manager creates temporary files for decrypted data, cleaning up afterward, with an exception for non-zip files. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. The static password could be a concern if used maliciously outside its intended testing scope, but within this context, it is benign. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for handling test data files, including encrypted zip files, with no malicious intent or malware indicators. Its design is straightforward, focused on reading and decrypting test files, with proper cleanup procedures. The only noteworthy concern is the use of a hardcoded password for decryption, which is acceptable within test environments but could be a security issue if misused outside such contexts.",
