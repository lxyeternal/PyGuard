  "purpose": "Helper functions for handling encrypted zip test files, primarily for reading and decrypting test samples.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the filesystem (`open`, `os.walk`), reading from zip archives (`zipfile.ZipFile.read`) with a password.",
  "sinks": "Return of file contents to caller functions; creation and deletion of temporary files during decryption process.",
  "flows": "Reading files from disk or zip archives; decrypting zip entries using a fixed password; temporarily storing decrypted data in temp files; yielding file paths for further use.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded password (`'infected-test'`), which could be exploited if known. Temporary file creation and deletion process appears standard; no suspicious code structures or obfuscation. The code handles older Python versions, but this does not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for reading unencrypted and encrypted test data files, especially zip files encrypted with a fixed password. It employs standard library modules (`zipfile`, `os`, `tempfile`) and straightforward logic for reading files, decrypting zip contents, and managing temporary files. The hardcoded password could be a security concern if misused, but within the scope of test data handling, it does not present malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code also properly manages resources, with exception handling during decryption and cleanup of temporary files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed solely for handling test data files, including encrypted samples, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The use of a hardcoded password is a potential security risk if the code is misused, but it is appropriate within a controlled testing environment. No indicators of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are observed.",
