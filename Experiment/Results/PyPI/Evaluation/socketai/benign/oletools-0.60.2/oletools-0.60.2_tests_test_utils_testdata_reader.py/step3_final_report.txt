  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading, decrypting, and handling test files, especially zip files encrypted with a fixed password ('infected-test').",
  "sources": "Reads input files from disk, including encrypted zip files using a fixed password, and temporary files during decryption.",
  "sinks": "Reads files into memory; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads from disk -> decrypts zip files with fixed password -> loads file contents into memory; temporary files are created and cleaned up during decryption.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded password ('infected-test') for decrypting zip files; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for handling test data files, including encrypted zip files. It manages resources properly, with compatibility for older Python versions. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The fixed password is a security concern but acceptable within a testing context. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing purposes. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the hardcoded password, which is acceptable in a controlled testing environment. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
