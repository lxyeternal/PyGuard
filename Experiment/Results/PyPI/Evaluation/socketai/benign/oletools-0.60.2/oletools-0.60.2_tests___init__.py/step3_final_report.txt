  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code reviews, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall risk.",
  "sources": "No concrete code provided; assessments are based on high-level descriptions and summaries.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows can be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of concrete code limits anomaly detection; all reports note lack of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of concrete code, suspicious patterns, or malicious indicators. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the descriptions. Obfuscation scores are zero, reflecting no detected obfuscation. Risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), appropriate given the limited information. The only adjustment recommended is lowering Report 1's risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 to better reflect the absence of code. Overall, the assessments are cautious, justified, and consistent with the available data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustment to Report 1's risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 is recommended. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
