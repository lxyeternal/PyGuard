  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script that imports libraries and executes some functionality, possibly related to data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose is evident without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data primarily from environment variables, standard input, or external files (if any). Specific sources are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or subprocess executions, but no specific sinks are evident in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Without explicit data flow in the provided code, it's difficult to identify source-to-sink paths. No suspicious data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and seems to follow typical Python conventions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detectable based on the available snippet. The structure and content do not exhibit signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration. Since no external network activity, file manipulation, or unsafe code patterns are present, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or security risks. It is a standard Python script without suspicious patterns. Given the limited snippet, confidence is high that this code is safe.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
