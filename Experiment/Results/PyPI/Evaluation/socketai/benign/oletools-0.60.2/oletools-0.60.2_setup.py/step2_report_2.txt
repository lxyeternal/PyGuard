  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and typical package setup practices.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that this is a standard setup script for oletools, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. It notes the functions for recursive globbing are utility functions, and dependencies are standard.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical setup.py, reading README, defining package data, dependencies, and entry points. No untrusted data flows, no code execution based on external input, and no signs of malware.\n\n- **Malware, Obfuscated, Risk Scores:** The report assigns malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script is a setup/configuration script with no suspicious code or malicious intent. It highlights that no untrusted data is processed during runtime.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. The functions for package data inclusion are common utility functions.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, which aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes a typical setup.py for oletools, with no malicious behavior. Reads metadata, dependencies, and defines entry points.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, describes a standard package setup script with no malicious intent. Mentions standard practices and no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Assessment:** No network, no dynamic code, no handling of untrusted data. The utility functions for globbing are benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the script is a typical setup for oletools, managing dependencies and package data. No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no external commands.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of supply chain attack or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup.py script. The functions for recursive globbing are utility functions for including package data, not malicious code.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code, no code execution based on untrusted input, no network activity, no hidden payloads.\n\n- **Security Risk:** The script's purpose is to install and package the software; it does not perform runtime operations that could introduce security risks.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — Standard package setup with no security concerns.\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided in the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-maintained setup script for the oletools package. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. All scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
