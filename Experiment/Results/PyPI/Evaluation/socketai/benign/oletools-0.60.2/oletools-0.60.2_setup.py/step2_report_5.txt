  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard setup.py script for the oletools package.\n- The code reads metadata, package data, dependencies, and defines CLI entry points.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input during runtime is evident.\n- The functions for recursive globbing are utility functions for including package data files, common in setup scripts.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The script appears to follow best practices for Python packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a typical setup.py, with no issues in logic or structure.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Data leaks or data flows:** No untrusted data flows, leaks, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The commented-out code and detailed changelog indicate ongoing maintenance but do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, and this is appropriate. The script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious activity.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that the package setup script is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py for a Python package.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- No data leaks, backdoors, or supply chain risks are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe package setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify this as a benign setup script.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, consistent with the analysis.",
