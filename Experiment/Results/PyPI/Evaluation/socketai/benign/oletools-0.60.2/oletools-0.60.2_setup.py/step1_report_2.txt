{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup/configuration script used to install and distribute the oletools Python package, including its dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads from files such as 'oletools/README.rst' for long description, and reads the filesystem via os.listdir and open(). Also reads environment variables indirectly through package dependencies and setup configurations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the script mainly performs package setup, data gathering, and configuration tasks. No code executes untrusted input or writes sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The script reads metadata and package data sources, then uses setup() to install the package with specified dependencies, data, and entry points. No flow of untrusted data to critical sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code is standard for a Python package setup script, with comprehensive comments and a typical structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package (oletools). It reads static files for documentation, specifies package dependencies, and sets up entry points for CLI scripts. It includes functions for dynamically including package data files. No suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted input are present. The script follows typical packaging conventions and does not contain hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for the oletools package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It primarily manages package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware are detected.",
