  "purpose": "Setup script for the oletools Python package, facilitating installation, packaging, and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst file for long description, uses setup() parameters for package metadata, reads files from specific directories for package data, and imports modules for setup execution.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no untrusted data flows or data leaks detected within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads README.rst into 'long_desc' variable, gathers package data via glob functions, and passes data to setup() function; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code appears to follow standard packaging procedures. The commented-out code and detailed changelog indicate ongoing maintenance but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration using setuptools/distutils. It reads metadata and package data files, defines dependencies and entry points, and prepares the package for distribution. No suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions for recursive globbing are standard utility functions for including package data files. The dependency list includes standard security and analysis libraries. Overall, the code functions as intended for package setup without any malicious or malicious-like code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-maintained package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely manages dependencies and package data, with no anomalous or malicious code detected.",
