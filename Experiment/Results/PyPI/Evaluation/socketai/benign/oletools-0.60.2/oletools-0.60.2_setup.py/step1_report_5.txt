{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and installs the oletools Python package, managing dependencies, package data, and entry points for command-line tools used in malware analysis of Office and OLE files.",
  "sources": "Reads package files (e.g., README.rst, doc files), configuration data from the filesystem, and user environment (e.g., platform info).",
  "sinks": "Invokes setup() function to install packages, dependencies, and scripts; no untrusted data sinks detected that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Source files are read for long description and package data, then passed into setup() which manages installation; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code patterns. Usage of standard setup tools and package management routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, oletools, with detailed package metadata, dependency management, package data handling, and entry points for CLI scripts. It dynamically collects package data via glob functions, but these are benign utility functions. No code executes external commands, network connections, or manipulates untrusted input. The script is consistent with typical packaging workflows and contains no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It manages package installation and dependencies securely and transparently.",
