{
  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for the oletools Python package, used to configure package metadata, dependencies, package data, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from variables and files, defines package data inclusion via recursive glob functions, and specifies CLI scripts and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or runtime data sinks; no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input during runtime.",
  "flows": "Static package configuration data flows from variables and files into setup(), with no runtime untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions for recursive globbing are standard utility functions; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script for Python packaging. It reads static metadata, defines package data with recursive glob functions, and specifies dependencies and CLI entry points. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The functions for including package data are standard utility functions. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The overall structure follows best practices for Python package setup, and the code is straightforward and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risks or malicious intent, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk should be set to 0, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
