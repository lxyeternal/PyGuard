  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, logical flaws, or signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup.py configuration for the oletools package.\n- No reports identify any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The code is mainly concerned with package metadata, dependency declaration, package data inclusion, and CLI script setup.\n- Functions like `riglob` and `rglob` are utility functions for recursive globbing, common in setup scripts.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or runtime code execution involving external inputs are present.\n- The code appears well-maintained, with detailed changelogs and comments, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  **No.** The code is a typical setup script with no anomalies.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code follows standard practices, and no suspicious or incorrect logic is evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0 or 1 with high confidence, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Malware & Obfuscation Scores:\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which is consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The overall risk scores are also 0, indicating no security concern.\n\n### Potential Issues or Assumptions:\n\n- No suspicious assumptions are made in any report.\n- No code sections rely on untrusted inputs or perform dynamic code execution.\n- The only minor note is that the code is a setup script, which is inherently non-executable in a malicious way at runtime, especially when it only performs package configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0**; the package setup code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent are detected.\n- The functions for recursive globbing are benign utility functions.\n- Dependencies and entry points are standard for a Python package intended for malware analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0**       | No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks present. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard setup script for the oletools package with no malicious or security concern indicators.",
