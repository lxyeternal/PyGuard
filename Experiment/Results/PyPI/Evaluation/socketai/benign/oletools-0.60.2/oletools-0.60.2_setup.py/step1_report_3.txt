{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the oletools Python package, facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst for long description, imports setup functions, reads package metadata, and defines package data and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data. No network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> initializes setup() with package info and dependencies -> defines entry points for CLI scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs. The script dynamically loads dependencies and files, but this is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It imports setup functions, reads package metadata, defines package data and dependencies, and specifies CLI entry points. There are no network connections, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors. All dependencies and file inclusions are standard and explicitly declared. The script’s purpose is to facilitate installation, not runtime operation. The reading of README and dynamic inclusion of files are common in setup scripts. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script with no malicious intent. It properly declares dependencies and package data, and there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
