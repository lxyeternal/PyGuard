{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of unittests for a feature described as 'my cool new feature'. It appears to be a template or placeholder for testing functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or user input; no data sources are invoked within the provided code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs, such as network calls, file writes, or other data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the test functions are empty and do not perform any operations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains placeholder functions with 'pass' statements, indicating incomplete implementation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The comment about potentially uncommenting data directories is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unittest skeleton with no active code beyond imports and class/method definitions. It lacks any input handling, data processing, or external interactions. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues are evident. The structure is standard and clean, serving as a template for future tests.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, incomplete test scaffold with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a template for developing unit tests.",
