{
  "purpose": "A test suite for a new feature using Python's unittest framework",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only defines test methods and comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all functions are placeholders with no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out import statements and placeholder methods with no implementation. The comments suggest potential future data access but do not currently perform any actions.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a unittest-based test class with placeholder methods, no actual data processing or external data access is present. The code is minimal, mostly comments, and does not include any suspicious or malicious code. The only active code is the standard 'unittest.main()' invocation which is safe. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The comments indicate potential future features, but none are implemented or active.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test skeleton with no malicious or security-risk behavior. It is purely a structural setup for future testing. No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security issues.",
