{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of unit tests for a feature called 'my cool new feature'. It is intended for testing functionality with unittest framework in Python.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code comments mention optional import of test data but the import is commented out.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only stub test functions with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder functions with 'pass' statements and commented-out import, indicating incomplete or template code; no actual code execution or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic unittest skeleton for testing a feature, with no actual test logic implemented. It includes placeholder methods and comments about data directories, but no real data processing, external input, or suspicious behavior. The structure is standard and does not exhibit obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, incomplete test skeleton with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a template or early-stage development code with no active logic or data handling.",
