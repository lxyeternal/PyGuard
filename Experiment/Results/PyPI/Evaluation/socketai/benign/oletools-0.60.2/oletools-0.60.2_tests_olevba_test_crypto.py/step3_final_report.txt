  "purpose": "Unit test suite for verifying 'olevba' macro detection and decryption capabilities on encrypted Excel files.",
  "sources": "Reads test files from filesystem, invokes external 'olevba' command-line tool.",
  "sinks": "External command execution with test files, JSON parsing, assertions on output.",
  "flows": "Test files -> 'olevba' command -> JSON output -> assertions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured unit test suite that calls external tools to verify macro detection in encrypted Excel files. It does not process untrusted data beyond controlled test files, nor does it contain malicious or obfuscated code. External command invocation is standard for such testing, with no evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are justified given the controlled environment and purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing a security analysis tool, with no security risks or malware. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
