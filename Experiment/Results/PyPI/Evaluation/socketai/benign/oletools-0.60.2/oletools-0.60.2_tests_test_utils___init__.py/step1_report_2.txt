{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules 'utils' and 'testdata_reader' from the current package, likely for internal use within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package ('utils' and 'testdata_reader')",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements without execution flow or data handling",
  "anomalies": "Pure import statements with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements using relative imports, which is standard practice for internal module referencing. There are no signs of data handling, external communication, or malicious constructs. The absence of code execution, input handling, or data leaks suggests low risk. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet with standard import statements from internal modules. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
