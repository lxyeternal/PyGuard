  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code snippets, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All code snippets are simple import statements, mostly from local modules.\n- No data processing, external communication, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- Some reports mention wildcard imports ('*'), which are generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal code activity.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, standard imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate, benign, internal module imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, benign internal imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Notes wildcard import, which is a style concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.2 — acceptable, given the wildcard import.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just a style concern.\n\n**Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to report 4, wildcard import noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero, reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are generally low, but reports that mention wildcard imports could justify slightly higher scores due to potential for misuse or obfuscation, though in this context, it's more a style issue.\n- No report indicates any actual malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher for reports mentioning wildcard imports (reports 4 and 5), but overall low.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2, primarily due to wildcard import concerns but not actual security risks.\n\n**In conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores are reasonable, and no changes are necessary. The code snippets are standard import statements with no malicious intent or security issues.",
