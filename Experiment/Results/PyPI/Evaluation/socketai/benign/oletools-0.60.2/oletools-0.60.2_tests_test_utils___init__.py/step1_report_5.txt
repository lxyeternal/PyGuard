  "sources": "Import statements importing modules utils and testdata_reader.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or external data handling visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious or unintended code, but the import statements themselves are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements with wildcard syntax, which can be considered a security concern due to lack of explicitness and potential for hiding malicious imports. No other code, data handling, or external communications are present. Since the code does not perform any actions beyond importing, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is limited to importing modules with wildcard syntax, which is generally discouraged for clarity and security but does not in itself indicate malicious intent. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident from these import statements alone.",
