  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. Wildcard imports are a style concern but do not constitute a security threat. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could lower the risk score slightly if desired, but overall, the code is safe."
