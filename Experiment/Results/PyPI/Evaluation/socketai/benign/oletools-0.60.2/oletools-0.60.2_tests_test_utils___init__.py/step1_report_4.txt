{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and variables from two modules, utils and testdata_reader, likely for use in the main application or testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the utils and testdata_reader modules via import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided code; it does not process or handle data beyond imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this snippet, as it only contains import statements without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure the specific functions or variables imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic import operations from two local modules using wildcard imports. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing visible. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged because they can lead to namespace pollution, but they are not inherently malicious. The minimal code provided does not show any suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports is a code style concern but not a security issue in itself. Based solely on this code, there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
