  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippets, their descriptions, and the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Code:** `from .utils import *; from .testdata_reader import *`\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that these are internal module imports with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low).  \n**Conclusion:** The scoring seems appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Code:** Same as above, relative imports from internal modules.\n- **Assessment:** The report again finds no suspicious activity, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is perfect (1).  \n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Code:** Same import statements.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments, no malicious activity or obfuscation. Scores are again zero for malware and obfuscated, risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Code:** `from .utils import *; from .testdata_reader import *`\n- **Assessment:** The report notes that wildcard imports can obscure what is imported, which is a valid style concern but not inherently malicious. The scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.8.  \n**Analysis:** The risk score of 0.2 is justified given the wildcard import's potential to hide malicious code, but since there's no evidence of malicious activity, this is a conservative, precautionary score.  \n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Code:** Same as above.\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes that wildcard imports are discouraged but not malicious. The scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6.  \n**Analysis:** Given the minimal code and no evidence of malicious intent, the risk score could be slightly lowered to reflect the low actual threat, perhaps to 0.1. The confidence score is moderate, which is acceptable.  \n**Conclusion:** Slight adjustment to risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 could be more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that these are simple import statements, primarily internal, with no malicious behavior evident.\n- The use of wildcard imports in reports 4 and 5 is a style concern but not a security issue per se.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal threat.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly conservative but acceptable; for reports 4 and 5, consider lowering from 0.2 to 0.1 to better reflect the lack of actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to wildcard import concerns but no actual threat)\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, with a minor adjustment for the risk scores in reports 4 and 5.",
