{
  "purpose": "The code imports utility functions and test data reader modules, likely for supporting functionality within a larger application or testing framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: 'utils' and 'testdata_reader'. These are internal data sources or utility functions, not external inputs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in these lines.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to internal module imports; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements without any suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules, which is a standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The snippet is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for modular Python projects.",
