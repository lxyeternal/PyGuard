{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules 'utils' and 'testdata_reader' from the current package, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "The imports from local modules suggest internal data or functionality access, not external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file writes, or external data exposure are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows or source-to-sink paths in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements; no unusual or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements, which are standard in Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent. Given the simplicity, it appears to be standard module setup code with no embedded malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing standard internal imports without any malicious or suspicious activity.",
