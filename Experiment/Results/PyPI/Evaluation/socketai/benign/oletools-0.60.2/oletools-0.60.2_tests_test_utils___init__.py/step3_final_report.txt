  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; purely static import statements.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') in some snippets, which can obscure imported symbols but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no code execution, data handling, or network activity. Wildcard imports are used in some cases, which are discouraged for clarity and maintainability but do not pose security threats. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. Obfuscated scores are 0, given the straightforward import syntax. Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), primarily due to wildcard import usage, which is a style concern rather than a security issue. Confidence in these assessments is high (close to 1), as the code is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. Wildcard imports are a style concern but do not constitute a security threat. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could lower the risk score slightly if desired, but overall, the code is safe.",
