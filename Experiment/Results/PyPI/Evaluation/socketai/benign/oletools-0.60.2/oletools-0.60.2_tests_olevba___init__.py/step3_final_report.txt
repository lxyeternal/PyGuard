  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, imports, network calls, environment variables, dynamic execution points, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic calls or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Incomplete code, minimal comments, dynamic or obfuscated function calls, conditional logic that may conceal malicious intent, lack of code content.",
  "analysis": "All reports are based on incomplete or missing code snippets, limiting definitive conclusions. Reports 1, 3, and 4 correctly assign zero scores for malware and obfuscation, with low confidence due to missing content. Reports 2 and 5 thoroughly analyze available context, noting no evidence of malicious activity but mentioning potential obfuscation or suspicious patterns, leading to low to moderate risk scores (0.2) and high confidence (0.8). The scores are consistent with the observations, with slight room for adjustment if future code reveals obfuscation. Overall, the assessments are cautious, justified, and aligned with the evidence, with no significant anomalies or false positives.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are reasonable and consistent with the evidence (or lack thereof). No malicious activity or obfuscation is confirmed. Risk scores appropriately reflect uncertainty due to incomplete code. The overall security posture appears benign, and current scoring is justified.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
