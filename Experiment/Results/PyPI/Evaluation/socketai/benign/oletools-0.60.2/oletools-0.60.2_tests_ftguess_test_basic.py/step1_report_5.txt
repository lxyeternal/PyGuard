{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to run unit tests on the ftguess module to verify its file type guessing functionality based on file extensions and contents.",
  "sources": "Reads test data files from a test data directory and test utility modules; uses file contents from loop_over_files()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file writing, or environment variables are present",
  "flows": "Input files are read by loop_over_files() -> ftguess.ftype_guess() is called with file data -> test assertions compare guesses to expected types",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward test code",
  "analysis": "The code is a unit testing script utilizing the unittest framework. It imports the ftguess module and utility functions, then runs a series of tests to verify the accuracy of file type detection based on file extensions and content data. It uses predefined expected types for various filenames, including special handling for encrypted files and certain extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or code obfuscation. The code solely performs test automation without any hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for verifying the ftguess module. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates solely within the scope of testing file type detection and has no indicators of malicious intent.",
