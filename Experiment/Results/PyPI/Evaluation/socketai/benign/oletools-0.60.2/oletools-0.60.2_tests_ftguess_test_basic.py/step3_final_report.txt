{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit testing script for the 'ftguess' module from oletools, designed to verify the accuracy of file type guessing based on test files.",
  "sources": "The code reads test files via 'loop_over_files()' and the 'data' parameter passed to 'ftype_guess()'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input beyond test data, nor does it output data externally.",
  "flows": "The data flows from local test files through 'ftype_guess()', with results compared against expected values; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard unit tests on local test files, using 'ftype_guess()' to determine file types and asserting correctness based on filename extensions and specific cases. It contains no network activity, external data handling, or malicious operations. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The test data is controlled and local, and the logic is typical for such testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit testing script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and overall security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
