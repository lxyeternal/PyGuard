  "conclusion": "The most accurate report is the one that correctly balances suspicion with evidence, which is consistent with the current assessments. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 2 to 0.3 and the risk to 0.4 could better reflect potential concerns if further investigation confirms suspicious network activity. Otherwise, all reports are reasonable and well-aligned with the evidence."
