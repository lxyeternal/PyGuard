  "purpose": "Defines a Python class with a nested Media class specifying static JS and CSS asset paths, typical for static media inclusion in Django.",
  "sources": "Static asset paths within the Media class; no data input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static references only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static asset declaration with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. It contains no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is appropriately zero, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is zero, reflecting the safe static configuration. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code's static, non-executable nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
