  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a class with a nested Media class specifying static JS and CSS files.\n- No input handling, data processing, dynamic code execution, or external data sources are involved.\n- The code is a typical pattern in Django for including static assets.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign and safe.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the code is static asset declaration with no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The conclusion aligns with the code's static nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Correctly interprets the code as static asset declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9 — slightly lower confidence but still reasonable.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning remains valid; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static asset configuration with no malicious or security issues.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero in all cases.\n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected or claimed.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this review, I would agree with the existing scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The code is a simple static asset declaration with no potential for harm.",
