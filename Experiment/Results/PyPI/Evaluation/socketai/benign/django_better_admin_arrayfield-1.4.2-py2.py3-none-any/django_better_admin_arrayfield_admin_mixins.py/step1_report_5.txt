  "purpose": "Defines a mixin class for dynamic array functionality with associated media assets (JavaScript and CSS files).",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static asset declarations do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a class with static references to media files (JavaScript and CSS). There are no input handling, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The media assets are standard static references typical in web development frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign class definition for including static media assets in a web application. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
