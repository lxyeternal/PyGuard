  "purpose": "Define a mixin class for dynamic array handling with associated media assets (JavaScript and CSS files).",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and only defines static assets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition with a nested class specifying static media assets (JS and CSS files). There are no input sources, no data processing, no untrusted data sinks, nor any dynamic code execution. The structure appears typical for static asset declarations in Django or similar frameworks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static asset configuration for a Django application. There is no malicious intent or security risk identified.",
