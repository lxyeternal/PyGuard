  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'DynamicArrayMixin' with an inner 'Media' class that specifies static media files (JavaScript and CSS) for a Django admin customization. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard way to include media assets for a Django form or admin interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely consists of static class attributes used for frontend media inclusion. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
