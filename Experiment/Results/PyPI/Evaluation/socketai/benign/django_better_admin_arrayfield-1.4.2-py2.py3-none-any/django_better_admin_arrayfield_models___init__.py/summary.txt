  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity but contains features (obfuscation, dynamic execution) that warrant cautious scoring. The most suspicious report (Report 4) merits a higher malware suspicion score due to obfuscation and dynamic code, while others are benign. Adjustments to scores are recommended to better align with observed features, especially increasing malware suspicion in Report 4 from 0.3 to 0.5."
