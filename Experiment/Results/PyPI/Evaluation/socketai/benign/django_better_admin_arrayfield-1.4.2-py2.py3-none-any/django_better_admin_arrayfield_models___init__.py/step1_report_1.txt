  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit main logic or obvious application-specific purpose.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, input functions, or external data files if present, but none are explicitly visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve network connections, file writes, or data leaks, but the code does not show any direct use of such sinks.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are observable within the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code are evident. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard function definitions, imports, and class declarations typical in Python modules. No network activity, system modifications, or suspicious patterns are present. It does not perform any operations that could be linked to malicious intent. The absence of obfuscation, hidden imports, or unusual control flow supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in nature.",
