  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or transformation, but without specific comments or context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from variables, function parameters, or possibly external files or inputs (if present). No explicit input sources are identified in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions like print(), writing to files, network requests, or database operations, depending on the code. No explicit sink operations are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various functions or operations, possibly resulting in output or side effects. Specific flow paths cannot be determined without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is either missing or not provided in the prompt. Therefore, a thorough step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Based on the absence of code, no malicious patterns or security issues are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for analysis, so no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The code appears benign or absent.",
