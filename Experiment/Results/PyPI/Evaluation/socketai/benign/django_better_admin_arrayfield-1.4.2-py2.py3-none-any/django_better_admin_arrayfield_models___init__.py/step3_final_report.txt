  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points such as network requests, file reads, environment variables, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication functions, file modifications, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into network calls, file writes, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution features, which are indicative of potential malicious intent. No explicit malicious actions such as data theft or system damage are confirmed, but the obfuscation and dynamic code suggest possible concealment of malicious behavior. The absence of code in some reports limits analysis, but where present, suspicious patterns are noted. The scores reflect these observations, with higher malware suspicion linked to obfuscation and dynamic features.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity but contains features (obfuscation, dynamic execution) that warrant cautious scoring. The most suspicious report (Report 4) merits a higher malware suspicion score due to obfuscation and dynamic code, while others are benign. Adjustments to scores are recommended to better align with observed features, especially increasing malware suspicion in Report 4 from 0.3 to 0.5.",
