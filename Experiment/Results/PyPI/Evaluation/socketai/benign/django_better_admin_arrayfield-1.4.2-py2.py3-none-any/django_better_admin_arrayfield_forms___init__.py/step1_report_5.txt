{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs data processing and possibly interacts with external systems or inputs.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading from files, environment variables, or user input), external data sources or APIs",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points such as network calls, file writes, or system commands that could handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions and potentially reaches sinks that could cause security issues",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures. Unusual use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns not detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and utilizes standard Python libraries and functions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network connections are apparent. The logic flows naturally, with no signs of data exfiltration or backdoors. Absence of obfuscated code or unusual language features reduces suspicion. Without additional context or external dependencies, the risk appears minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform typical data processing tasks without suspicious intent.",
