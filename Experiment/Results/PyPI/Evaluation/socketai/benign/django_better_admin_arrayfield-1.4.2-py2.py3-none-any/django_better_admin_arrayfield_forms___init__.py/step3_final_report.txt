  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network calls, dynamic code execution points, import statements.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) to sinks (network, system commands) via code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic eval/exec usage, suspicious imports, network activity, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with network communication patterns suggestive of data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials are observed, but obfuscation and suspicious imports raise concern. Absence of code in some reports limits definitive conclusions, but the suspicion in report 1 is supported by described patterns. Benign reports show straightforward code with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains potentially malicious obfuscated code with dynamic execution and network activity, warranting further investigation. Other reports are benign. The overall malware score is around 0.35, obfuscation around 0.3, and security risk approximately 0.25, reflecting the suspicion level in report 1 but acknowledging the benign nature of most code.",
