  "purpose": "Custom Django form widgets for dynamic array inputs, enabling rendering and handling of list data in forms.",
  "sources": "Input data received via form submissions through data dictionary (data parameter in value_from_datadict).",
  "sinks": "Processed data returned from value_from_datadict, used internally in form processing. No external network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from data.getlist (or data.get) to return a list of non-empty values, passing through format_value. No external sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard Django forms with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and typical for form widget customization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom form widgets extending Django's TextInput and Textarea, supporting dynamic arrays. It constructs subwidgets for each item in the array and manages context for rendering. Data extraction occurs via getlist or fallback to get, with no suspicious data handling or external communication. No hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior detected. The structure and methods adhere to Django standards, with no anomalies or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate custom widgets for handling dynamic array inputs in Django forms. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or supply chain attacks. It is safe based on this analysis.",
