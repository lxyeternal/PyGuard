  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. Standard widget logic.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.  \n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard data handling, no obfuscation. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) due to the nature of dynamic widgets, but still minimal.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.  \n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to above, no malicious behavior, standard practices, no obfuscation. Slightly lower confidence (0.95).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent.  \n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard Django widget patterns, safe data handling. Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, standard widget code, safe practices.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.  \n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in some reports, justified by the dynamic nature of the widget, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n\n### Logical Consistency and Recommendations:\n\n- The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.  \n- The data handling is standard, with proper use of Django's form widget methods.  \n- The potential for security risk stems from dynamic widget rendering, but this alone does not constitute a significant risk, especially since no external calls or insecure data handling are present.  \n- The scores assigned across reports are consistent and reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to dynamic widget complexity, but no real security threat.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard implementation of custom Django form widgets for dynamic array inputs. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is evident. The small security risk score is justified by the dynamic nature but does not indicate a real vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The overall security posture of this code is safe, with no supply chain or malicious concerns.",
