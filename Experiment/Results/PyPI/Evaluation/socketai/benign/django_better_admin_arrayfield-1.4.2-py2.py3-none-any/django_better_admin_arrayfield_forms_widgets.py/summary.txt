  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Django custom widget for dynamic array inputs. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The slight security risk score is justified by the dynamic data handling but does not represent a real threat. All reports are accurate, and the overall security assessment is that the code is safe with negligible risk."
