  "purpose": "Custom Django form widget for dynamically handling array-like input fields with subwidgets.",
  "sources": "Input data from form submissions via data dictionary in value_from_datadict.",
  "sinks": "Potentially problematic if untrusted data is directly used without validation, such as in format_value or get_context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (via data dict) through value_from_datadict, and is rendered in get_context using subwidgets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls observed. Use of dynamic widget creation is typical in custom form widgets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom Django form widgets, primarily for rendering and processing array-like fields with subwidgets (e.g., text inputs or textareas). It manages context for rendering, dynamically generates subwidgets, and handles form data extraction. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The data handling appears to follow standard Django practices. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or unsafe code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom widget implementation for Django forms, with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected. It functions to support dynamic array inputs in forms and does not pose supply chain or security threats.",
