  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It correctly identifies that the widget manages dynamic arrays with subwidgets, handling context and data extraction appropriately.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Justification:** No issues found; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it concludes the code is legitimate, with no malicious activity or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight securityRisk score seems to reflect a conservative approach, but given no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior are detected, this is acceptable.\n\n- **Justification:** The code appears safe; the small securityRisk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also finds the code legitimate, standard Django widget practices, no malicious behavior, and no anomalies.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The handling of data is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — again, a conservative minor risk score, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Justification:** The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard custom widget implementation, no signs of malicious code or security risks.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and structure, the risk score should be very low, close to 0. The minor 0.1 scores assigned are conservative but acceptable, considering no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.05** — minimal risk, primarily due to the nature of dynamic data handling, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom Django form widgets for dynamic array inputs. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure future code reviews include static analysis for potential injection points or unsafe data handling, but in this case, the code appears safe.",
