  "purpose": "Define custom Django form widgets for dynamically rendering and handling arrays of text inputs or textareas in admin interfaces.",
  "sources": "Reading from the form data dictionary (data.getlist, data.get), reading widget attributes and context during rendering.",
  "sinks": "Returning processed list data from value_from_datadict, accessing form context for rendering.",
  "flows": "Input data (from form submissions) flows through value_from_datadict to return list of values; context data flows during rendering to generate subwidgets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or hidden behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard Django form widget mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom widgets for dynamic array inputs in Django forms, utilizing standard Django form widget methods. get_context constructs subwidgets for each array element, and value_from_datadict retrieves list values. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no backdoors, or suspicious logic present. The widget uses safe Django patterns and the only notable behavior is rendering multiple subwidgets and processing their data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of custom form widgets for dynamic array inputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for enhancing form input capabilities.",
