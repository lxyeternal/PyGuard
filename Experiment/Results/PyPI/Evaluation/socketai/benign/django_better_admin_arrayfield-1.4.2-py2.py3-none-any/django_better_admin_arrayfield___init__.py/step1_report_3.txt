{
  "purpose": "Defines the package version and sets the default Django app configuration for the 'django_better_admin_arrayfield' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string '__version__' and the string assigning 'default_app_config'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no data leaks or malicious effect points.",
  "flows": "The source '__version__' is a simple string assignment with no flow to sinks, and 'default_app_config' is a straightforward assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscation, hidden code, or hardcoded secrets beyond versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of minimal, standard package metadata assignments. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The version string and app config assignment are typical in Python packages. No malicious or anomalous patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only straightforward metadata declarations typical for a Django package. No malicious intent or security issues are present.",
