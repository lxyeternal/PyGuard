  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them with the original code.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"1.4.2\"\ndefault_app_config = \"django_better_admin_arrayfield.apps.DjangoBetterAdminArrayfieldConfig\"\n```\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- The code simply assigns a version string to `__version__`.\n- It assigns a string representing the default app configuration class to `default_app_config`.\n- Both are static, straightforward assignments typical for Python packages, especially Django apps.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external data interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Common themes across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, benign, and serves typical package configuration purposes.\n- No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or signs of obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward static assignments.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The logic is sound; static assignments of version info and app config are inherently low risk.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the assessments are appropriate.\n- The scores seem reasonable and justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- **Risk assessment:** The code is benign; no further action needed.\n- **Additional notes:** If future code introduces dynamic behavior or external data handling, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n**The code is a minimal, standard package configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.**",
