  "purpose": "The code defines package version and Django app configuration as static string assignments, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading static string assignments for __version__ and default_app_config.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "Static assignments without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package version and Django app configuration, typical in Django projects. No dynamic code, input, or external data is involved. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and static nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1) due to the clear, static assignments. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
