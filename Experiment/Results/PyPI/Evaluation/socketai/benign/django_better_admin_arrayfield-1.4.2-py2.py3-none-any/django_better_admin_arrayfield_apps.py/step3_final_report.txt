  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with a specified app name.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only declares a class and a string attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Malformed encoding declaration line (`# -*- coding: utf-8`) missing closing quote or newline; a formatting typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Django AppConfig subclass with a name attribute. The only issue is a malformed encoding comment, which is a syntax or formatting mistake but does not impact execution or security. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The malformed encoding line is a minor formatting issue that does not constitute a security concern. Overall, the code is safe, standard, and free of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django configuration class with a minor formatting typo in the encoding declaration. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no further action is necessary.",
