  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration for the 'django_better_admin_arrayfield' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for django.apps and the class definition that inherits from AppConfig.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform IO operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only defines a configuration class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard Django app configuration without any obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's AppConfig class and defines a new configuration class for a Django app called 'django_better_admin_arrayfield'. The class only sets the app's name attribute. There are no data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data handling. No dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward, typical of Django applications, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django application configuration class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely registers the app with Django's configuration system.",
