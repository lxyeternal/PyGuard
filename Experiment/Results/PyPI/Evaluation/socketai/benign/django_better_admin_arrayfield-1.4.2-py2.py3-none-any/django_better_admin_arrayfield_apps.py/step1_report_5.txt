  "flows": "No data flow exists from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Django AppConfig subclass that sets the app name. It only imports Django's AppConfig and declares a class with a name attribute. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django application configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
