  "purpose": "This code customizes a Django PostgreSQL ArrayField to use a specific form field (DynamicArrayField) in forms.",
  "sources": "Importing Django's ArrayField and a custom form field from django_better_admin_arrayfield.",
  "sinks": "The formfield method uses super() to generate a form field, passing in a form_class argument.",
  "flows": "The formfield method calls the parent class's formfield, injecting a custom form_class which is DynamicArrayField.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Usage of third-party packages appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a Django model field, overriding formfield() to specify a custom form class for admin forms. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The imported packages are standard for Django and a known third-party package. The override method correctly passes kwargs to the superclass, replacing the form class with a custom implementation. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward subclass modification to specify a custom form field for an ArrayField. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a benign customization intended for improved admin interface behavior.",
