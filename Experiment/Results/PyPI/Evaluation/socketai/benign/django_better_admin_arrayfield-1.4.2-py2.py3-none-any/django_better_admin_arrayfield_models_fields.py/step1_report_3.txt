{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Django model field that extends the PostgreSQL ArrayField to use a custom form field for better admin interface integration.",
  "sources": "Imports Django's PostgreSQL ArrayField and a custom form field from django_better_admin_arrayfield.",
  "sinks": "The formfield method returns a form class, potentially influenced by untrusted input if kwargs are manipulated, but no untrusted data is processed here.",
  "flows": "The ArrayField class provides a formfield method that specifies a form class, which could influence form behavior but does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code appears straightforward, extending existing classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django and third-party modules to extend the functionality of a PostgreSQL ArrayField. The class overrides the formfield method to specify a custom form class (DynamicArrayField), which enhances the admin interface. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leaks, or backdoors. The code appears to be a simple extension of existing frameworks without any suspicious logic or handling of untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension intended for customizing form behavior in Django admin. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
