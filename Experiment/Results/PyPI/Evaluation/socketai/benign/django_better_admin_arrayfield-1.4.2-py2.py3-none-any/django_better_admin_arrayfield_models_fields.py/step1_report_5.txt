  "sources": "Import statements for Django's PostgreSQL ArrayField and a custom form field from django_better_admin_arrayfield.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or untrusted input handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class extension with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's ArrayField, overriding the formfield method to specify a custom form class. The import statements are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The class enhances the admin interface but does not process or handle untrusted data. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or external data flows that could suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign extension of a Django model field for improved admin interface usability. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
