{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom ArrayField class that extends Django's PostgreSQL ArrayField to use a dynamic form field in Django admin.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from Django model definitions and form rendering functions, specifically during form field creation.",
  "sinks": "The formfield method creates a form class, but there are no direct sinks for untrusted data or execution here.",
  "flows": "The class modifies the formfield method to replace the default form class with DynamicArrayField, influencing form behavior during form rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard inheritance and method overriding without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's ArrayField and overrides the formfield method to specify a custom form class (DynamicArrayField). This pattern is common in customizing Django admin forms. There are no hardcoded secrets, input/output streams, or code execution points. The code simply extends existing classes and overrides a method to customize form behavior, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard customization of a Django model field for admin forms. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for customizing form display.",
