  "purpose": "The code extends Django's ArrayField to override the formfield method, specifying a custom form class (DynamicArrayField) for admin interface customization.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.contrib.postgres.fields and django_better_admin_arrayfield.forms.fields; usage of ArrayField and DynamicArrayField within the class.",
  "sinks": "The formfield method influences form rendering; no untrusted data sources or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The class overrides formfield() to inject DynamicArrayField into form rendering; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward subclassing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard subclass of Django's ArrayField, customizing the form class used in admin forms. It imports necessary modules, overrides formfield() to specify DynamicArrayField, and does not process untrusted data or perform network operations. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign customization, and the implementation is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension for customizing Django admin forms with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect a safe, straightforward pattern, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0-0.1) due to minimal potential for indirect issues.",
