      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Django custom widget for dynamic array inputs. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The slight security risk score is justified by the dynamic data handling but does not represent a real threat. All reports are accurate, and the overall security assessment is that the code is safe with negligible risk."

      "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity but contains features (obfuscation, dynamic execution) that warrant cautious scoring. The most suspicious report (Report 4) merits a higher malware suspicion score due to obfuscation and dynamic code, while others are benign. Adjustments to scores are recommended to better align with observed features, especially increasing malware suspicion in Report 4 from 0.3 to 0.5."
