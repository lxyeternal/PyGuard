{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Django form field for handling dynamic array inputs with validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from form input through the 'value' parameter in the 'clean' method.",
  "sinks": "Potential data processing occurs within the 'clean' method, mainly data validation and cleanup.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'value' into validation in 'clean', then is processed and possibly raises ValidationError.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of third-party 'prefix_validation_error' and 'DynamicArrayWidget' is standard; no unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom form field for handling array inputs in Django. It validates each item using the provided 'base_field' and manages errors with proper error messages. No untrusted data sources or dangerous operations are present. The use of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system commands, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Django form field for dynamic arrays, with proper validation and error handling. It does not contain malicious intent or malicious code patterns. The overall security risk is very low.",
