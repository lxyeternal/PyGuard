      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation, contacts suspicious external domains during installation, and contains undefined functions, all of which raise security concerns. While no direct malicious payloads are present, the external DNS resolution and obfuscation suggest potential for malicious activity, warranting cautious handling and further investigation."

      "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with appropriate low scores; Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and potential risk but lacks concrete malicious activity. Slightly reducing the malware score in Report 2 improves accuracy. Overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable, indicating low overall security risk with some caution needed for suspicious patterns."
