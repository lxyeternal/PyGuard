  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation, contacts suspicious external domains during installation, and contains undefined functions, all of which raise security concerns. While no direct malicious payloads are present, the external DNS resolution and obfuscation suggest potential for malicious activity, warranting cautious handling and further investigation."
