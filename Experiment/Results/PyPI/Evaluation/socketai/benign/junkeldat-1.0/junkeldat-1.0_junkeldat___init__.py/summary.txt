  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with appropriate low scores; Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and potential risk but lacks concrete malicious activity. Slightly reducing the malware score in Report 2 improves accuracy. Overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable, indicating low overall security risk with some caution needed for suspicious patterns."
