  "sources": "No clear sources of input or data are identifiable within the provided snippet, as the code appears empty or minimal.",
  "sinks": "There are no identifiable sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are observable, likely due to the absence of substantive code.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is empty or incomplete; there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected within the provided content.",
  "analysis": "The code provided contains no executable statements or data handling. Without actual code, it is impossible to identify any malicious activity, obfuscated logic, or security issues. The structure is missing, and there are no source, sink, or flow patterns to analyze. This suggests either an incomplete snippet or an intentionally blank file.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The absence of code makes a thorough security assessment impossible; thus, no threats can be identified from this fragment.",
