      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured version management utility used in Python projects. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. The potential security risks are typical of build scripts executing external commands and modifying files, which are standard practices but should be used with trusted environments. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal."
