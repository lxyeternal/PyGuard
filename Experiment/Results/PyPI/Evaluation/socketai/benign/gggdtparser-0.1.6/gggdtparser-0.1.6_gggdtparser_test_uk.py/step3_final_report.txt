  "purpose": "The code contains only comments with author info, email, date, and timestamps in multiple languages, serving as metadata or documentation.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static comments present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no executable code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comments in multiple languages and timestamps, but no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is purely comments with no executable logic, data input/output, or code flow. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The comments are in multiple languages, which is unusual but not suspicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no malicious activity. Confidence is high (1), given the clear absence of executable content. No anomalies or suspicious signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, containing only metadata comments, with no indication of malicious activity or security issues. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
