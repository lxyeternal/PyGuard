{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to manage language configurations, compile regex patterns, load language modules, and organize translation data.",
  "sources": "File system (glob to list language files), importlib to load modules, and regex compilation for language-specific patterns.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; code does not perform any data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Language file discovery -> Module import -> Attribute checks -> Regex compilation -> Data structure organization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code performs typical configuration loading and regex processing. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines regex patterns, and loads language-specific modules dynamically. It compiles regex patterns and organizes translation data into dictionaries, applying sorting. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present. The operations are typical for configuration setup and internationalization support. No signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration and utility module for managing language translation patterns. It performs safe operations such as regex compilation and module importation without any malicious intent or malicious behavior. No security issues or malware signs are identified.",
