{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a language processing utility that loads language-specific regex patterns and translation mappings from files and modules, and organizes them for later use in text processing or translation tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads language files (*.py) from the 'langs' directory and imports modules dynamically; it also reads the current file path and the contents of imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs involving untrusted input are present; the code primarily loads and processes static files and modules.",
  "flows": "Language files are loaded, filtered, and imported; regex patterns and translation mappings are compiled and stored in dictionaries for later use.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The code dynamically imports language modules but does so in a standard manner. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes constants and configurations related to language processing. It loads language modules from a specific directory, compiles regex patterns defined in those modules, and sorts the resulting dictionaries. The process appears to be for organizing language-specific regex patterns and translation mappings, with no evident malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The use of dynamic import and regex compilation is standard for such applications. There are no backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activities evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward language resource loader and organizer with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It appears to serve a utility function within a language processing system, with no security risks detected.",
