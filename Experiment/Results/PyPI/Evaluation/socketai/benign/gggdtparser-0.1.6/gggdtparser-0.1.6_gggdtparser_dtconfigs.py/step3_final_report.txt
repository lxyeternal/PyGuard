{
  "purpose": "Load language-specific regex and translation mappings from local modules for language processing.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory 'langs' where language modules are stored; importlib dynamically loads modules from this directory.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network or file write operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Filesystem reads -> importlib import -> regex compilation and storage in dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard plugin/module loading pattern; no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code loads language modules dynamically from a local directory, compiles regex patterns, and organizes translation mappings. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute code beyond standard module imports. The dynamic import pattern is common in plugin systems but could pose risks if the 'langs' directory is compromised. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The regex compilation and module loading are straightforward and safe in controlled environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard language resource loader with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the 'langs' directory, as dynamic import from filesystem can be exploited if compromised. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured for its purpose.",
