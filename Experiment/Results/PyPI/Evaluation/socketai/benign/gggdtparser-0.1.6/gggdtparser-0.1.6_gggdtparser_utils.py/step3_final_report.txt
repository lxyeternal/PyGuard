  "purpose": "Utility functions for dictionary sorting and string-to-datetime conversion, used for data manipulation within larger codebases.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'd' (dictionary), 's' (string), and 'format_list' (list of datetime formats).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; functions process data in-memory without external or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions: 'd' to sorted dictionary, 's' through multiple datetime formats until successful parse.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with version-dependent syntax, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two utility functions: 'get_sort_dict' sorts a dictionary based on a provided key list, handling Python >=3.9 with the '|' operator, and older versions with update(). 's2dt' attempts to parse a string into datetime using multiple formats, returning on first success. Both functions operate solely on input parameters, with no external data, network, or file I/O. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The functions are standard, safe utilities with correct implementation. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard utility operations, and poses no security threats or malicious intent. The assessments and scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and justified.",
