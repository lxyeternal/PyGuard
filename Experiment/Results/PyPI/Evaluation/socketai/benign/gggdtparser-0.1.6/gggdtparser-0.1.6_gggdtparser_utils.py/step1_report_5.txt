{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for dictionary sorting and string-to-datetime conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads function arguments 'd', 'sort_list', 's', and 'format_list'; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, processed locally with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code uses standard libraries with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: get_sort_dict sorts a dictionary based on an optional list of keys, using different syntax depending on Python version; s2dt converts a string to a datetime object using multiple formats. Both functions perform straightforward, safe operations with no external network calls, no data leakage, and no suspicious behavior. No input validation beyond normal exception handling is present, which is typical for such utility functions. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign utility functions for sorting dictionaries and parsing datetime strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The implementation is standard and safe.",
