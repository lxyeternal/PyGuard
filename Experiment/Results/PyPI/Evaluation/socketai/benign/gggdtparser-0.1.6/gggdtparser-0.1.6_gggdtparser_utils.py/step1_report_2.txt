  "purpose": "Utility functions for dictionary sorting and string-to-datetime conversion",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'd' (dictionary), 'sort_list' (list), 's' (string), 'format_list' (list)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output observed",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions: 'd' and 'sort_list' into get_sort_dict, 's' and 'format_list' into s2dt",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; no obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions without any external data fetch, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. get_sort_dict sorts a dictionary based on a provided list of keys, considering Python version differences, while s2dt attempts to parse a string into datetime objects with multiple formats. Both functions are straightforward and do not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module with no malicious or suspicious features. It performs safe, common operations and does not pose any security threats.",
