  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for sorting dictionaries and converting strings to datetime objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; only operates on function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks, as functions operate solely on provided arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script defines two functions: 'get_sort_dict' which sorts dictionaries based on an optional list, using different syntax for Python >=3.9 and earlier versions; 's2dt' which attempts to parse a string into a datetime object using multiple formats. No external input handling, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
