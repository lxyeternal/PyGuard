  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for dictionary sorting and string-to-datetime conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters (d, s, format_list).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to external systems or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters into functions and is processed locally; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual code behaviors. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: get_sort_dict sorts a dictionary based on a provided list of keys, with different implementation for Python >= 3.9 and earlier versions. s2dt attempts to parse a string into a datetime object using multiple formats. Both functions process input data locally and do not perform network operations, system modifications, or handle untrusted external data sources beyond function parameters. No suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data processing with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or malware within this fragment.",
