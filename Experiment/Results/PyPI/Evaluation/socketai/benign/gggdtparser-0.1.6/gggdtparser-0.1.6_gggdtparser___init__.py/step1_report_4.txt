  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific functions from internal submodules for data parsing and frame parsing, likely part of a larger data processing library.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are directly present in this snippet; the code only imports functions from other modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet; it solely contains import statements.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows within this snippet since it only imports functions, and no data processing or execution occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in this code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement module with no data input, processing, or output. It imports parsing functions from internal modules. No malicious behavior, malware, or security issues are detectable in this isolated snippet. The structure is standard for Python modules, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module import statement with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger data parsing library. Given only this snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior.",
