{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports functions from local submodules for parsing data and frames.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or external data reading; only imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; just function imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements and metadata comments; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script defines metadata and imports specific functions from local modules, likely part of a larger package. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. It appears straightforward and standard for a Python package module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import module with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks detected. It seems safe and typical for a Python package's internal structure.",
