  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippets are only import statements, with no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, which aligns with the actual code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code snippets.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is simple import statements with no malicious behavior.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any suspicious activity or potential vulnerabilities that would warrant a higher score.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention that the code is part of a larger package. While true, this does not impact the security assessment of this specific snippet.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities based on the code provided.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimates align with the reports:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple, standard import module with no security issues. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
