  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules (.dtparser and .dtframe).\n- No external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup for a larger package.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.5; the highest is 0.5, which is still low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**Critical review:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough in their reasoning.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign and part of a larger package.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Given the code's simplicity and the evidence, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- No changes are necessary; the scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is a benign, straightforward import module with no security concerns. It is typical for internal package setup, and no further action is needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.\n\n**Work out the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
