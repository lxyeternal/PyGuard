  "purpose": "Import specific functions from local modules for data parsing and processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules (.dtparser and .dtframe).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "Code only contains import statements with no suspicious or unusual elements. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules related to data parsing. There are no input or output operations, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The file appears to be part of a larger package, serving as an import module. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import module with no malicious or suspicious elements. It simply imports functions from other local modules for use elsewhere, with no security risks identified.",
