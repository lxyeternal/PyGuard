{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup for a Python package/module named 'gggdtparser'.",
  "sources": "The 'setuptools.setup()' function, which reads the 'py_modules' parameter specifying 'gggdtparser'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network, file, or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Input data (package configuration) flows into setup() but does not flow into any sinks or malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with a single parameter 'py_modules' indicating the module 'gggdtparser'. It contains author metadata in comments but no runtime logic. No data inputs, network activities, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a standard package setup script. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a simple, standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
