  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package/module named 'gggdtparser' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import setuptools' and the call to 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "sinks": "The setup configuration does not include data sinks like network or file operations; it only declares a module to be installed.",
  "flows": "Import of setuptools leads to package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with a simple py_modules argument. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The script appears to be a straightforward package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
