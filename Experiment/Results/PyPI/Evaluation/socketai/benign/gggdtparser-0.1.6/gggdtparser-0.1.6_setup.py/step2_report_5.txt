  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same minimal setup script that imports `setuptools` and calls `setup()` with a `py_modules` argument.\n- No input sources, data sinks, or data flows involving untrusted sources are present.\n- No code execution, network activity, or dynamic behavior is detected.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for packaging, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Confirmation:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, benign setup script. There are no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  **None.** All reports consistently conclude the script is benign, with appropriate reasoning based on static analysis.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the code's straightforward nature.  \n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign very low scores (0 or 0.1). Given the lack of any suspicious behavior, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- **Are any risk scores higher than justified?**  \n  No. The scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- All reports assume that because the code is static and minimal, it is safe. This is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:**  \n  **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:**  \n  **0.1** — very low, reflecting the minimal risk of supply chain issues in such a setup script.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
