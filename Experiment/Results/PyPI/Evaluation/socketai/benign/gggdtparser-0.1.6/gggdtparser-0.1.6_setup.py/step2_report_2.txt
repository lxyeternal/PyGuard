  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a minimal Python setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with a 'py_modules' argument.\n- No input sources, data sinks, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are identified.\n- The code is standard for packaging a Python module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. There are no indications of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  None. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or 0.1. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, a score of 0 is justified. The small 0.1 might reflect minimal inherent risk in package setup scripts, but this is negligible.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (more accurate than 0.1, given no issues)\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code itself, **the package setup script is entirely benign**. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious activity or code present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and standard.               |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.    |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe Python packaging script with no security concerns.",
