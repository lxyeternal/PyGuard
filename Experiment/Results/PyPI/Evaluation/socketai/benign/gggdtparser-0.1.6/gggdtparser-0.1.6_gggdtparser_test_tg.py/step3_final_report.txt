  "purpose": "The code snippet is a simple header comment containing author info, email, date, and a Cyrillic comment indicating '33 minutes ago.' It contains no executable code or data handling.",
  "sources": "Metadata comments, author info, email, date, and a timestamp comment in Cyrillic.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code contains only comments.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; only static comments present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a non-English comment in Cyrillic, which is benign and not indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments with no executable logic, data input/output, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the content. The Cyrillic comment is a timestamp or note, not an anomaly or malicious indicator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, consisting only of comments and metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports are accurate and require no modifications.",
