  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- It contains only comments: encoding declaration, author info, email, date, and a comment in Cyrillic (\"33 дақиқалар аввал\" meaning \"33 minutes ago\").\n- No executable code, data input/output, or data flow.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code contains only comments with no executable logic. They do not claim any malicious code or vulnerabilities, which aligns with the actual content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They note the absence of code, data flows, or malicious behavior, and mention the non-English comment as benign. No mistakes are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 1 with high confidence (1.0). This is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code contains only comments, there is no malware activity. The malware score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The presence of non-ASCII comments does not imply obfuscation. Obfuscation involves code hiding or encoding, which is not present here. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  No security risks are present in purely comment-based code. The risk score should be **0**.\n\n- **Any assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they simply state the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable in their assessments. The code snippet is purely a comment header with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
