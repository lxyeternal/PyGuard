  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign cron scheduler with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The minor flaw in the rounding function does not affect security. The reported scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
