{
  "purpose": "This code imports three modules related to scheduling, validation, and regex patterns, likely as part of a larger package. It does not perform any operations or contain executable logic.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves are the sources, as they load modules from local files.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet, as it does not process data or execute functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only imports modules without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements from local modules, indicating a modular structure. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minimal nature of the code suggests it is benign, serving as part of a larger application. No external input, network activity, or data handling occurs here. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with this assessment. Given the lack of any suspicious activity or complexity, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import section with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores should be set to zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
