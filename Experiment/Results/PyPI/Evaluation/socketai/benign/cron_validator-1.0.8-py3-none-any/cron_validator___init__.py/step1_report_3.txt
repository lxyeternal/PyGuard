  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; only importing modules",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static references",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import statements with relative paths",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules within the package. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are referenced. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. These are typical module imports, which are safe in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard import statement segment with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious intent.",
