  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and converting datetime strings, timestamps, and handling time zones, with some text processing to replace month and day names with numeric representations.",
  "sources": "User-provided datetime strings, timestamp inputs, and expression strings split into parts.",
  "sinks": "Parsing functions using dateutil.parser.parse, datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp, and replacing tzinfo. No untrusted data flows into system commands or network.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> parsing functions -> datetime objects with tzinfo. Expression splitting -> regex substitution -> reconstructed strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code performs standard date parsing and string replacements. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries for date and time parsing, with regex for replacing month and day names with numerical indices. get_tz function retrieves timezone info based on string input, which is safe as it relies on pytz library. No dangerous code injection or malicious network activity is present. The functions handle untrusted input by parsing strings or timestamps without executing external commands or accessing sensitive data. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of date and time parsing utilities with safe string replacements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for date-time processing tasks, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
