  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for date/time parsing, timezone handling, and string replacements for month and weekday names.",
  "sources": "Input strings for date/time parsing, timezone names, and expressions with month/day names.",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed or manipulated within functions; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. Regex replacements are safe and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard date/time utilities, including timezone retrieval, timestamp conversion, string parsing, and name replacements. It relies on well-maintained libraries (datetime, re, dateutil, pytz). No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The regex replacements are simple and do not pose security risks. The functions handle untrusted input cautiously, with no external calls or data exfiltration. Minor concern about regex replacing names in untrusted input is mitigated by the benign nature of operations. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module for date/time handling with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of regex manipulations without actual vulnerabilities. All reports' assessments are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
