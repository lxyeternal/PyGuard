  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a utility for categorizing and sorting Python import statements.\n- It relies on external modules (`aspy.refactor_imports`) for classification and import object handling.\n- No external data is processed, no network activity, no code execution, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- The logic is straightforward: classify, sort within categories, and output grouped imports.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly states the code sorts and categorizes imports without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, SecurityRisk: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The high confidence score is justified. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent and accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, focusing on the utility nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are reasonable; slightly less than perfect confidence but still aligned with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign, utility purpose.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Also states the code is a benign import sorter.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All scores align with the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All are zero or near-zero, indicating no security concern.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  Correctly zero; no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their assessments on observable code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final System-Level Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (benign utility)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk detected)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard import sorting utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No further action required.",
