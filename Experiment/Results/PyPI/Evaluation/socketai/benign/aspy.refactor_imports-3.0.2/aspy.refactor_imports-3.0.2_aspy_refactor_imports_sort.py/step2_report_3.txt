  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a utility for sorting and categorizing Python import statements.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or code execution are described.\n- The code relies on standard and third-party modules (`aspy.refactor_imports`) for classification and object handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be code organization, formatting, or linting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and logically consistent. It classifies imports, handles special cases (FUTURE as BUILTIN), sorts within categories, and returns a tuple of grouped imports.\n- **Security concerns:** No evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious logic.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None detected; scores are 0 in all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; scores are 0.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, consistent with benign utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scoring:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or 0.5. Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate; 0.5 might be used if there's uncertainty, but no evidence supports that here.\n- **Consistency:** Scores align with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the external `aspy.refactor_imports` package functions correctly and securely. If that package were malicious, the risk could be higher, but based on the provided code, the utility itself is safe.\n- No code injection or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The classification logic is straightforward and based on module names, with a special case for FUTURE imports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I concur that:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard utility for organizing Python imports.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, well-structured, and performs a common task without security implications. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware: 0.0**  \n**Obfuscated: 0.0**  \n**Risk: 0.0**",
