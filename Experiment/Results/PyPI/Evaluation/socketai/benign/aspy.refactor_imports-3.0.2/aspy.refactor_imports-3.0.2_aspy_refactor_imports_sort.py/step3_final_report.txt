  "purpose": "Utility function to classify and sort Python import statements into organized groups.",
  "sources": "Import statement modules, particularly 'import_statement.module' attribute.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Classification of each import -> grouping in 'imports_partitioned' -> sorting within each group -> output as grouped tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward classification and sorting logic, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code classifies import objects based on their module names, reclassifies FUTURE imports as BUILTIN, then sorts each category based on a key. It uses external classification functions, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The logic is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No external data flows or network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for organizing import statements, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior detected. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
