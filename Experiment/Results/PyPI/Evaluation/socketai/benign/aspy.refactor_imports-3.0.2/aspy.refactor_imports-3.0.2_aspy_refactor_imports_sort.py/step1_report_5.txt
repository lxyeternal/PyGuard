{
  "purpose": "The code sorts Python import statements into categorized groups for better organization and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input is a sequence of import objects (`AbstractImportObj` instances) passed to the `sort()` function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code processes data internally without executing untrusted input or writing external data.",
  "flows": "Input import objects are classified, then sorted within categories based on their type and sort key, resulting in ordered grouped output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code performs standard import classification and sorting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and functions for import classification and object handling. It defines a dictionary for class-to-index mapping. The `sort()` function groups import objects based on their type, with a special case for FUTURE imports that are reclassified as BUILTIN. It then sorts each group internally by a key derived from the object. Finally, it outputs the grouped import objects as a tuple of tuples, ordered according to predefined import types. The logic is straightforward, with no external data execution or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to serve a utility purpose for code style enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs import statement classification and sorting to organize code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard utility function with no malicious intent.",
