{
  "purpose": "The code sorts and categorizes Python import statements into groups for formatting or analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statement objects passed to the 'sort' function, and classification functions that analyze import modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or output untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or system operations.",
  "flows": "Input import objects are classified and sorted within the function; no external data flows or sensitive data handling are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The import classification and sorting are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a sorting function for import objects, utilizing classification and sorting mechanisms. It uses standard libraries and functions from an external 'aspy' package. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and performs only standard import organization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It is a straightforward implementation of import sorting and categorization, with no suspicious operations.",
