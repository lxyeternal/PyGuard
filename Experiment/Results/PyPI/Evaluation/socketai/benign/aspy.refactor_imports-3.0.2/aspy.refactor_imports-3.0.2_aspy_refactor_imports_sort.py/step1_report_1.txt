{
  "purpose": "The code sorts and categorizes Python import statements into different groups based on import type and other criteria.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statement objects passed as the 'imports' parameter and the modules within these objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code mainly processes import objects for sorting, with no untrusted data effect or external communication.",
  "flows": "Imports are classified and sorted internally; no external data flows or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected. The use of type classification and sorting is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a sorting function that categorizes import statements into groups like FUTURE, BUILTIN, etc., using classify_import. It then sorts each group based on a custom key. No external data manipulation, network communication, or code execution occurs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The logic is clear and intended for organizing code imports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility for organizing Python imports with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs classification and sorting based on import types, which is standard practice. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
