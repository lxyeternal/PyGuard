{
  "purpose": "The code sorts import statements into groups for formatting or organization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements via the 'imports' parameter, which is a sequence of AbstractImportObj objects.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or output untrusted data; it only sorts import objects internally.",
  "flows": "Imports are classified using 'classify_import', then sorted within their groups. No data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code relies on standard library and external 'aspy' package functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and external modules, defines a mapping, and sorts import statements based on classification and sort keys. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The sorting logic is straightforward and intended for code formatting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import sorter with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is likely part of a code formatting or linting tool.",
