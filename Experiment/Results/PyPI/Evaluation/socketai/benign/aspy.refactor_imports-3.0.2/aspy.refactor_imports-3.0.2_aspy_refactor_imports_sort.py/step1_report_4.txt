{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to sort Python import statements into categorized groups for code formatting or organization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements provided as a sequence of AbstractImportObj objects, specifically inspecting the module attribute of import_statement within each object.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or executes untrusted code. No external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source data (import objects) are classified into types, then sorted within each type, and finally returned as sorted groups. No data flows to external systems or causes side effects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard library and third-party modules in a straightforward manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classification functions and defines a sorting function for import statements. It classifies imports based on module names, with special handling for FUTURE imports. The sorting uses predefined keys and sorts within categories. All operations are standard data manipulations without executing or transforming data in dangerous ways. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The overall code appears to serve a utility purpose for code formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for sorting import statements into organized groups. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It safely processes provided data without side effects or external interactions.",
