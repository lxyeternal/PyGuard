{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function from setuptools, which reads package metadata and configuration (although none is provided here).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, as the code simply calls 'setup()' with no parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; the setup process is standard and static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The import from __future__ is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script imports '__future__.annotations' for forward reference support, then calls 'setup()' with default parameters. There are no additional parameters, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. This appears to be a minimal, benign setup script typical in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It performs a straightforward package setup with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
