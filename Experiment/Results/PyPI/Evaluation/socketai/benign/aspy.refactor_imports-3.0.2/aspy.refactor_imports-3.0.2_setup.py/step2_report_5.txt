  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a minimal setup script importing `__future__.annotations` and calling `setup()` with default parameters.\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious code constructs.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all assessments correctly identify the code as non-malicious, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic behaviors that could introduce risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious intent.\n   - No signs of backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as standard and benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python setup script with no security issues.\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes are necessary.",
