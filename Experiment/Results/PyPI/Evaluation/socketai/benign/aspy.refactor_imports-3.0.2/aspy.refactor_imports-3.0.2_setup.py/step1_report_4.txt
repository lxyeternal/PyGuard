{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __future__ import statement, which influences the language features, and the setup() function call that initiates package setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted input or data flows leading to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink, as the code merely imports a future feature and calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a __future__ feature to ensure compatibility or language feature support, then calls setup() from setuptools to define package configuration. There are no user inputs, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The code does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent. It appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely to facilitate package installation.",
