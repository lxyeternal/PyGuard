{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package installation configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call from setuptools, which may read package metadata and files during installation.",
  "sinks": "Potential file reads or writes during setup, but none are explicitly shown in the code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are present; setup() executes with default parameters, no data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code segments observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'annotations' feature from __future__, which is standard for forward compatibility. It then imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls setup() with default parameters. The code is minimal and appears to be a typical setup script without any suspicious or malicious elements. There are no hidden code, obfuscated segments, or external data interactions that indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
