{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, a common package management tool.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code imports __future__ annotations and calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as no input or data processing occurs beyond the setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no suspicious or unusual patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations from __future__ for compatibility and calls setup() from setuptools with default arguments. This is typical for a setup script for a Python package. No data input, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The script does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or other potentially dangerous actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks.",
