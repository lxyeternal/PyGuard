  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script importing annotations and calling setup() with default parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes setup() without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, minimal setup script that imports __future__.annotations and calls setup() with default parameters. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or manipulate files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe package configuration.",
