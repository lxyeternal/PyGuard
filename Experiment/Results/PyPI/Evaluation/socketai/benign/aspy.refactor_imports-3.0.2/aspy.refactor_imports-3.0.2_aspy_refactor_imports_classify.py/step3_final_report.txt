{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to classify Python modules into categories such as built-in, third-party, application, or future, based on environment variables, filesystem paths, and import specifications.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PYTHONPATH', sys.builtin_module_names, importlib.util.find_spec, filesystem paths, and module specifications.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem path checks, importlib spec analysis, environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "Source data (environment variables, import specs) influence path and spec analysis, leading to classification decisions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard path and environment checks are used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module classification based on environment variables, importlib specifications, and filesystem paths. It distinguishes between built-in, third-party, and application modules without executing or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The reliance on environment variables and filesystem paths is typical for such utilities, and no signs of sabotage or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for classifying Python modules. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose.",
