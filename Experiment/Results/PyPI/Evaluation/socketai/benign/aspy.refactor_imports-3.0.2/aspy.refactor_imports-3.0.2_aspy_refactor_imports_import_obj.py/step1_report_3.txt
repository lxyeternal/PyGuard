  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for parsing, handling, and sorting Python import statements and AST objects.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from string representations of Python import statements, parsed into AST objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not write untrusted data, execute commands, or access sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into AST objects; these are processed into import objects, with no data leaving or being sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward AST parsing. No obfuscated code or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code safely parses import statements into ASTs, converts them into structured objects, and provides sorting and formatting functions. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic is clear, well-structured, and relies solely on standard Python features and modules. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling Python import statements with no malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within the scope of parsing and formatting code structures without any suspicious activities.",
