{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for parsing, sorting, and representing Python import statements, supporting both 'import' and 'from ... import' formats.",
  "sources": "Input strings parsed via _from_str; reading from provided import statement strings.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform data leakage or insecure operations; no untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into AST objects, then converted into internal import representations, with sorting and formatting operations. No untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code is purely utility functions for AST parsing and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for parsing Python import statements from strings into AST objects, then wraps them into classes with sorting and formatting methods. It uses safe standard library modules and performs no network or file operations. No suspicious behaviors, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are detected. The code is structured and standard, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for handling import statements and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and suitable for use in larger projects.",
