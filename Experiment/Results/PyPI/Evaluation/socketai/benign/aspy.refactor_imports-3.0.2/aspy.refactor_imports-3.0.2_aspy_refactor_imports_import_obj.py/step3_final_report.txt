  "purpose": "Utility module for parsing, representing, sorting, and splitting Python import statements using AST.",
  "sources": "AST parsing of input strings, reading import statement text.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external effects.",
  "flows": "Parsing input strings into AST nodes, converting AST nodes back to formatted import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The assertion in `_from_str` (`assert isinstance(obj, tp)`) is a potential bug; it compares an AST node to a type, which may cause runtime errors. However, the code as written is correct because `ast.parse(s).body[0]` returns an AST node, and `tp` is a class like `ast.Import`. The assertion should be `isinstance(obj, tp)` which is correct in this context. No malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for handling import statements via AST parsing. It provides comparison, sorting, splitting, and formatting functions. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The only minor concern is the assertion in `_from_str`, which appears to be a bug but is not malicious. The code uses standard libraries and patterns, with no obfuscation or external effects. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature. The slight security risk score (0.1) in report 5 reflects the potential for runtime errors due to the assertion, but it does not imply security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for parsing and formatting import statements, with no malware or obfuscation. The only issue is a minor implementation bug in `_from_str` that could cause runtime errors but does not pose security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
