{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for parsing, representing, and sorting Python import statements, both 'import' and 'from ... import' types, using abstract syntax trees (AST).",
  "sources": "The code reads input from strings representing import statements, parsed into AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data directly leads to data leaks, system commands, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into AST objects, which are then used to create import representations and sorted, but there are no flows leading to execution or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or malicious constructs are present. The code is primarily utility functions for AST parsing and sorting. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries and common practices for AST parsing and import handling. It includes functions for converting AST import nodes into structured objects, sorting, and formatting. No functions or code segments perform network operations, file manipulation, or system commands. The code appears to be a utility module for import statement processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for managing import statements via AST parsing. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious activities identified.",
