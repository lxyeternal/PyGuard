{
  "purpose": "Defines a namespace package by extending the __path__ attribute.",
  "sources": "The code reads the built-in 'pkgutil' module and the __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the __path__ attribute for namespace package functionality.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' to support namespace package features. It references __path__ and __name__, which are standard in package initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The code is consistent with standard namespace package definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard implementation of a namespace package using 'pkgutil'. It does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
