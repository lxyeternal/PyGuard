{
  "purpose": "Defines a namespace package by extending the package path, enabling multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'pkgutil' and the use of '__import__' to extend '__path__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil', then extends '__path__' using 'extend_path' to modify the namespace package's search path.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses '__import__' and '__path__' in a standard way for namespace packages; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard for creating a namespace package in Python. It leverages the '__future__' import for annotations, which is a common practice for forward compatibility. The extension of '__path__' via 'pkgutil.extend_path' is a typical pattern for namespace packages, allowing multiple distributions to share a common namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code's simplicity and standard pattern suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard implementation of a namespace package in Python with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
