  "purpose": "Define a namespace package that extends the package path for modular imports.",
  "sources": "The import of 'pkgutil' and the assignment to __path__",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or harm",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies __path__, but there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the __path__ attribute to support namespace packages. There are no user inputs, no external data sources, or dynamic code execution. The code follows standard Python namespace package pattern without any obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace package setup without malicious intent or security risks.",
