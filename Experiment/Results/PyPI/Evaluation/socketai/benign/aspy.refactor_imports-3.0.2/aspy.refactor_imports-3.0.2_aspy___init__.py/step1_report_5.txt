  "purpose": "Defines a namespace package by extending the package's __path__ using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and __import__('pkgutil').extend_path",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sink that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Import and extension of __path__, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, but the use of extend_path in a namespace package is typical; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a namespace package by extending __path__ with pkgutil.extend_path, which is a standard practice for namespace packages in Python. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, or other suspicious activities. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a structural purpose in package organization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a namespace package setup with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
