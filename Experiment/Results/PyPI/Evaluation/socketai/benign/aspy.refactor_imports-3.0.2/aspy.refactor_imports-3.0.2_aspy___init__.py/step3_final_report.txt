{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a namespace package by extending __path__ using pkgutil's extend_path function.",
  "sources": "The code reads package variables __path__ and __name__, and imports 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__ to defining the namespace package structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard implementation of a Python namespace package. It imports 'pkgutil', uses __import__ to extend __path__, and relies on package variables. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The pattern is well-known and safe. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
