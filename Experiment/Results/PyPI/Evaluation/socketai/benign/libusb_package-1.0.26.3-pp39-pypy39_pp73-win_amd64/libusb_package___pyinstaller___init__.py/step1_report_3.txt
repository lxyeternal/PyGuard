  "purpose": "The code appears to define a function that returns the directory path of the current file.",
  "sources": "Reading the special variable __file__ to determine the script's file path",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output to external sources or untrusted destinations are present",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is used to determine directory, but this data is not passed or sent elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a function get_hook_dirs() that returns the directory containing the script. It uses __file__ to locate the script's path and os.path.dirname to extract the directory. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secret data handling. The code is simple and adheres to typical patterns for obtaining the current script directory.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign operation to retrieve its directory path. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are present.",
