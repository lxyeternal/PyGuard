{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a function that returns the directory of the current file, likely used for locating resources or configuration files relative to the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) flows directly into os.path.dirname to produce the directory path.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a function get_hook_dirs() which returns the directory of the current script. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data sources. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute dynamic code. It serves a simple purpose and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and safe. It only provides a utility function to retrieve the current script's directory without any malicious intent or security risks.",
