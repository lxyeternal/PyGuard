  "purpose": "Provides a function to return the directory path of the current file.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path via __file__ and os.path.dirname.",
  "sinks": "None present that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Input (__file__) flows to os.path.dirname, returning the directory path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the os module and defines a function that returns the directory of the current script. It uses __file__ to get the filename and then derives its directory. This is standard practice for locating resources relative to the script. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is involved. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and straightforward with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
