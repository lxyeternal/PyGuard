  "purpose": "Retrieve the directory of the current script file",
  "sources": "os module, __file__ variable",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data output or external communication",
  "flows": "Input (os, __file__) -> return value from get_hook_dirs()",
  "anomalies": "None; code is simple and straightforward, no obfuscation or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a function get_hook_dirs() that returns a list containing the directory path of the current script file using os.path.dirname(__file__). No external data input is read during execution, and the function merely provides the script's directory. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a utility function intended for local path resolution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply returns the directory path of the current script file.",
