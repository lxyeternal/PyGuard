  "purpose": "Retrieve the directory path of the current script file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the script's location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or output data.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is used directly in os.path.dirname to produce the output list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines get_hook_dirs() which returns a list containing os.path.dirname(__file__). This is a common pattern for locating resources relative to the script. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The code is benign and performs a simple, well-understood operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function that retrieves the script's directory. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
