{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, without any functional code beyond version declaration.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string and tuple assignment for version variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply assigns static version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version variables for a Python package, with a conditional type-checking block. The version is hardcoded as a string and a tuple, both static values. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. No obfuscation, no malicious logic, and no potential security issues are present. The code is straightforward and standard for versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define version information. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
