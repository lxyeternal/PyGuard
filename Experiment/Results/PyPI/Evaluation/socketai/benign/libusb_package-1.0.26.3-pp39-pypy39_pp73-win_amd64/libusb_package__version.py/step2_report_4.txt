  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration with static assignments.\n   - No issues such as malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic data processing are present.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate generated by setuptools-scm, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify higher scores because there are no indicators of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The static, non-obfuscated code with no external data input warrants a zero risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code as benign boilerplate.\n   - The assessments are based on observable static code analysis.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, autogenerated version declaration module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the issues as benign. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\nThis aligns with the observed code characteristics and the detailed analysis provided.",
