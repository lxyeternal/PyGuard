  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, imports within TYPE_CHECKING block",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard version declaration boilerplate",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version metadata for a package. It uses conditional import statements for type hints, which is standard practice. The version strings and tuples are hardcoded as static assignments with no dynamic or external data involved. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be boilerplate generated by setuptools-scm for version management, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard version declaration boilerplate with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
