  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration module, generated by setuptools-scm.\n   - The code only assigns static version strings and tuples to variables, with no dynamic input, external data, or processing.\n   - The conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` block is standard for type hints and does not execute at runtime.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious logic is present.\n\n2. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Given the static nature and standard pattern, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n   - The code does not interact with external sources, files, network, or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n\n4. **Any Anomalies or Flaws**:\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or code flaws are observed.\n   - The reports are thorough and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a boilerplate version declaration, typical in package setup files.\n   - It poses no security risk, malware threat, or obfuscation concern.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional notes**:\n- Since the code is static and standard, there's no reason to assign any higher scores.\n- The confidence level is appropriately high (1) across reports.\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
