  "purpose": "Static declaration of package version information, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external sources involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments are independent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard type-checking conditional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version metadata module with no dynamic input, external data, or malicious logic. The conditional TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hints and does not execute at runtime. All variables are assigned fixed values, and there are no signs of obfuscation, code injection, or network activity. The code's purpose is purely to provide version information, common in package setup files. The scores from all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with this benign, static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate version declaration snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
