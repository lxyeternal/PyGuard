  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, primarily for internal use and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings assigned to variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external input or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Assignment of hardcoded version strings to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior detected. The code contains only straightforward version assignments and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version metadata module with static assignments. It includes conditional type checking logic but does not execute or load external data. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The structure and content are consistent with standard package version definition files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard versioning module with no signs of malware or security risks. It simply sets package version variables for internal or external use.",
