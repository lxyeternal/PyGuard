  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, static declaration of version information for a Python package.\n   - It assigns a version string `'1.0.26.3'` to `__version__` and `version`, and a tuple `(1, 0, 26, 3)` to `__version_tuple__` and `version_tuple`.\n   - The conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` block is standard for type hinting and does not execute at runtime.\n   - There are no external inputs, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no data processing or network activity.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - The code contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n   - All variables are statically assigned, and there are no suspicious patterns or external data flows.\n   - The purpose is purely to define version metadata, a common pattern in package setup files.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is boilerplate generated by `setuptools-scm`.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content and analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Errors in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no flaws or logical errors are evident.\n   - They correctly interpret the static nature of the code and its benign purpose.\n\n5. **Score Justification:**\n   - Since all reports assign a malware score of 0 and no suspicious activity is detected, this aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The risk score is appropriately 0, as there's no security concern.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly identified as absent.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical version declaration snippet, with no malicious or security implications.\n   - The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code should be considered safe, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
