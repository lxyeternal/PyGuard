{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, providing version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or security issues; all are simple variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Version string assignments flow from hardcoded string to module variables; no external data input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials other than version strings, no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version-related variables for a package, with clear static assignment. No input/output or data processing occurs. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The version string is static and appears as a normal package metadata configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration used in packaging; it contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and poses no security risk.",
