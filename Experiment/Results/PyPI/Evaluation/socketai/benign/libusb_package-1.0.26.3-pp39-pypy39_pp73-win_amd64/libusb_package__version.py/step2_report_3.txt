  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration module, generated by `setuptools-scm`.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples to variables, with no dynamic input, external data, or complex logic.\n   - The conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` block is standard for type hints and does not execute at runtime unless type checking is performed.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data processing.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks:**\n   - The code contains only static assignments related to package versioning.\n   - No input/output, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated logic.\n   - The purpose is purely metadata management for packaging, which is a common and benign practice.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, standard boilerplate, with no malicious intent.\n   - They assign a confidence level of 1, with malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores all at 0.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent: no suspicious behavior, no vulnerabilities, no malware.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, aligning with the code's nature.\n   - The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, generated version metadata file with no security issues.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual content.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the security assessment is correct.",
