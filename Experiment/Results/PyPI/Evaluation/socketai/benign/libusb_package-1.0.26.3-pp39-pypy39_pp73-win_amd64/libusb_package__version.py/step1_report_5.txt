  "purpose": "Define versioning information for a Python package using setuptools-scm, without any additional logic or operations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static version information to variables, with no external data input or processing. The use of conditional TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints and does not introduce any security issues. There are no obfuscated elements, network operations, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard autogenerated version file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets static version variables for the package.",
