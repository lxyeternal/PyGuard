{
  "purpose": "Collects dynamic library dependencies for packaging, specifically the 'libusb' shared library, and copies them to the package directory.",
  "sources": "The function call to 'collect_dynamic_libs' with the argument 'libusb_package'.",
  "sinks": "The 'collect_dynamic_libs' function potentially writes shared library files to the destination directory.",
  "flows": "Input: 'libusb_package' argument to 'collect_dynamic_libs' -> Output: copying shared libraries to current directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs a standard dependency collection for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility from PyInstaller to gather dynamic libraries related to 'libusb'. It then copies these libraries into the current directory, likely for inclusion in a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. This is a typical packaging utility script with no security risks or malware indications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency collection step for packaging Python applications with PyInstaller. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
