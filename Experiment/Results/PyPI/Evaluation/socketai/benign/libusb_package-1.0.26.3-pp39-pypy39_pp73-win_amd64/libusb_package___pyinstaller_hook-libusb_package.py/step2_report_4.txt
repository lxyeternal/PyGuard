  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same core code: a straightforward call to `collect_dynamic_libs('libusb_package', destdir='.')`.\n- The purpose across reports is to include 'libusb' shared libraries into a packaged application.\n- No reports indicate any suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalous behavior.\n- The code is a standard utility in PyInstaller-based packaging workflows.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's behavior:\n- The code simply imports `collect_dynamic_libs` from PyInstaller and calls it with specific arguments.\n- This is a legitimate, well-documented utility for including dependencies in frozen applications.\n- There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, network activity, or other malicious actions.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code is minimal and correct for its intended purpose.\n- No indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** 0. Given the benign behavior, this is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely a dependency collection utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior, scores of 0 are justified.\n- The function is a standard part of packaging workflows, not an attack vector.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No issues or assumptions are made that could be challenged.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- If I were to assign scores based solely on the code snippet and reports, I agree with the current scores.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe for inclusion in packaging workflows.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate utility for dependency collection.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.",
