  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its intent, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code imports `collect_dynamic_libs` from PyInstaller's hooks and calls it to gather shared libraries related to `'libusb_package'`, copying them into the current directory. This is a common step in packaging Python applications with PyInstaller, ensuring dependencies are bundled.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- The code is straightforward, using a legitimate PyInstaller utility.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data handling.\n- No network communication, data exfiltration, or secret management.\n- The purpose is to include shared libraries (`libusb`) into a package.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and straightforward.\n- They correctly identify that the function collects shared libraries for packaging.\n- No report claims any suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No logical flaws or mistakes in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n- The `malware` score is 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- The `securityRisk` is 0, reflecting no security concern.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, indicating code clarity.\n- The code is a standard dependency collection step, not risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores is needed.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No suspicious behaviors, no network activity, no secret handling.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities**\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n- All reports are consistent in their benign assessment.\n- The scores match the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimation**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The code is a typical dependency inclusion step in packaging workflows.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, benign utility for including shared libraries (`libusb`) into a packaged application. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature and standard use of the code.",
