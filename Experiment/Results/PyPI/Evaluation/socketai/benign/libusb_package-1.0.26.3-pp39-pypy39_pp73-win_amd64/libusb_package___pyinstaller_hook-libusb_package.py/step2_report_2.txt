  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: a call to `collect_dynamic_libs('libusb_package', destdir='.')`.\n- The purpose across reports is to gather and include the 'libusb' shared library for packaging with PyInstaller.\n- No reports indicate any suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.\n- The code is straightforward, using a standard PyInstaller utility to include dependencies.\n\n**Confirming code presence and behavior:**\n- The code snippet provided matches the described purpose: it imports `collect_dynamic_libs` and calls it with specific arguments.\n- The function is used as intended in packaging workflows, with no signs of misuse.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code is minimal and correct for its purpose.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Risk score justification:**\n- Since the code is purely a dependency collection utility with no malicious activity, a `risk` score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The `malware` score is correctly 0, as there's no malware present.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, matching the straightforward code.\n\n**Potential issues with assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on straightforward code analysis without assumptions of hidden malicious intent.\n- No evidence suggests that the code could be malicious or dangerous.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard packaging utility.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, benign dependency collection step for packaging with PyInstaller. The scores are accurate, and there are no security concerns based on the provided information.",
