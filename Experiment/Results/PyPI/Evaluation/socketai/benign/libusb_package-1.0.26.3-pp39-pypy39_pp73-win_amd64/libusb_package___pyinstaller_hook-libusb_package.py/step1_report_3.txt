{
  "purpose": "To collect and include dynamic libraries ('libusb') into the package distribution for use at runtime.",
  "sources": "The function 'collect_dynamic_libs' retrieves shared libraries from the specified package 'libusb_package'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The collected libraries are copied into the package directory, which could be used by other parts of the package at runtime but no direct data flow or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses a standard utility for including dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'collect_dynamic_libs' from PyInstaller's hooks to gather shared libraries related to 'libusb'. It then copies these libraries into the current directory for packaging. There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated behavior. The code performs a legitimate function typical in packaging processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency collection step for packaging with PyInstaller. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
