  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the underlying code:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code imports `collect_dynamic_libs` from PyInstaller's hooks and calls it with `'libusb_package'`, copying the resulting shared libraries into the current directory.\n   - This is a standard procedure for including dependencies in a frozen Python application.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident.\n   - The purpose aligns with typical packaging practices.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n   - The code is minimal and correctly uses the intended utility.\n\n4. **Score Evaluations:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `risk` scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Justification for Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, standard dependency collection, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - No suspicious activity or malicious intent is detected.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are consistent with standard packaging behavior.\n\n8. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a typical dependency collection script used in packaging with PyInstaller.\n- No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Note:**\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
