{
  "purpose": "Collects dynamic library dependencies for packaging, specifically 'libusb', using PyInstaller's hook system.",
  "sources": "The function collect_dynamic_libs reads the 'libusb_package' package or module to gather shared libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the collected binaries to the current directory ('.') as part of the packaging process.",
  "flows": "collect_dynamic_libs reads from 'libusb_package', and the binaries are saved in the current directory, with no data flowing from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a utility from PyInstaller to gather dynamic libraries associated with 'libusb'. It then saves these libraries to the current directory for inclusion in a package. The code is minimal, standard for packaging, and does not perform any network communication, data processing, or other potentially malicious actions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate packaging utility script with no indications of malicious behavior. It simply gathers shared libraries for packaging purposes using a standard PyInstaller hook.",
