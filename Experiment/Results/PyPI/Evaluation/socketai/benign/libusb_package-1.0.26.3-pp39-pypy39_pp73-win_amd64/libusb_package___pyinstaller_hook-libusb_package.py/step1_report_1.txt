{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to collect and include dynamic library files (specifically 'libusb') into a package distribution, likely to ensure dependencies are bundled for packaging with PyInstaller.",
  "sources": "collect_dynamic_libs('libusb_package', destdir='.')",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data output or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A – the function collects shared libraries and copies them into the specified destination directory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; the code uses a legitimate PyInstaller utility to include shared libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'collect_dynamic_libs' from PyInstaller's hooks, then calls it to gather shared libraries related to 'libusb' and copies them into the current directory. It is a standard practice for including dependencies in frozen packages. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. It is a straightforward dependency collection step.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and benign utility for including a shared library in a packaged application. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
