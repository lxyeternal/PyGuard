{
  "purpose": "To collect and include the 'libusb' shared library dependencies into the package directory during the PyInstaller build process.",
  "sources": "The call to 'collect_dynamic_libs' with argument 'libusb_package' and 'destdir=\".\"' which reads the shared library files from the environment or system libraries.",
  "sinks": "The copying of shared library files into the current directory; no untrusted data or external network activity involved.",
  "flows": "The function 'collect_dynamic_libs' retrieves the shared libraries ('libusb') and copies them into the package directory, with no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, uses standard PyInstaller utility, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a legitimate PyInstaller utility to gather shared libraries related to 'libusb' and copies them into the current directory for packaging. It performs a standard dependency inclusion step without any malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal, clear, and correctly used for its purpose. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency collection utility used in packaging workflows. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
