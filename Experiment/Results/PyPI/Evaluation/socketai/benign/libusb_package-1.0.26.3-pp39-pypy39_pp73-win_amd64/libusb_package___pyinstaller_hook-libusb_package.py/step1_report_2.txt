{
  "purpose": "To collect and copy dynamic libraries (specifically 'libusb') for inclusion in a packaged Python application.",
  "sources": "The function call to 'collect_dynamic_libs' which retrieves shared libraries related to 'libusb'.",
  "sinks": "The destination directory 'destdir' where the shared libraries are copied; no direct sink of untrusted input is apparent.",
  "flows": "The code gathers shared libraries associated with 'libusb' and copies them to the current directory, facilitating packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of 'collect_dynamic_libs' is a standard practice for including dependencies in packaged applications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific utility from PyInstaller to collect shared libraries related to 'libusb' and copies them to the current directory. This is a typical process for preparing a standalone executable with necessary dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is simple and straightforward, aimed at dependency management for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate function related to packaging dependencies and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard utility use for including external libraries in a Python package.",
