  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The original code is a straightforward use of PyInstaller's `collect_dynamic_libs` utility to gather shared libraries related to 'libusb' and copy them into the current directory for packaging. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is standard for dependency inclusion during packaging.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code performs dependency collection using a legitimate PyInstaller utility, with no anomalies or malicious intent. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign a malware score of 0, and the code is benign, there's no justification for a higher risk score. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions such as executing arbitrary code, exfiltrating data, or connecting to external servers. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All claims are based on the code's straightforward behavior. There are no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard dependency collection utility with no security risks or malicious behavior.**",
