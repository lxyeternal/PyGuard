  "purpose": "This code defines the public API for the pytest_httpserver package, exporting various classes and constants related to HTTP server handling for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; all data appears to come from imported modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no functions or operations that handle untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code only declares and exports constants and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that defines an API interface by listing exported names and importing components from internal modules. It contains no logic, data processing, or external input handling. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, and the structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer that exports various components of the pytest_httpserver package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code appears safe and intentional.",
