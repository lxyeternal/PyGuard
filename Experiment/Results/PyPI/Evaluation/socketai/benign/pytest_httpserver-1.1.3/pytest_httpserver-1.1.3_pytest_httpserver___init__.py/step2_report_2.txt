  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent with the code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a typical `__init__.py` module for a Python package.\n- It declares an `__all__` list of symbols to export.\n- It imports classes and constants from internal modules (`.blocking_httpserver` and `.httpserver`).\n- There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The code appears to serve as an API surface for the `pytest_httpserver` package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** The reports consistently describe the code as a standard API surface, with no anomalies or security issues.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, and `securityRisk` as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Are the justifications for risk scores > 0.5 valid?**  \n  Not applicable here, as all scores are 0.\n\n- **Are the malware scores consistent with the report?**  \n  Yes. The code contains no malicious behavior, so malware score 0 is correct.\n\n- **Are the claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as a benign API surface with no vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent with the report?**  \n  Yes, all reports are consistent in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional comments:\nGiven the code snippet and the reports, there is no indication of any security concern. The code is a typical package initializer exposing internal classes and constants, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. I agree with the assessments provided.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
