{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an API interface for the pytest_httpserver package, exporting various classes and constants for use in testing HTTP servers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own imported components and the package's exported list.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "The code only imports and exports components; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily defining the public API for the package by listing exported symbols and importing components from submodules. It does not process or execute untrusted data, nor does it contain dynamic code execution, external network calls, or credential management. Its structure is typical for a package's __init__.py file, which facilitates namespace management. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script that exports components for use by clients. It shows no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
