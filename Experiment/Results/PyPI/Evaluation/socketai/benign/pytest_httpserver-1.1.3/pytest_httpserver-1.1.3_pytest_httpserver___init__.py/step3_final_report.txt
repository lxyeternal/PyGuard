{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the __init__.py module for the pytest_httpserver package, defining the public API by exporting specific classes and constants imported from internal modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes and constants from internal modules (.blocking_httpserver and .httpserver).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up the API surface without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer (__init__.py) that declares an __all__ list and imports classes/constants from internal modules. It contains no functions, dynamic code, or external interactions. The structure is typical for exposing an API surface. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as safe and typical for a Python package's API setup.",
