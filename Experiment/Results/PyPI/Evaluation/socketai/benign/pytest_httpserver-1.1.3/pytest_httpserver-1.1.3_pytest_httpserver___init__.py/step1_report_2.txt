{
  "purpose": "This package provides the main API interface for the pytest_httpserver library, exporting various classes and constants related to HTTP server functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.blocking_httpserver and .httpserver)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious payloads; no functions executing system commands, network connections, or handling untrusted input directly",
  "flows": "The code merely imports and exposes components; there are no data flows, input handling, or processing logic present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring, an __all__ declaration, and import statements from internal modules. It functions as an API surface, exposing classes and constants. No executable logic, input processing, or external communications are present. The structure is standard for Python package modules and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies in this code fragment. It appears to be a legitimate, straightforward API exposure module for a testing library.",
