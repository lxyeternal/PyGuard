{
  "purpose": "This package provides the main API interface for the pytest_httpserver package, importing various classes and constants related to HTTP server handling for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static attribute definitions and imports modules from relative files (.blocking_httpserver and .httpserver).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The code defines exported symbols and imports components from other modules; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares an API surface via __all__ and imports classes and constants from internal modules. There are no functions, no data input handling, nor any system calls or network interactions. The import statements reference local modules, which are not included here, but nothing suspicious appears from the current fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__ module that sets up exports for a Python testing library. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security issues in this fragment.",
