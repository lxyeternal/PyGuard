  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` module for a Python package.\n- It declares an `__all__` list of exported symbols.\n- It imports classes and constants from internal modules (`.blocking_httpserver` and `.httpserver`).\n- There are no functions, data processing, external system calls, or untrusted data handling.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for a package API surface setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard package initialization module.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and typical for a Python package's `__init__.py`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The reports identify no issues, anomalies, or security concerns, which aligns with the code content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  **None.** The code is straightforward and correctly structured for its purpose.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk)?**  \n  All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified. No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified. The code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified. The code is a standard API surface setup with no security implications.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, the code is a typical, benign package initialization file. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese match the reports' assessments and are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, standard, and free of security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
