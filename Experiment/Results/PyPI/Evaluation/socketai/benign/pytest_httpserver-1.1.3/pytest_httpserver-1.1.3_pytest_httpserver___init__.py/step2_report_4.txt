  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward, standard __init__ module for a Python package, mainly exporting symbols and importing internal modules.\n- No untrusted data, external system interactions, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0) and report no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n\n- The code is a typical package __init__ that declares `__all__` and imports classes/constants from internal modules.\n- There are no functions, no data processing, no network calls, and no handling of untrusted input.\n- The imports are from local modules (.blocking_httpserver and .httpserver), which are not provided but are presumably part of the package.\n\n**Logical and security analysis:**\n\n- The code's structure is standard for exposing an API surface.\n- No signs of malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No external system calls or credential handling.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward import/export code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which seems appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusion that this code is benign and standard is justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- Given the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports provided.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package __init__ module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
