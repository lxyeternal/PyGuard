{
  "purpose": "This code provides the main API interface for the pytest_httpserver package, defining exports and importing components from internal modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module definitions, imported class and constant names, and the package's internal module files (.blocking_httpserver and .httpserver).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; it does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code primarily exports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are evident. The code consists solely of straightforward import/export statements and module documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that defines the public API of a package by listing exported symbols and importing internal components. It contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns. The initial comment indicates purpose but reveals no malicious intent. All operations are typical of package interface definition files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign API interface file for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
