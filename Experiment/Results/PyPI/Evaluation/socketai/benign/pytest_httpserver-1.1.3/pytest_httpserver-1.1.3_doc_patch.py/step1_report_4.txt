{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to configure the pytest_httpserver package for proper referencing of classes within TYPE_CHECKING blocks, facilitating static type checking and reference resolution.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules and classes: SSLContext from ssl, Request and Response from werkzeug, and internal modules pytest_httpserver.blocking_httpserver and pytest_httpserver.httpserver.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns imported classes and objects to attributes within pytest_httpserver modules, potentially affecting the internal behavior of these modules.",
  "flows": "Imported classes are assigned to internal module attributes, linking external class definitions to the pytest_httpserver modules' internal references.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code simply reassigns class references for type checking purposes. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes for type annotations and assigns these classes to internal module attributes of pytest_httpserver. This likely ensures that during type checking, references resolve correctly, especially within TYPE_CHECKING blocks. The assignments do not execute any runtime logic beyond simple attribute assignment. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The code does not perform any network operations or handle untrusted input. It appears to be a straightforward setup for static type support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet aimed at supporting static type checking for the pytest_httpserver package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
