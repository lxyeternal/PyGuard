{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes from ssl and werkzeug modules and assigns them to attributes within the pytest_httpserver submodules, primarily for facilitating testing, static type checking, or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from ssl and werkzeug modules; attribute assignments to pytest_httpserver.submodules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects present",
  "flows": "Imported classes are assigned directly to module attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusual attribute reassignment of imported classes, but common in test/mocking setups; no malicious or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and attribute assignments without executing any malicious actions. The reassignment is typical in testing or type hinting contexts. No network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection observed. The code is clear, simple, and serves as a setup or configuration snippet for testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for test setup, documentation, or static type checking support. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
