{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up references for the pytest_httpserver module to use SSLContext, Request, and Response classes from other modules, likely for testing or compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules: ssl, werkzeug, pytest_httpserver.blocking_httpserver, and pytest_httpserver.httpserver.",
  "targets": "The code assigns imported classes (SSLContext, Request, Response) to attributes within pytest_httpserver modules, which could influence the behavior of these modules during tests.",
  "flows": "Imported classes are assigned to module attributes, allowing subsequent code within pytest_httpserver to utilize these references, potentially affecting request handling or SSL context configuration during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code merely reassigns existing classes to module attributes for testing purposes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The script's purpose appears to be to facilitate testing by replacing certain classes within pytest_httpserver modules with specific implementations. It imports necessary classes and assigns them directly to module attributes, likely to control or mock behavior during tests. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious data handling. The code's scope is limited to configuration for testing and does not involve network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup snippet for testing environments, replacing classes for controlled testing conditions. It does not exhibit any malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
