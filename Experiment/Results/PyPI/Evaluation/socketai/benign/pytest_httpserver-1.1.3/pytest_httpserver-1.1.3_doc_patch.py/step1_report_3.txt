{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up references for classes used in a testing environment, specifically for the pytest_httpserver library to support SSL contexts and HTTP request/response objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads the SSLContext from the ssl module, and the Request and Response classes from the werkzeug library. It also interacts with the pytest_httpserver.httpserver and pytest_httpserver.blocking_httpserver modules.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns imported classes and objects to attributes within pytest_httpserver modules, which could influence the behavior of tests that rely on these references.",
  "flows": "The imported SSLContext, Request, and Response are assigned to attributes within pytest_httpserver modules, potentially affecting how these modules operate during testing. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward import and reassignment operations with no evidence of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious code injection. It is purely for testing setup purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes and reassigns them within the pytest_httpserver modules, likely to facilitate testing with custom SSL contexts and request/response handling. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. The purpose appears to be environment setup for tests rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely for testing configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or supply chain sabotage. It simply sets references for testing purposes.",
