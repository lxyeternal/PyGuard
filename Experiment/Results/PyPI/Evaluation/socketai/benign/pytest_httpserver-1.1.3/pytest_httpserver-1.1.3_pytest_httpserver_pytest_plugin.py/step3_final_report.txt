{
  "purpose": "Provides pytest fixtures for setting up HTTP servers during testing, configurable via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PYTEST_HTTPSERVER_HOST' and 'PYTEST_HTTPSERVER_PORT' used to determine server address and port.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; server start/stop methods are standard and do not leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during fixture setup to configure server address; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages server lifecycle for testing purposes with standard practices. It reads configuration from environment variables, which is typical. No malicious or maliciously intended code is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight elevation in security risk score (0.2) in some reports reflects cautiousness regarding environment variable reliance but does not indicate actual vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard test infrastructure with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
