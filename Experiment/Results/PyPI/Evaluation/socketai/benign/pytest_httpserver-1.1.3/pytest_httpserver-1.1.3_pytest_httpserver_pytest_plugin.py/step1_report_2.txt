{
  "purpose": "This code sets up HTTP server fixtures for testing purposes, allowing configuration via environment variables and managing server lifecycle during tests.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PYTEST_HTTPSERVER_HOST' and 'PYTEST_HTTPSERVER_PORT' for host and port configurations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; server start/stop functions and environment variables are standard in testing frameworks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to determine server address, then server objects are created, started, and cleaned up during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The use of environment variables for configuration is standard, and server management appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The script defines fixtures for starting and stopping HTTP servers, configurable via environment variables. It manages server lifecycle across test sessions, ensuring cleanup. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The code uses standard practices for test setup and teardown without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test setup for HTTP servers using pytest, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
