  "purpose": "To set up a local HTTP server for testing HTTP requests and responses",
  "sources": "Reading from the network (HTTP request to localhost:4000/foobar?name=John%20Smith&age=123)",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data received from the server response",
  "flows": "The code sends an HTTP GET request to localhost:4000/foobar with query parameters, then reads and prints the response",
  "anomalies": "Use of a test HTTP server (pytest_httpserver) within the script; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code; no obfuscated code present; the server is only used locally for testing purposes",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an in-memory HTTP server listening on port 4000, sets up an expectation for a specific request path '/foobar', and responds with a JSON object. It then makes an HTTP GET request to this server with query parameters, and prints the response. The server is stopped afterward. The code appears to be intended for local testing or development purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The use of pytest_httpserver is typical for testing scenarios and does not introduce security risks outside of normal testing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for local testing of HTTP requests using pytest_httpserver. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues. It operates solely within a local test environment, and there are no suspicious or malicious signals.",
