{
  "purpose": "The code provides hooks for pytest-httpserver, allowing modification of HTTP responses via delay, garbage addition, and chaining of multiple hooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as delay seconds, prefix and suffix sizes for garbage, and potentially the response data via response.get_data().",
  "sinks": "The code modifies response data by adding random bytes, and delays response sending. Response.set_data() and time.sleep() are key sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (delay seconds, garbage sizes) influence the response modification. Response data is retrieved, modified with random bytes, and set back, potentially after delays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secret data. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. Usage of os.urandom is benign for randomness. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements response manipulation hooks, including response delaying and adding random bytes, which could be used to obfuscate or corrupt data. No malicious behavior such as data theft, network exfiltration, or backdoors detected. The use of os.urandom is standard for randomness. All functions perform straightforward data manipulation or delays. No suspicious code patterns or external calls are present. The code appears to be a utility for testing purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for modifying HTTP responses in a testing environment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code.",
