{
  "purpose": "Provide hooks for pytest-httpserver to manipulate HTTP responses for testing purposes, including chaining, delaying, and adding random data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from os.urandom() for generating random bytes, and accesses request and response objects for processing.",
  "sinks": "Response.set_data() is used to modify response data, and os.urandom() generates random bytes which are added to responses.",
  "flows": "Random bytes generated by _get_garbage_bytes() are combined with response data via response.set_data(), potentially influenced by external calls or test setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It uses standard library functions and appears to serve solely for test response manipulation. No obfuscation or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for response manipulation in testing scenarios. Chain combines multiple hooks, Delay introduces response delay, and Garbage adds random bytes to response data. All operations are performed using standard libraries (os.urandom, time.sleep) and conventional practices. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's purpose aligns with testing response behaviors, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign testing utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It manipulates response data for testing purposes and does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
