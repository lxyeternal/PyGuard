{
  "purpose": "Provide hooks for pytest-httpserver to modify or delay responses during testing.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the request object; response data is from the Response object passed to callables.",
  "sinks": "Response data being modified in Garbage class; sleep operation in Delay class (potential delay or DoS).",
  "flows": "Hooks are called sequentially, passing response objects through Chain, Delay, and Garbage classes, potentially delaying or corrupting responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.urandom to add random bytes; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious domain connections or external data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines hooks for modifying HTTP responses during testing, including delaying responses and adding random data. No external network activity, credential handling, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The use of os.urandom is standard for generating random bytes and not malicious. The sleep function could be misused for DoS during tests, but not malicious in a malicious intent sense. Overall, the code appears intended for testing purposes only with no malicious or sabotage behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility classes for delaying and corrupting response data in a testing environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. It is a benign utility intended to simulate network conditions or response anomalies.",
