  "purpose": "Utility classes for manipulating HTTP responses during testing, including response chaining, delaying responses, and adding random data to responses.",
  "sources": "Response data accessed via response.get_data(); response modified via response.set_data(); delay introduced via time.sleep().",
  "sinks": "Response data modification via set_data() potentially affecting data integrity during testing; delay via time.sleep() could cause delays or DoS in testing environments.",
  "flows": "Response data retrieved with get_data(), modified with set_data(); Delay class calls time.sleep() before returning response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of standard libraries and straightforward data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides benign testing utilities for HTTP response manipulation, including response chaining, artificial delays, and adding random bytes. No malicious behavior, external network activity, or obfuscation is present. Use of os.urandom() and time.sleep() is standard and safe. The only minor concern is that the Delay class could be misused to cause delays or DoS during testing, but this is not malicious. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk≈0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for testing HTTP responses with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The minor security risk score reflects potential misuse but does not indicate actual malicious activity. Overall, the reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
