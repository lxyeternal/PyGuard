  "purpose": "Verify environment variable influence on pytest_httpserver configuration for host and port during testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables PYTEST_HTTPSERVER_HOST and PYTEST_HTTPSERVER_PORT, read during test execution.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing environment variable values to server host and port, influencing test outcomes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables set in fixture -> get_httpserver_listen_address() reads env vars -> test assertions verify values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward test setup manipulating environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables for host and port, then verifies that the server configuration reflects these values. The fixture temporarily modifies environment variables, restoring them afterward. Tests check that the server's host and port match the environment variables, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is simple, transparent, and intended solely for configuration verification. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The small security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports reflects minimal concern over environment variable manipulation, but given the controlled test context, this is overly cautious. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with typical testing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code verifying environment variable influence on server configuration. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior exists. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the minimal security risk score could be lowered to zero. Overall, the code is safe and poses no supply chain security issues.",
