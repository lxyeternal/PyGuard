{
  "purpose": "The code defines pytest fixtures and tests for environment variable handling of an HTTP server's host and port settings, verifying that environment variables influence server configuration correctly.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (HOST_KEY, PORT_KEY) used to set server host and port; no external input sources beyond environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables are used to influence server configuration, but no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations or code execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to configure the server's host and port, then used in assertions to verify correct behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected; code appears standard for test setup and verification.",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables to influence server configuration in tests, then verifies that the server's host and port match those environment variables. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code employs standard testing patterns with environment variable manipulation and assertions. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets beyond test variables, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test suite verifying environment variable influence on server configuration. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
