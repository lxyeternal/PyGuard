  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code verifying environment variable influence on server configuration. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior exists. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the minimal security risk score could be lowered to zero. Overall, the code is safe and poses no supply chain security issues."
