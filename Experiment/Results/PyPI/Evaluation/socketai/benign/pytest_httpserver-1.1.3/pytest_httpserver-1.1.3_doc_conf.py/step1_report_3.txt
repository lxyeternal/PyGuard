  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation for the pytest_httpserver project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and typing; reads environment and file system data during execution.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data manipulation or external system interaction are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to standard configuration reading and module imports; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. All code appears to be standard Sphinx configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file with imports, extension settings, theme options, and output options. No network calls, no code execution beyond imports, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The only imported modules are standard and related to configuration setup. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx documentation configuration script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
