{
  "purpose": "The code is a pytest test suite designed to test HTTP server behavior using pytest_httpserver and requests libraries.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include HTTP requests made with requests.get to the server URLs.",
  "sinks": "Data from HTTP responses are used in assertions; no data sinks for untrusted data or sensitive data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "HTTP requests initiated by requests.get flow from the test code to the local HTTP server and back as responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest fixture for server address, sets up request expectations on the local HTTP server, and makes GET requests to validate responses. It uses the pytest_httpserver library correctly without malicious patterns. The code does not contain hidden backdoors, malicious network activity, or suspicious data handling. No credentials, secrets, or sensitive data are hardcoded. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for HTTP server behavior, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
