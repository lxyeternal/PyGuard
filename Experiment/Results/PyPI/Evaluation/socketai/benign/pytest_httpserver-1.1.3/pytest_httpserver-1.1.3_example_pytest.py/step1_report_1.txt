{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script for the pytest framework, designed to test HTTP server expectations and responses using the pytest_httpserver library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables (not explicitly shown), and from the HTTP request responses made by the requests library during test execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points include the responses from the server to the requests, though these are controlled within the test and not untrusted input. No user input or untrusted data appears to influence critical operations.",
  "flows": "Test setup defines expected request handlers; during tests, actual HTTP requests are made to the server, which responds with predefined data. Data flows from the server responses to the assertions verifying the responses.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code appears straightforward, using standard testing libraries and conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a local HTTP server with specific request expectations and responses, then performs GET requests to verify correct behavior. All operations are within a controlled testing environment with no external untrusted data or command execution. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, controlled test script for HTTP server behavior verification. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this code. It functions solely for testing purposes within a safe environment.",
