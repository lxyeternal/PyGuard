{
  "purpose": "A pytest-based test script that sets up a local HTTP server with predefined request expectations and verifies responses using requests.",
  "sources": "HTTP server responses during test execution, specifically from pytest_httpserver mock handlers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; responses are predefined and controlled within the test environment.",
  "flows": "Test code sends GET requests to server endpoints and verifies responses match expectations; no external data flows or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured test suite for HTTP server behavior, using pytest and pytest_httpserver. It defines request expectations, performs GET requests, and asserts responses. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behaviors are present. The logic is standard for testing frameworks, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The response data is controlled, and no external untrusted input influences the test flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, controlled environment for testing HTTP responses. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should be 0, consistent with the analysis.",
