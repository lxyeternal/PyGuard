{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script for the pytest framework that uses an HTTP server to mock responses for testing HTTP client behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, requests, and pytest_httpserver; user-defined fixtures and test functions; HTTP request handlers within the test function.",
  "sinks": "Requests made to the local test server; responses are used for assertions.",
  "flows": "Test setup defines request handlers -> requests are sent via requests.get() -> responses are validated in assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; code uses standard testing libraries and patterns. No obfuscated or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a local HTTP server fixture that listens on 127.0.0.1:8000. It defines a test function that configures specific request handlers for various endpoints, then sends HTTP GET requests to these endpoints and verifies the responses. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for testing HTTP interactions. No suspicious code, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior patterns are present. No data leakage, backdoors, or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test script intended for HTTP endpoint mocking and validation. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
