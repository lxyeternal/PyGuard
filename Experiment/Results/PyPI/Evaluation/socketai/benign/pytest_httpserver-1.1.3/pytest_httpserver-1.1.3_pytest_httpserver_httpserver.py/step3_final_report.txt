{
  "purpose": "The code implements a mock HTTP server framework primarily used for testing and development purposes. It provides request matching, response generation, logging, and assertion capabilities to simulate server behavior without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Request data from incoming HTTP requests, headers, query strings, and URI matching patterns.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not perform data exfiltration, network connections to external domains, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Request data and headers are read in matcher methods; matchers determine request handling; responses are generated via registered handlers; logs record request-response pairs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive testing utility for mocking HTTP servers, with request matching, response handling, and logging. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or external data leaks. The request matching logic is based on standard patterns, and response generation is controlled and predictable. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign, testing-oriented purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured testing utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its minimal risk profile and lack of security issues justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) to account for potential misuse in testing environments. Overall, it poses no security concerns.",
