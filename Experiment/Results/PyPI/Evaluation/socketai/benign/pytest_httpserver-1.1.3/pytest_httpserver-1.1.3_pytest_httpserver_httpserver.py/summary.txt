  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured testing utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its minimal risk profile and lack of security issues justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) to account for potential misuse in testing environments. Overall, it poses no security concerns."
