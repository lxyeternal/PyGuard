{
  "purpose": "A mock HTTP server designed for testing, which handles incoming requests synchronously, matches requests based on various parameters, and responds accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads request data, headers, query strings, and request objects from the request queue.",
  "sinks": "Creates Response objects and passes them to request handlers; no external data leaks or unsafe sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Request objects are queued, matched against parameters, and responses are generated via request handlers; data flows are controlled within the server logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard, well-structured synchronous mock HTTP server for testing purposes. It reads request data, matches requests based on parameters, and responds via queued response objects. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The request handling, matching, and response mechanisms are typical for testing utilities. No external network activity or data exfiltration is observed. The code is clear, with no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The security posture is minimal risk, suitable for controlled testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious testing utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the code is safe for use in testing scenarios. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and accurate.",
