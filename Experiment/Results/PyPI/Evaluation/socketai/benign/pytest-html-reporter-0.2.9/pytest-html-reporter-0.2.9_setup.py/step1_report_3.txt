{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'pytest-html-reporter' that generates HTML reports based on pytest framework.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description, and standard setup parameters from package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; setup configuration appears standard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. It imports necessary modules, defines a read function to load a file's content, and calls setup() with package information. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling of untrusted sources. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected.",
