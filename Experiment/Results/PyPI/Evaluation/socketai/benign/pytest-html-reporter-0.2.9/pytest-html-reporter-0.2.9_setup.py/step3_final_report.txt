  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of the 'pytest-html-reporter' Python plugin, specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points for pytest integration.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.rst file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to setup() parameters; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected; read() function only reads local file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling. All modules and functions are used in conventional ways. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The static nature and straightforward structure confirm benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign packaging script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All indicators point to a safe, standard setup configuration.",
