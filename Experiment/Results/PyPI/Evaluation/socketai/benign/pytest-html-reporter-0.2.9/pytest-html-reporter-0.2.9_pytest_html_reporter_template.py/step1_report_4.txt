The code also accesses external resources via URLs for CSS, JS libraries, and images. Additionally, it reads document element attributes for generating charts and exporting PDFs.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"The code does not process untrusted input data directly; it primarily uses placeholders and external URLs for resources. The download link triggers client-side PDF creation using 'domtoimage' and 'jsPDF', which does not involve server data. No user input or untrusted data appears to flow into security-sensitive functions like executing commands or handling environment variables.\",\n  \"flows\": \"The main data flow involves placeholders being replaced with dynamic values, which are then used to generate charts, tables, and PDFs on the client-side. The external resources are loaded via CDN URLs, and the PDF generation reads the DOM element 'dashboard'. The script functions manipulate DOM elements and generate visualizations based on placeholder data, but do not execute code based on untrusted inputs.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code includes multiple external URL loads, which are standard for web apps but could pose privacy or integrity risks if these resources are compromised. The placeholder '__max_failure_percent__%' appears in CSS but is not used as executable code. The repeated 'document.getElementById(\"defaultOpen\").click();' calls could cause redundant actions but are not malicious. No suspicious code patterns, such as code injection or hidden backdoors, are detected.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code is a detailed HTML template for visual reporting with embedded JavaScript for dynamic content rendering, chart generation, and PDF export. It loads multiple external libraries, which are common for such dashboards. The placeholders suggest server-side rendering of report data. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system commands. The scripts manipulate DOM elements and generate visualizations securely on the client side. The use of external resources is standard but warrants trust in CDN integrity. Overall, the code appears benign, focused on presenting test results without executing untrusted code or leaking sensitive information.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The analyzed code is a comprehensive HTML report template designed for pytest results, with extensive client-side visualization and export functionalities. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. External resource loads are typical for web dashboards. The placeholders imply server-side data injection. The code is benign with a low malware score, but reliance on CDN sources suggests verifying resource integrity for enhanced security.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
