  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Generates an HTML template for pytest report, sourcing external CDN links, images, and placeholders (__variables__).  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Client-side scripts manipulate DOM, generate charts, download PDFs, no server-side or system commands.  \n- **Anomalies:** External URLs are standard; placeholders are typical for templating. No obfuscation or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a comprehensive, well-structured report template with visualization and export features. No malicious behavior detected. Reliance on external CDNs is common but should be trusted.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 (correct, no malware)  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2 (low, due to CDN reliance)  \n  - **confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence in benign nature)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" and no code.  \n- **Scores:** No code to analyze; scores should be zero or not applicable.  \n- **Verdict:** The report is invalid; no code to evaluate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, embedded scripts for visualization, external CDN links, placeholders.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Client-side DOM manipulation, chart rendering, PDF download. No untrusted data processing or server interaction.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious URL domains, placeholders are standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard report template, loaded with common open-source libraries. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 (benign)  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2 (standard reliance on external resources)  \n  - **confidence:** 0.95 (very high, given no suspicious activity)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, detailed templating with placeholders, external CDN resources.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Client-side visualization, PDF generation, no server or system commands.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious URL domains, placeholders are standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard HTML report template. No malicious behaviors detected.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2  \n  - **confidence:** 0.9  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, with embedded scripts and placeholders.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Client-side DOM manipulation, visualization, PDF download, no server-side or malicious data flows.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious URLs, placeholders are standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign HTML report template. No malicious activity or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **malware:** 0  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0.2  \n  - **confidence:** 0.9  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code verification:** All code snippets are standard HTML templates for reporting dashboards, with embedded scripts for visualization, interaction, and PDF export.  \n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. External resources are from reputable CDNs.  \n- **Obfuscated:** The code is clear, with no obfuscated segments.  \n- **Security risk:** Reliance on external CDNs is typical but should be considered; no other vulnerabilities detected.  \n- **Flow & anomalies:** No suspicious flows or anomalies; placeholders are for templating, not malicious injections.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, standard reliance on external resources, no significant security issues)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly reflect the benign nature of the code. The scores assigned are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with a benign, open-source HTML report template. No malware or obfuscation present. The low security risk is justified by external CDN reliance but is not a sign of malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores; they accurately reflect the code's nature.",
