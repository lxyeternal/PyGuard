  "purpose": "Import the 'screenshot' function from a local 'plugin' module, aliasing it as 'attach'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data reading beyond module import.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import source to alias; no data flow or execution beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement importing 'screenshot' from a local module 'plugin' and aliasing it as 'attach'. No data processing, external communication, or suspicious behavior is present. The security concern depends on the implementation of 'plugin.screenshot', which is outside this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious activity are evident, and the code is straightforward and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The import is standard, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based solely on this import statement.",
