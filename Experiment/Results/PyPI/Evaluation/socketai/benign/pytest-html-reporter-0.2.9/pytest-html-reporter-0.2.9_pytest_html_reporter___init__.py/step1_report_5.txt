  "purpose": "Import the 'screenshot' function from the 'plugin' module and assign it to the variable 'attach'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data output or untrusted data handling is visible.",
  "flows": "None, as it is a single import statement without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a function named 'screenshot' from a local module 'plugin' and assigns it to the variable 'attach'. This is a typical pattern for importing functions. No external inputs, data processing, or suspicious activity are evident. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger codebase where 'attach' may be used elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears benign and normal in context.",
