  "purpose": "Import a function named 'screenshot' from a local module 'plugin' and alias it as 'attach'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data flows or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in this single line of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no apparent anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'screenshot' from a relative module 'plugin' and assigns it to the alias 'attach'. This appears to be a simple import statement without any malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The naming suggests the function may capture screenshots, but that by itself is not malicious. The code is clean, and there are no obfuscation signs or complex constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard import with no suspicious activity observed.",
