{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface to run the 'solve' function from the 'advent_of_code' module with user-provided input, facilitating puzzle solving for Advent of Code challenges.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and standard input (sys.stdin.read()) for input data.",
  "sinks": "Uses the output of 'solve' function, prints it to standard output. No sinks for untrusted data that lead to security issues are evident.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (year, day, part) flow into the 'solve' function; standard input data is also passed to 'solve'. The 'solve' output is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The use of sys.exit with error messages is standard. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on command-line arguments, reads input from stdin, calls a 'solve' function, and handles exceptions by terminating with an error message. No external data is fetched or sent over the network. No malicious or malicious-looking constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical CLI patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI wrapper for the 'solve' function with proper input validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
