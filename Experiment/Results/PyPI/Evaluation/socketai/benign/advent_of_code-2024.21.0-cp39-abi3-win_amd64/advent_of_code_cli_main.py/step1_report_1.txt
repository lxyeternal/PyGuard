{
  "purpose": "The code acts as a command-line interface to run the 'solve' function from the 'advent_of_code' module, processing input from stdin based on provided command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and reads input data from standard input (sys.stdin.read()).",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'solve' function, which processes the inputs and produces output. The code also prints the result to standard output.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (year, day, part) -> 'solve' function with input data -> output printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or unusual code patterns are present. The code simply relays input to a solver function.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies the number of command-line arguments, extracts year, day, and part, then reads the entire input from stdin. It calls 'solve' with these parameters and outputs the result. Exception handling is implemented to catch and display errors. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The 'solve' function's internal implementation is not shown, but from this snippet, the code appears to be a straightforward runner script for the Advent of Code challenge.\n\nNo suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indicators are evident in this code. The flow of data is typical for a CLI wrapper, and no external or untrusted sources are involved beyond standard input and arguments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI wrapper that executes a problem-solving function with user-provided inputs. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet. It appears to be a benign component of a larger problem-solving framework.",
