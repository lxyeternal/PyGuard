{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface to run the 'solve' function from the 'advent_of_code' module with user-provided input, year, day, and part parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) for year, day, and part; reads input data from sys.stdin.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the result of 'solve' to standard output; exits with error messages if input validation fails or exceptions occur.",
  "flows": "Command-line args → input validation → 'solve' function call with parameters → output or error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Usage is straightforward, with input read from stdin and parameters from command-line args.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper that validates command-line arguments, reads input from stdin, and calls an external 'solve' function. It handles exceptions gracefully. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The input and output handling appears standard for a command-line utility.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical input-processing wrapper for the 'advent_of_code' solver. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The code seems safe and intended for standard problem-solving workflows.",
