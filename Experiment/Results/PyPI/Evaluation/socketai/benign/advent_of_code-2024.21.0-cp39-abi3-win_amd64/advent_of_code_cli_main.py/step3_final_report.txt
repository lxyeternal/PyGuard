{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI wrapper that validates arguments, reads input from stdin, calls an external solve() function, and outputs the result.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv), stdin input stream",
  "sinks": "The solve() function receives the input; no direct sinks in this code snippet",
  "flows": "Arguments are extracted from sys.argv, input read from stdin, passed to solve(), output printed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard exception handling and argument validation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python CLI utility that checks argument count, extracts parameters, reads input data, calls solve(), and handles exceptions. It does not perform network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted data beyond passing input to solve(). No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the risk score at 0, reflecting the code's safety.",
