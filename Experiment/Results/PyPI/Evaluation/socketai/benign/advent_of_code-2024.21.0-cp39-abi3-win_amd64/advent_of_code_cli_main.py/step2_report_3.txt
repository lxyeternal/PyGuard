  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that:\n  - Validates the number of command-line arguments.\n  - Extracts `year`, `day`, and `part` from `sys.argv`.\n  - Reads input data from `sys.stdin`.\n  - Calls an external `solve()` function with these parameters.\n  - Prints the output or exits with an error message if exceptions occur.\n\n**Security Implications:**\n\n- The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted data beyond passing input to `solve()`.\n- The `solve()` function's implementation is unknown, but the wrapper itself is benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical problem-solving CLI utility.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple CLI wrapper, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3\n- Slightly more cautious, assigns a small security risk (0.1). \n- **Justification:** The only reason for a non-zero security risk might be the use of `sys.exit()` with error messages, which is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 seems marginally high; perhaps 0.0 would be more appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Recommendation:** The score for securityRisk should be 0, not 0.1, unless there's an explicit concern about error message leakage or similar.\n\n#### Report 4\n- Similar reasoning, assigns securityRisk = 0, malware = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- Also consistent, with securityRisk = 0.1.\n- **Same as above:** Given the code's simplicity, the risk should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports agree on 0 malware and 0 obfuscated, which is appropriate.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0 for all reports.\n- **Security risk score:** Given the benign nature, should be 0 for all reports.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The only minor discrepancy is the assignment of a small security risk (0.1) in some reports, which is unwarranted here.\n- The reasoning that the code is safe and benign is sound.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type        | Value   | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious activity or code patterns present.            |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.          |\n| Risk              | 0       | No security risks; the code is a simple CLI wrapper.      |\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a benign, standard CLI wrapper with no security concerns. The scores should reflect that, with zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores.",
