{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to read input data from standard input, parse command-line arguments for year, day, and part, then invoke a solve function from an imported module to process the input and output the result.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdin.read() for input data",
  "sinks": "print() for output; sys.exit() for terminating the program with messages",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → variables; sys.stdin.read() → problem_input; solve() → output or exception; print() or sys.exit() → program termination",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; use of external solve function is standard; no hardcoded secrets or hidden code; standard exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the correct number of command-line arguments and reads input data from stdin. It then calls a solve function with these parameters and prints the result. Exception handling is used to manage errors. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple command-line interface that processes input and calls an external solve function. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this module. The code is safe and typical for a programming challenge or puzzle framework.",
