{
  "purpose": "To process input data for solving Advent of Code problems by invoking a solve function with user-provided arguments and input.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), sys.stdin.read() (standard input data)",
  "sinks": "solve() function, print(), sys.exit()",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments and stdin data flow into the solve() function; output is printed; exceptions trigger sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code simply manages input/output for a puzzle-solving script.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies the number of command-line arguments, reads input from stdin, and calls a solve() function with these parameters. It handles exceptions gracefully. All operations appear standard for a command-line utility designed for puzzle input processing. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are evident. The imports and function usage are conventional, and there are no suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward input-processing wrapper for the solve() function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
