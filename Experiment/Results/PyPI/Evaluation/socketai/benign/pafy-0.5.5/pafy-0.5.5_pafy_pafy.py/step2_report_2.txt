  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the source code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code manages YouTube data retrieval, environment variables, and network requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of recursion for retries is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is consistent; the code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to above.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious URL manipulations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, with standard network and cache management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 fit.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Retry logic is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly assessed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is conservative but acceptable given the code's network activity and environment variable usage.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, open-source YouTube content and metadata library with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard for network-dependent libraries with environment-based configuration)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with standard functionality, and no indicators of malicious or obfuscated code.",
