  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the overall security risk, then compare their reasoning and scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard network and API interactions. Uses recursion for retries, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious activity detected. The low security risk score reflects typical network-based code. The confidence (0.9) seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard API and network operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report; no malicious intent or obfuscation. The reasoning aligns well.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard API calls, environment variables, cache management, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar conclusions—no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors, standard network and API usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is reasonable; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard data fetching and caching.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious behavior was identified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0.2, reflecting a low but non-zero risk due to network activity and environment variable reliance, which is typical for such libraries.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — low, standard for network-dependent libraries with environment-based configuration.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code's logic is standard for a media-fetching library, with proper error handling, environment-based configuration, and caching. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, and the network interactions are typical for this use case.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the scores assigned in the reports. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2**  \n\nThese reflect a benign, well-structured open-source library with typical network and API interactions.",
