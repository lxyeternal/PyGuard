{
  "purpose": "Python library to download YouTube content and retrieve metadata",
  "sources": "Network requests via g.opener.open, environment variables (PAFY_BACKEND, pafydebug, api key), cache management, API calls to call_gdata",
  "sinks": "Data fetched from URLs, API responses stored in cache, potential data leakage if API keys are hardcoded (not present here), no untrusted data sinks evident",
  "flows": "Input URL or video ID -> fetch_decode retrieves data -> cache or API calls -> data processed for metadata and streams",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; recursive retry in fetch_decode is standard, not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a YouTube data retrieval library. It manages network requests with error handling, uses environment variables for backend selection, and caches data for efficiency. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The network interactions are typical for such libraries, and the use of recursion for retries is a common pattern. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external communications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source YouTube content and metadata library with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the code's functionality and structure.",
