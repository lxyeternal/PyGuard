  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, data flow, potential vulnerabilities, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently indicate that the code is a standard API wrapper for YouTube data, using call_gdata() to fetch info based on user input URLs or IDs.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code is detected.\n- Callbacks are used for progress updates, but they are invoked with simple strings.\n- The regex patterns for URL parsing are straightforward and do not appear to be exploitable.\n- The code's purpose is to retrieve and organize data, not to perform any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and logically consistent.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No obvious security vulnerabilities, though reliance on external `call_gdata()` assumes it is secure and trustworthy.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data handling:** Proper exception handling for missing data, no dangerous data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** No code indicates malicious intent or behavior. The API interactions are standard.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No obfuscation or code hiding detected.\n\n#### Risk score:\n- Reports assign 0.2, indicating low but non-zero risk.\n- **Justification:** The main risk stems from external API calls and user input handling. If `call_gdata()` is compromised or malicious, that could be a vector, but as-is, the code is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The callback functions are invoked with static strings, minimizing risk.\n- URL parsing via regex is straightforward; no pattern appears vulnerable.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.\n- The code relies on `call_gdata()`, which must be trusted; if compromised, could be a vector, but that is outside this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased if `call_gdata()` is untrusted, but based on the provided info, 0.2 is acceptable.\n- Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (acceptable given the context)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for YouTube data. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present. The current scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect the low likelihood of malicious activity, with the main concern being reliance on external API functions.",
