  "purpose": "Configuration setup for YouTube API interaction, including URL templates, headers, and API key.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded API key, URL templates, environment variables (if used elsewhere), input parameters for URL formatting.",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse of the exposed API key leading to unauthorized API calls, quota exhaustion, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Code loads configuration data -> API key is used in API requests -> Potential misuse if API key is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API key, no obfuscation, no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration and setup for YouTube API access. It imports modules based on Python version, defines URL templates, and sets up an HTTP opener with custom headers. The API key is hardcoded, which is a security concern but does not constitute malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or active network activity is present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score should be elevated to approximately 0.6 due to the exposure of the API key, which could be exploited if the code is shared or compromised. The overall assessment indicates a benign code snippet with a significant security concern related to credential exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malware or obfuscation but exposes a hardcoded API key, which poses a security risk if the code is shared or leaked. The scores are appropriate, with the malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the security risk score elevated to around 0.6 to reflect the potential for misuse of the exposed credentials.",
