  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily configuration/setup code for interacting with YouTube's API and resources.\n- The main security concern highlighted is the presence of a hardcoded API key (`AIzaSyCIM4EzNqi1in22f4Z3Ru3iYvLaY8tc3bo`).\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or active malware is reported.\n- The code does not perform any network activity itself; it prepares URL templates and request headers.\n- The reports assign low malware scores (0), indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are moderate (~0.3-0.6), primarily due to the API key exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Issue presence:**  \n- The API key is hardcoded in the code. This is confirmed in all reports and is a security vulnerability, but not malicious per se.\n\n**Code logic:**  \n- No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: consistently 0 across reports, justified by the lack of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- Security risk: varies from 0.3 to 0.6, justified by the API key exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points and potential adjustments:\n\n**1. Malware Score:**  \n- All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malware activity.\n\n**2. Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**3. Security Risk Score:**  \n- Given the critical issue of the hardcoded API key, a higher score could be justified, especially if the key were active or used in production.  \n- However, since the code itself does not perform malicious actions, and the risk is primarily due to exposure, a score of around 0.5-0.6 seems reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n- The main concern is the API key's exposure, which could lead to quota theft, unauthorized API use, or data leaks if the code is shared publicly.  \n- The current scores of 0.4-0.6 reflect this. I would suggest a score of **0.6** for security risk to emphasize the severity of exposing API keys.\n\n**4. Malware score justification:**  \n- No malware or malicious activity is detected; maintain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Issue             | Confirmed? | Reasoning                                                                                  | Suggested Score |\n|-------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | Yes        | No malicious activity detected.                                                          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | Yes        | Code is clear, no obfuscation.                                                             | 0               |\n| Security Risk     | Yes        | Hardcoded API key exposes security concerns; could be exploited if code is shared.       | **0.6**         |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard configuration module for YouTube API interaction.\n- The primary concern is the embedded API key, which should be stored securely or retrieved from environment variables.\n- No malware or obfuscation present.\n- The risk score should be increased slightly to 0.6 to reflect the security implications of the exposed API key.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.6\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis, emphasizing the security concern while confirming the absence of malicious activity.",
