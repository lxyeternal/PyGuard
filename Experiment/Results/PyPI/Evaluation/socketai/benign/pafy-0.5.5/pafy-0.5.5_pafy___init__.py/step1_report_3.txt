{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and imports functions and classes from internal modules related to API handling, playlist, and channel operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .pafy, .util, .playlist, .channel",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to critical sinks; mainly static imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module metadata definitions (__version__, __author__, __license__) and import statements from internal packages. There are no function calls, user inputs, external network connections, or data processing evident. All imported modules appear to be internal or local, and no suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are present. The structure is straightforward and consistent with typical package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initializer with no malicious intent, no external communication, and no suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a standard package setup script.",
