  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import specific functions from internal modules related to a multimedia API (likely YouTube or similar platform).",
  "sources": "The module imports functions and variables from internal modules (.pafy, .util, .playlist, .channel). No external data sources are directly read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are evident in this code segment.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code segment; it mainly sets up imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The versioning and author info seem standard.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet contains module metadata (__version__, __author__, __license__) and imports functions from internal modules related to a multimedia API, such as pafy, util, playlist, and channel. All imported functions appear to be for normal operations like fetching playlists, channels, and API keys. No user input, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with standard imports and metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
