  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import functions from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sources or untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. All imports are standard for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The code specifies package metadata (__version__, __author__, __license__) and imports several functions and objects from internal modules (.pafy, .util, .playlist, .channel). There are no functions, no data processing, nor external input handling. The imports seem to be for API interactions, playlist and channel data retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors within this snippet. The code appears to be a typical package __init__.py or module setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup and import declaration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
