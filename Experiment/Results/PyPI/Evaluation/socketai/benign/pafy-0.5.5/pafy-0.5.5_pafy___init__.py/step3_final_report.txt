  "purpose": "Module initialization with metadata and internal function imports for multimedia API handling.",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__version__, __author__, __license__); internal module imports (.pafy, .util, .playlist, .channel).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data reads or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Static import statements and metadata definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup file, defining metadata and importing internal modules. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The imports are from internal modules, likely part of the package itself, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and structure support these conclusions, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
