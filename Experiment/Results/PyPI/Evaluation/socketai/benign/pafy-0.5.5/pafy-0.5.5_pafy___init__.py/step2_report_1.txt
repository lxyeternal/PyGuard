  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any underlying issues are overlooked.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippet is a module's initial setup, defining metadata and importing functions from internal modules.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or user inputs are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident.\n- The imports are from internal modules, presumably for API interactions and data handling related to multimedia content.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No issues; standard imports and metadata.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as Report 1; straightforward package metadata and imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; just metadata and imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Again, only metadata and imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis**\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical package/module initialization file, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Potential issues:** No issues are present or implied that warrant higher scores.\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at **0**, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets include dynamic code execution, network communication, or handling of untrusted input, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided. The code is benign, and no security concerns are evident. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nLet me know if you'd like a further review of additional code snippets or specific security considerations.",
