  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import functions from internal modules related to external API, playlist, channel, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed; imports are from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no dangerous operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; the code only imports functions and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares version, author, and license information, then imports functions from internal modules. All imported modules are standard for package organization. There is no evidence of malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious operations. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package metadata and import declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It appears to be standard and benign.",
