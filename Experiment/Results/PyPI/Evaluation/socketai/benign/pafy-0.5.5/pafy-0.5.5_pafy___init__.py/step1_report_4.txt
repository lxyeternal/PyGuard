  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import functions from internal modules for external API interaction and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .pafy, .util, .playlist, .channel",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, as no untrusted input handling or external output occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard module setup with imports and metadata",
  "analysis": "The code sets metadata attributes (__version__, __author__, __license__) and imports several functions from local modules. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious operations are present. All imports are from internal modules, and no external network or data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only defines metadata and imports functions, which is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file.",
