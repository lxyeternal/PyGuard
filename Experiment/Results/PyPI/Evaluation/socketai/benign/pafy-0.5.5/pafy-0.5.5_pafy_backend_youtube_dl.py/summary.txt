  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media download utility with no malicious behavior. The primary security concern relates to filename handling during subprocess operations, which can be mitigated through input validation. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting minor potential vulnerabilities without active exploitation. Overall, it is a low-risk, benign implementation suitable for open-source use with recommended input sanitization practices."
