  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the script as a standard, benign setup.py for packaging the 'pafy' library.\n- No report indicates any suspicious code, dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The code only reads static files and version info, then calls setup() with package metadata.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code matches the original, and no malicious or suspicious modifications are noted.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; all reports agree on benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only minor note is that reading 'README.rst' directly assumes the file exists; if missing, it could cause an error, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n- No other issues are observed.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified by the benign nature.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code does not perform any actions that could compromise security.\n- It does not handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- The only external data is static files ('README.rst'), which is standard.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The setup.py is entirely benign.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
