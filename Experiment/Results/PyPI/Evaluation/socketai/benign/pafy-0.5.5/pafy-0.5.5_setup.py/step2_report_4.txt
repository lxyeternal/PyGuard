  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the script is a standard setup.py for packaging the 'pafy' library.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious imports are detected.\n- The code reads static files and version info from the package, which is typical and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears benign and follows standard practices.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports uniformly assign malware scores of 0 and security risk scores of 0.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), indicating strong agreement among reports.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be malicious or exploitative.\n- Reading files like 'README.rst' and importing version info are standard and pose no security concern.\n- The only minor point is that reading 'README.rst' directly could cause issues if the file is missing, but this is common practice and not malicious.\n\n**Potential issues or overlooked risks:**\n- If the 'scripts/ytdl' script referenced in 'scripts' is malicious, that could introduce risk, but this is outside the scope of this specific setup.py.\n- The setup.py itself does not execute any code beyond static imports and file reads.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe setup.py for 'pafy' is a typical, benign packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
