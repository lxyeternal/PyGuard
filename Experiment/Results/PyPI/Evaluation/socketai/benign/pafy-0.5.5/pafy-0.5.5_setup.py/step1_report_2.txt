{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pafy' Python package to package and distribute it via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading version from __version__, reading long_description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data execution.",
  "flows": "Input reading (__version__, 'README.rst') -> setup() configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Reading 'README.rst' directly for long_description may cause issues if the file is missing or malicious, but is common practice.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup tools and package version, then calls setup() with static and package data. No untrusted input processing, no dynamic code execution, nor network activity. Usage of package_data and extras_require is standard. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The script does not invoke any code from external sources at runtime beyond reading static files, and there are no indications of obfuscated or malicious code. All code and data references are typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
