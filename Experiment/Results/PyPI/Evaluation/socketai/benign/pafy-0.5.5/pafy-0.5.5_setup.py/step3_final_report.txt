  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'pafy' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Version import from 'pafy.__version__', reading 'README.rst' for long description, static files for package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, code execution, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Importing version info and reading static files without dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script that imports version info, reads static files, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed. The code follows standard practices and does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. All evidence and reports support this conclusion. The scores are justified and should remain at zero.",
