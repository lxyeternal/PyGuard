  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pafy' package to facilitate its distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'pafy.__version__', reading long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data used in critical security-sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Reading '__version__' from local module -> passing data to setup() parameters; reading file content for long_description -> passing to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and the version from 'pafy'. It constructs a setup() call with package metadata, including name, version, description, author info, URLs, dependencies, package data, and classifiers. It reads the long description from a local file 'README.rst'. All data sources are static or controlled within the package. No external input or untrusted data processing observed. No suspicious or malicious code present. The script is a standard package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py file for packaging Python code. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It solely prepares the package for distribution.",
