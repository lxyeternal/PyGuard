  "purpose": "The setup script for the pafy Python package, intended for packaging and distribution of the library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ from the pafy module, reads the long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The version is imported from pafy, then used in setup parameters; README content is read and included.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, importing version info from the package, and reading the long description from a file. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling untrusted input. The code appears to be a typical setup script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
