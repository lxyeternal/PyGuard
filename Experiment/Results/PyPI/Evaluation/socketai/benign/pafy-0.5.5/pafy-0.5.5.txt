      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media download utility with no malicious behavior. The primary security concern relates to filename handling during subprocess operations, which can be mitigated through input validation. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting minor potential vulnerabilities without active exploitation. Overall, it is a low-risk, benign implementation suitable for open-source use with recommended input sanitization practices."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate YouTube media utility with no signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.2) and malware score (0) are justified. It relies on external tools for remuxing, which is standard practice. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's operations are consistent with expected functionality for such a utility, and the assessments across reports are accurate and aligned."
