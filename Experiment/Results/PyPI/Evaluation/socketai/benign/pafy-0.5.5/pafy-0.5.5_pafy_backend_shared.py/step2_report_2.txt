  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard functions for extracting, representing, and downloading YouTube videos. Sources include URL parsing, network requests, and playlist data.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, subprocess calls (remux), file writes—typical for such applications.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flow or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is a typical media downloader with no malicious intent. The security risk is rated 0.2, which seems reasonable given the use of subprocess and network interactions, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard media handling, URL parsing, and external tool invocation for remuxing.\n- No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- The report concludes a legitimate library with standard security practices.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, describes standard media download functionality, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- External remuxing is a common practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, with focus on URL handling, network requests, and file operations.\n- No malicious patterns detected.\n- External tools for remuxing are used as intended.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion: legitimate YouTube media handling code, standard network and file operations.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. The code is consistent with a standard media downloader library.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws evident from the reports.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and risk scores as 0.2, which is reasonable considering the use of network requests and subprocesses for remuxing, but nothing malicious.\n- **Malware justification:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. External subprocess calls are standard for remuxing and do not imply malicious intent.\n- **Assumptions & vulnerabilities:** The reports do not rely on unfounded assumptions; they acknowledge standard practices and potential risks but find no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Score adjustments:** No adjustments needed; scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Wide Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (standard minor security concern due to subprocess and network operations, but low risk overall)\n\n**Overall:** The code appears benign, well-structured, and consistent with expected functionality. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a legitimate YouTube media processing library with minimal security risks, primarily related to standard network and subprocess usage.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.2**",
