  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate YouTube media utility with no signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.2) and malware score (0) are justified. It relies on external tools for remuxing, which is standard practice. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's operations are consistent with expected functionality for such a utility, and the assessments across reports are accurate and aligned."
