{
  "purpose": "The code is a YouTube video info fetcher and stream extractor, handling signature decryption, caching, and stream parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from fetch_decode (video info, watch page, dash data, JS files), regex matches, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "URL construction, cache files, network requests, and callback invocations.",
  "flows": "Source data (video info, watch page, JS) flows into signature decryption, URL formation, and cache storage; decryption flows through _decodesig to URL generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or malicious code; signature decryption via regex and JSInterpreter is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for extracting and decrypting YouTube video streams, including signature handling, caching, and network fetches. No backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. Signature decryption is performed via regex and dynamic JS analysis, which is typical for bypassing YouTube's protections. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is detected. The overall structure and logic are consistent with legitimate stream extraction tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven YouTube stream and info extractor with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The signature decryption and caching mechanisms are standard. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
