  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard YouTube info fetching, no anomalies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL generation, caching, data parsing, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic code analysis (JSInterpreter) and signature decryption are typical for this context.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Signature decryption and caching are standard operations.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate YouTube extraction code, no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.1, Risk=0.2 — reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on signature decryption and caching.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signature decryption and URL construction are potential points but are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; functions like _decodesig are standard.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; signature handling is typical for bypassing YouTube's protections.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purpose-driven code with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on stream retrieval and signature decryption.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signature decryption and URL generation are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No backdoors or obfuscation; signature decryption via JS extraction is common.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, primarily a legitimate streaming utility.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purpose-driven, no sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, with network fetches and caching.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signature decryption, URL construction, caching.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; standard techniques.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; signature decryption is necessary for protected streams.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same core functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signature handling, URL creation, caching.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code. The signature decryption and caching mechanisms are standard for such tools.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Minimal to none, as no obfuscation or code hiding techniques are evident.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero but low, reflecting the potential for misuse if inputs are manipulated, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.1** — very minimal obfuscation, primarily due to dynamic JS analysis, which is standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — low, mainly due to the potential if inputs are maliciously crafted, but no actual exploitation observed.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven YouTube data extraction module. It employs standard techniques for stream parsing, signature decryption, and caching. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are evident. The minor obfuscation is typical for signature handling routines, and the overall security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure input validation and sandboxing when deploying such code in untrusted environments, but based on the provided code and reports, there is no immediate concern for malicious activity.",
