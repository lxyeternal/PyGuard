  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard YouTube data extraction module with signature decryption, caching, and stream parsing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The report correctly identifies core functionalities: fetching video info, signature decryption, cache handling.\n  - No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident.\n  - The confidence score (0.9) seems appropriate given the detailed reasoning.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.1 (minor obfuscation in signature handling, but not malicious)\n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, due to standard operations)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing signature decryption, cache, and URL construction, with no evident malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The reasoning correctly notes the standard nature of signature decryption and cache.\n  - No suspicious code or network activity.\n  - Confidence is high (0.9), scores align with the analysis.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on legitimate functions, signature decryption, and URL generation, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The analysis is sound; signature decryption via dynamic JS extraction is standard.\n  - No backdoors or malicious behaviors.\n  - Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing network fetches, signature decryption, caching, and URL generation.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activities detected.\n  - Signature decryption and cache management are standard.\n  - Confidence remains high (0.9).\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a legitimate YouTube stream handler with signature decryption and caching.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.\n  - The analysis is thorough and aligns with previous reports.\n  - Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slight obfuscation in signature handling is acknowledged but not malicious; scores are low (~0.1).\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (~0.2), reflecting the potential for signature decryption and network fetches to be exploited if inputs are compromised, but overall low.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.1 (minor obfuscation, standard for signature handling)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to network and signature handling, but no active threats)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard YouTube stream extraction module. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** No adjustments needed. The overall security posture is low risk, with no malware or malicious obfuscation detected.",
