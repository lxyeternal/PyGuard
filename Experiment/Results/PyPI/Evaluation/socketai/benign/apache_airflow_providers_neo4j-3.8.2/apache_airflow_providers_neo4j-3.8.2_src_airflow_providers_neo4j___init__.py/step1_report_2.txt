{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and enforces a version requirement for compatibility with Apache Airflow.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported `airflow_version` from the airflow package and the hardcoded `__version__` string.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause security issues; the code only performs version checking and raises an exception if conditions are not met.",
  "flows": "The `airflow_version` is read from the imported airflow package and compared to a hardcoded version; if the condition is not met, a RuntimeError is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard version check with straightforward logic, no obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version information and performs a comparison to ensure compatibility. It raises an error if the installed airflow version is below 2.9.0. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious operations. It contains only standard version validation logic commonly used in package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version check for package compatibility. No malicious activity, supply chain attack, or security risks are evident.",
