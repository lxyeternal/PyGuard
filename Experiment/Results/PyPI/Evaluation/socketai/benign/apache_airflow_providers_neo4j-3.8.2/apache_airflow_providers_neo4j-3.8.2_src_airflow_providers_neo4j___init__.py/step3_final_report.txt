{
  "purpose": "This code enforces a minimum required version of Apache Airflow by comparing the current environment's version to 2.9.0 and raising an error if the version is insufficient.",
  "sources": "airflow.__version__ (imported from airflow package)",
  "sinks": "The RuntimeError raised when the version check fails",
  "flows": "airflow.__version__ is read, parsed, and compared; if below 2.9.0, a RuntimeError is triggered",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports airflow.__version__, parses it with packaging.version, and raises a RuntimeError if the base version is less than 2.9.0. It is a standard environment validation snippet, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The logic is simple and clear, and the exception handling is typical for such checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version enforcement check for an Apache Airflow provider. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and is safe for use. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a minor adjustment recommended for the security risk score in report 4, which should be set to 0 for consistency.",
