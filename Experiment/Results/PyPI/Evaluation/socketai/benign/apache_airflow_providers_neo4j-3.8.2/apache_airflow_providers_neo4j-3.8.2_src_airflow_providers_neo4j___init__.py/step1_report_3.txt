{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to define and enforce version compatibility checks for an Apache Airflow provider package, specifically ensuring the correct version of Airflow is used.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed Airflow version from the imported __version__ attribute and the package version string defined within the file.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version does not meet the minimum requirement, which could terminate the program if triggered.",
  "flows": "The flow is: read airflow_version -> parse and compare with 2.9.0 -> raise RuntimeError if version is too low.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors. The code uses standard version parsing, conditional checks, and error raising, with no hardcoded credentials or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version comparison to ensure compatibility. It imports required modules, reads a version string, compares the parsed version against a threshold, and raises an error if the check fails. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. It performs a simple, standard version check in a typical manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version enforcement check for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
