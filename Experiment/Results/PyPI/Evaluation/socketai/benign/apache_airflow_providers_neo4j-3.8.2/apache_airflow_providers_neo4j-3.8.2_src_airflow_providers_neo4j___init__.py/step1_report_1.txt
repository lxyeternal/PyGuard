{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a generated provider module for Apache Airflow, managing version compatibility and module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported Airflow version string (`airflow.__version__`) and the local `__version__` variable.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the RuntimeError raised if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which could interrupt execution.",
  "flows": "The flow starts from reading `airflow.__version__`, parsing it, comparing to a threshold, and potentially raising an error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code performs straightforward version checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads the Airflow version, defines a module export, sets a version string, and checks if the current Airflow version meets the minimum required version. If not, it raises an exception. All operations are standard and typical for package version validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version compatibility check for an Apache Airflow provider module. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply ensures that the environment meets the minimum version requirement.",
