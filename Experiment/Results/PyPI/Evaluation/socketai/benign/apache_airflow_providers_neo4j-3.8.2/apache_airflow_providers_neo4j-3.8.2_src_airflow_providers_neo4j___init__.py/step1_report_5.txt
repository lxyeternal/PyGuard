{
  "purpose": "The code sets up version compatibility checks for the Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring that the installed Airflow version meets the minimum requirement.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed Airflow version from the imported __version__ variable in airflow, and the static string version '3.8.2'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the version check fails, which is a standard control flow; no data leaks or security-critical sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the airflow version, parsing it, comparing it to a minimum version, and potentially raising an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices. The use of version parsing and comparison is standard. The comment indicates this is auto-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with license and copyright notices, then imports necessary modules. It imports the airflow version and defines a version string. It performs a version comparison and raises an error if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0. No external data sources, no environment variables, no user inputs, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The logic is simple and intended for version compatibility enforcement. The only potential concern is the raising of an exception, but it is a standard control flow for version enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version check for compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a simple comparison and raises an error if the check fails. Overall, it is safe and normal.",
