  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no dynamic or external data inputs.\n- No network activity, data leaks, or data sinks are present.\n- The code is straightforward, returning a hardcoded dictionary with package metadata.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- Dependencies and URLs are standard and publicly available, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk:** Given the evidence, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a static metadata provider, typical for package configuration files.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities based on the code are justified.\n- The dependencies are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The documentation URLs are legitimate and publicly accessible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and reasonable.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe, auto-generated package metadata snippet with no security concerns.",
