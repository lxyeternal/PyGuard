  "purpose": "This code provides static metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-neo4j' package, including version info, documentation links, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returns a hardcoded dictionary; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code is purely static.",
  "flows": "The function simply returns static data; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning package metadata with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code. It contains no obfuscation or malicious logic. The dependencies and URLs are standard and publicly available. The code's purpose is purely informational, and it does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and auto-generated for package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
