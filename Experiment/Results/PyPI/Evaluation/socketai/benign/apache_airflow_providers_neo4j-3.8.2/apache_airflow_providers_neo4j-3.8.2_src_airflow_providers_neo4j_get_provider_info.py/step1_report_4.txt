{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration details for the 'apache-airflow-providers-neo4j' package, including versions, integrations, operators, hooks, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returns a static dictionary; no external input sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or stored are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is purely static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and boilerplate in nature.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a hardcoded dictionary with package metadata, including version info, dependencies, and documentation links. There are no input/output operations, no execution of dynamic code, no network communications, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. The structure and content are typical for package metadata files generated automatically. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static metadata function with no malicious or security risks. It appears to be an auto-generated, benign configuration file for the Airflow Neo4j provider package.",
