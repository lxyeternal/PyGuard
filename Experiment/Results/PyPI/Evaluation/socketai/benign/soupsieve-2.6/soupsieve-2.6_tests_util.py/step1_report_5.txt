{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and test cases for parsing and selecting HTML/XML content, primarily for use in unit tests involving BeautifulSoup and soupsieve.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info (module imports, version checks), test input data via function parameters (HTML markup, selectors), and internal state variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, network, or files. It processes data internally and performs assertions; no data leakage or malicious output is observed.",
  "flows": "The flow involves inputting markup and selectors, compiling patterns with soupsieve, and parsing markup with BeautifulSoup using different parsers. No external untrusted data flows into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are found. The decorators and test setup appear standard for testing frameworks. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines test utility functions, imports parsing libraries, and conditionally skips tests if certain parsers are unavailable. It uses standard practices for testing HTML/XML parsing and pattern matching. No network operations, system modifications, or malicious code appear to be present. The code appears to be solely for testing and does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility module for parsing and pattern matching in HTML/XML content. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It adheres to standard testing practices and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious signals.",
