{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for unit testing HTML/XML parsing and selection functionalities using libraries like BeautifulSoup, soupsieve, and pytest.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, conditional imports of parsing libraries, and input parameters for functions such as 'markup', 'selectors', 'namespace', and 'custom'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data leads to security vulnerabilities; no network operations, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('markup', 'selectors', 'namespace', 'custom') into parsing and pattern compilation functions; results are used for assertions. No external data is transmitted or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code mainly consists of utility functions for testing with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing and HTML parsing libraries, conditionally handles missing dependencies, and defines test helper functions and decorators. It performs pattern compilation, soup creation, and parser availability checks. The functions are designed for testing correctness and compatibility rather than executing any external commands or sensitive operations. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious code is detected. The code appears to be a legitimate test utility module with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for testing HTML/XML parsing and selection. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. The logic is straightforward and solely intended for testing purposes.",
