  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security concerns, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** The code provides testing utilities for HTML/XML parsing, selector compilation, and environment handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The code uses trusted libraries (`bs4`, `soupsieve`, `pytest`) and performs standard testing operations.\n- The print statements are for debugging, not malicious.\n- Dependency checks and conditional skips are standard practice.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (low, due to potential for dependency issues, but not security risk)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. The overall risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on testing HTML/XML parsing and selector matching. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Same trusted libraries and testing patterns.\n- Use of print statements for debugging.\n- No external data leaks or network activity.\n- Dependency checks are standard.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (low, typical for test code)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Again, testing utilities for parsing and selector matching, with environment dependency checks.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- No network or external data activity.\n- Standard use of optional dependencies and test skipping.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low, just dependency handling)\n\n**Verdict:** Valid, no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** Utility functions for parsing and testing, with dependency checks and assertions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- No external data flows or network activity.\n- Standard testing practices.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Similar testing utilities, no malicious activity.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- No external system interaction.\n- Uses standard testing frameworks and dependency checks.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (test utilities, dependency checks, standard libraries), the risk is minimal. The highest assigned risk score is 0.5, which is reasonable for test code that relies on optional dependencies and debugging print statements.\n\n### Final justification:\n- The code is purely for testing HTML/XML parsing and CSS selector matching.\n- No network, file, or system modifications.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- Dependency checks and test skipping are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n- The print statements are for debugging, not malicious.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to dependency management and debugging output)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.
