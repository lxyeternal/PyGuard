  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions and classes for testing HTML/XML parsing and CSS selector matching, primarily using `BeautifulSoup`, `soupsieve`, and `pytest`.\n- It includes environment checks for optional dependencies (`lxml`, `html5lib`) and decorators to skip tests if dependencies are missing.\n- It contains debug print statements, which are typical in test utilities.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions/classes for testing HTML/XML parsing and CSS selectors.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, standard testing code, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** The score aligns well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, utility functions for testing HTML/XML parsing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious actions, no suspicious code, only debug print statements.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Also benign. No security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, dependency checks are standard, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) perhaps due to the mention of \"securityRisk,\" but still negligible. The code is standard test utilities.\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable given the context, but it should be kept at 0 unless there are specific concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for testing HTML/XML parsing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard test setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Testing utilities for parsing and selector matching.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious intent:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** The code is standard testing utility code, with no external communication, data exfiltration, or system modification.\n- **Use of print statements:** For debugging, not malicious.\n- **Dependency checks and test skipping:** Standard practice, not suspicious.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0 for all, except possibly a minimal 0.1 if considering the environment dependency checks as a potential surface, but even that is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     (or 0.1, but likely 0) |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign testing utility with no security risks or malicious behavior.**",
