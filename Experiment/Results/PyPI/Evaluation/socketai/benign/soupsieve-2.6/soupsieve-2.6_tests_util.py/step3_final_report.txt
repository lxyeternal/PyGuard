{
  "purpose": "The code provides testing utilities for HTML/XML parsing, CSS selector compilation, and environment dependency management, primarily using trusted libraries such as bs4, soupsieve, and pytest. It facilitates test setup, pattern compilation, and parser selection within a testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from test parameters such as markup strings, selector patterns, and environment variables for dependency presence checks.",
  "sinks": "The code processes selector compilation and HTML parsing internally; no external data exfiltration, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (markup, patterns) flows into parser and selector functions, with internal processing and assertions; no external sinks or malicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for debugging purposes; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of testing utilities designed for HTML/XML parsing validation, with dependency checks and test skipping mechanisms. It uses well-known libraries and practices, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The print statements are typical for debugging. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The dependency checks for lxml and html5lib are standard and do not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for supply chain inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate: malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) due to dependency checks, which are standard in test environments.",
