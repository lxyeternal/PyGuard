  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code presence, potential vulnerabilities, anomalies, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for testing HTML/XML parsing, using trusted libraries (bs4, soupsieve, pytest). No untrusted input sources are evident.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious actions; functions process data internally.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of print statements for debugging is typical; no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard testing utilities with dependency checks and skipping logic. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on testing HTML/XML parsing. No suspicious code, no external data exfiltration, no network activity. Use of print statements for debugging is standard.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (or very minimal, 0.1) — justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same general purpose, with dependency checks and test skipping. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), but still within benign bounds.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (acceptable, given the dependency handling and test setup)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Utility functions for testing, no external data leaks, no malicious code. All operations are within testing scope.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, with standard test utilities, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assigned 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All are either 0 or very minimal (0.1), justified by the dependency checks and test skipping logic, which are standard in test suites.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a benign set of testing utilities with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to dependency handling but still minimal)\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the detailed analysis.",
