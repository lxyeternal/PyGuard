{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for testing HTML/XML parsing and CSS selector compilation using BeautifulSoup, soupsieve, and pytest frameworks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (untrusted input source), uses external libraries (bs4, soupsieve, pytest), and reads environment via import checks.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions like sv.compile and sv.select that process selectors; calls BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML/XML; raises exceptions for invalid patterns.",
  "flows": "Selectors are compiled with sv.compile, then used to select elements from parsed HTML in bs4; conditional decorators check for library presence; errors are raised for invalid patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code performs standard testing utilities without obfuscated or malicious constructs. Usage of print statements for debug info is typical but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test utilities for parsing and selecting HTML/XML content. It includes conditional imports, skipping tests if dependencies are missing, and functions for assertions and pattern compilation. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The presence of print statements suggests debugging, not malicious intent. The import checks and skip decorators are standard. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility suite for HTML/XML parsing and selector validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only uses trusted libraries and performs expected operations within a testing context.",
