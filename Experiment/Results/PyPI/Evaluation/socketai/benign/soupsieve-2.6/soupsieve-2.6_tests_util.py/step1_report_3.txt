{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for testing HTML/XML parsing and selector compilation using BeautifulSoup, soupsieve, and pytest frameworks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (untrusted data sources are limited to standard libraries and known third-party packages), environment checks for optional libraries (lxml, html5lib). No user input handling or network data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows identified. No database or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The code mainly configures and runs tests, compiling patterns, creating BeautifulSoup objects, and skipping tests based on library availability. No untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. Decorators for skipping tests based on library presence are standard. All code adheres to typical testing utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of test utilities that facilitate testing HTML/XML parsing with different parsers, using pattern compilation and selector matching. It includes environment checks for optional libraries and decorators for test skipping. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are safe and standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as testing utilities for parsing and selector testing with no malicious intent or malicious code. It does not perform any network, data collection, or system modification activities. The overall security risk is minimal.",
