  "purpose": "This code is a trivial placeholder comment with no executable content or security implications.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment string \"Tests.\" with no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, untrusted data handling, or output operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist as the code is purely a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment string \"Tests.\" with no functions, variables, imports, or executable logic. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, with no potential for malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1—are appropriate given the trivial nature of the code. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder comment with no security risks or malicious behavior. The current assessment and scores are accurate and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
