  "purpose": "Test how BeautifulSoup handles nested list attributes in HTML elements.",
  "sources": "HTML string defining a <div> element; assignment of nested list [['a']] to the 'user' attribute.",
  "sinks": "CSS selector query using 'div[user=\"['a']\"]' to locate the element based on attribute value.",
  "flows": "Assignment of nested list to attribute -> string representation of attribute -> CSS selector query matching the string.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional assignment of nested lists to HTML attributes; use of print statement for debugging; no external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an HTML element, assigns a nested list [['a']] to its 'user' attribute, and queries it with a CSS selector. This tests BeautifulSoup's serialization of complex data types in attributes. No malicious code, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The nested list usage is unusual but benign, intended for testing edge cases. The print statement is for debugging. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (around 0.1) are appropriate, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless unit test exploring library behavior with complex attribute data. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The existing scores are justified; malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and risk score should be approximately 0.1 due to the unconventional attribute assignment but not security concern.",
