  "purpose": "Unit tests for HTML selector behavior, specifically testing the next sibling combinator.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'MARKUP' string containing HTML content and the test inputs for selector matching.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or data leakage are present; the code uses internal test data only.",
  "flows": "The test methods apply CSS selector logic to the internal HTML string to verify selector correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is standard test code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class with HTML markup and multiple test methods that invoke selector assertions. It relies on an external utility 'util' for the base test class and selector assertions. There are no external inputs, network calls, or data manipulation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code solely tests HTML selector functionality using static HTML data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for HTML selector behavior. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It appears to be a benign testing script.",
