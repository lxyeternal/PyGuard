{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying CSS selector behavior, specifically the adjacent sibling ('+') combinator, within static HTML markup.",
  "sources": "Static HTML markup within the test class, used solely for assertions in test methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; the code does not process or output data outside the test environment.",
  "flows": "The test methods apply CSS selectors to the static markup, asserting expected sibling elements; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured test suite for CSS selector matching, using hardcoded HTML and standard testing utilities. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The selectors and markup are valid and do not contain obfuscation or malicious intent. The reports' scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. No issues or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test suite for CSS selector behavior with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
