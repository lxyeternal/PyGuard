  "purpose": "Unit tests for HTML selector functionality, specifically testing next sibling combinators.",
  "sources": "The code reads the defined HTML markup stored in the MARKUP string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code performs static assertions on HTML content and selectors.",
  "flows": "The tests parse static HTML markup and verify selector matches; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class that includes static HTML markup and methods to verify CSS selector matching behavior. It uses assertions to validate selector results against static HTML content, without external input or data manipulation. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident; the code appears to be a straightforward test suite for an HTML parsing library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for verifying HTML selector functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
