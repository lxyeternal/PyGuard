  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether any scores need adjustment.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports uniformly describe the code as a set of static, benign unit tests for HTML/CSS selector parsing.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code relies on a utility 'util' and a method 'assert_selector', which are assumed to be standard testing utilities.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign description.\n- Security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the static nature of the tests.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The use of escape sequences in selectors (e.g., `span#\\\\34`) is consistent with CSS syntax and does not indicate obfuscation.\n- The tests are purely for verifying CSS selector behavior against static HTML content.\n\n**Score assessments:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation or malicious hiding is present.\n- Security risk: 0, as no vulnerabilities or sensitive data are involved.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports seem overly confident (confidence=1) about the benign nature, which is reasonable given the static, controlled context.\n- No adjustments needed for scores; they seem appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static unit test suite for HTML selector functionality.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Keep the scores as they are.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThese reflect the static, benign, and controlled nature of the code.",
