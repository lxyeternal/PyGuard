  "purpose": "Unit test verifying CSS selector behavior (:first-child) on static HTML content.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded HTML string within the test method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static test data used only for validation.",
  "flows": "Input HTML -> CSS selector application -> Assertion of expected elements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward test code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static unit test that checks CSS selector behavior on predefined HTML. It imports a utility module, defines a test class, and performs an assertion without external dependencies or dynamic inputs. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior is present. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static unit test with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
