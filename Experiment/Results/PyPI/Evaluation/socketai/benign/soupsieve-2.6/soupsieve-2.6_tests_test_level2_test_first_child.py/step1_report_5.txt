  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for an HTML selector utility, specifically testing the first-child selector.",
  "sources": "The code reads static HTML content embedded as a string in the test case.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input, nor does it output data externally.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the HTML is static and there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a straightforward test case with no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test case class that uses a utility method to test CSS selector behavior on static HTML content. The HTML contains nested elements, and the test asserts the correct selection of specific span elements using a first-child selector. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The code is well-structured and typical for testing CSS selector functionality. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign unit test script testing HTML selector logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
