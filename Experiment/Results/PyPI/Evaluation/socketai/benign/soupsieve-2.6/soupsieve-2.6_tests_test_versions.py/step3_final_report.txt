{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Version class and parse_version function from soupsieve.__meta__, verifying version string output, comparison, parsing, and validation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and Version object instantiations within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Test inputs (version objects) flow through comparison and string generation methods; no external or untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. Tests are straightforward and self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for internal version handling logic, with assertions on string outputs, comparisons, and input validation. No external network calls, file operations, environment variable access, or dynamic code execution are present. The tests use only hardcoded data and validate expected behaviors. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or supply chain attack vectors are evident. The code is clear, well-structured, and standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
