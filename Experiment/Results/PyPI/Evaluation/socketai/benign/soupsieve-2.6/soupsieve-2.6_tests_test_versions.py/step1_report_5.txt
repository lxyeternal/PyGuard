  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Version class and parse_version function to verify version parsing, comparison, and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Imports 'unittest', 'Version' and 'parse_version' from 'soupsieve.__meta__'. Uses test cases with hardcoded version data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Test cases provide controlled version data to methods and assertions; no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. All tests are standard unit tests for version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard unit tests for a Version class and parsing function. It validates version string formation, comparison, parsing, and input validation. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for version handling logic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard test code for ensuring version management correctness.",
