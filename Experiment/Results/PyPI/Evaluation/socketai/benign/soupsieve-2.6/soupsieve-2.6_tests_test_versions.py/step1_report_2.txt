  "purpose": "Unit testing for the Version class and version parsing functionality in the soupsieve package.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from assertions and test case inputs, mainly hardcoded version strings and version objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no external outputs or data transmissions occur.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; tests verify correctness of version comparison and parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing operations for version management, including version string generation, comparison, parsing, and validation. It only uses assertions to validate expected behaviors of the Version class and parse_version function. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The tests check for expected exceptions on invalid inputs, ensuring proper validation logic. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, straightforward, and intended solely for correctness verification of version handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing the version handling logic of the library and contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any network, file, or environment manipulations that could be malicious.",
