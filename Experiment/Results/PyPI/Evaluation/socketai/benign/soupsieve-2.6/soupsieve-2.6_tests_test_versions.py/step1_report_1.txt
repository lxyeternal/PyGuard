  "purpose": "Unit testing the Version class and parse_version function in the soupsieve package.",
  "sources": "Imports 'unittest' module, 'Version' and 'parse_version' from soupsieve.__meta__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; tests invoke class methods and functions internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests verifying version parsing, comparison, and string output functions. All tests are straightforward and involve only internal method calls and assertions. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. No anomalies or suspicious code segments identified. The code appears to be standard test code for version handling logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit test code for the Version class, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It performs internal validation without external dependencies or untrusted data handling.",
