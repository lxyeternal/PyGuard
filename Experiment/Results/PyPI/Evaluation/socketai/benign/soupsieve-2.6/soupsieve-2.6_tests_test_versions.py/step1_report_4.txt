  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Version class and parse_version function in the soupsieve package.",
  "sources": "Input data from version strings and function calls like parse_version.",
  "sinks": "Comparison operators, assertions, and exception handling that process version objects and input strings.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed by parse_version; Version instances are created and compared; assertions check correctness; exceptions handle invalid inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No network, file system, or environment variable access observed. All code appears to be standard unit testing procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for version parsing and comparison functionalities. It creates Version objects with various parameters, compares them, and verifies parsing correctness. It also tests that invalid inputs raise appropriate exceptions. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network access, or sabotage. The code uses assertions and exception handling as expected in testing environments. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite for version handling, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It appears to serve the purpose of validating version parsing and comparison logic without any security risks.",
