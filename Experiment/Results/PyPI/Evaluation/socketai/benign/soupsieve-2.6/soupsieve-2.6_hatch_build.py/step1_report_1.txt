{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads metadata from a '__meta__.py' file within a specified root directory and updates package metadata with classifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file at 'root/soupsieve/__meta__.py' using importlib.util.spec_from_file_location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code does not send data over the network or write to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "The code reads '__meta__.py' and accesses 'module.__version_info__._get_dev_status()' to incorporate version info into metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically importing a local file for version info is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a Python file '__meta__.py' dynamically from a specific path using importlib.util, then accesses a nested attribute '__version_info__._get_dev_status()'. It updates package classifiers with the obtained development status. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The approach of dynamically importing code from a local file is not typical but not malicious per se. The code appears to serve the purpose of flexible metadata management during package build.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for dynamic metadata extraction, with no signs of malicious intent. It performs expected operations for package setup without security risks.",
