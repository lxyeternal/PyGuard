  "purpose": "Dynamically load and extract version information from a local '__meta__.py' file to update package metadata classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads the file at os.path.join(root, 'soupsieve', '__meta__.py') and executes it via importlib.util.spec_from_file_location.",
  "sinks": "Executes external Python code without validation, potentially leading to code execution if the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Source: reading and executing '__meta__.py' -> sink: execution of external code via exec_module.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import and execution of a local file without validation; no input sanitization or sandboxing; straightforward code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a local metadata file dynamically, which is common in plugin systems. It executes the code within '__meta__.py' to access version info. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The main security concern is executing external code without validation, which could be exploited if the file is compromised. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4) are appropriate given the potential for malicious payloads. Confidence scores are high due to the straightforward analysis. Overall, the code is benign but carries inherent risks associated with dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for plugin metadata management with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is executing external files without validation, which could be exploited if the file is malicious. The assigned scores are consistent with this assessment. To mitigate risks, validation or sandboxing of the external '__meta__.py' file is recommended.",
