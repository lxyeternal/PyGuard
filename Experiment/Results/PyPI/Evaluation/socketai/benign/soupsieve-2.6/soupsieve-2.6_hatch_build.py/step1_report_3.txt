  "purpose": "Dynamically load module metadata from a file and inject it into package metadata during build.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a file '__meta__.py' located within the 'soupsieve' directory.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic import executes code from an external file, which could potentially contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code reads the '__meta__.py' file, loads and executes it, then accesses '__version_info__._get_dev_status()' to get version info, which is used to update package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.util to load and execute a module from a path, which can run arbitrary code if the '__meta__.py' file is malicious. No validation or sandboxing is implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads a metadata file from a specified path and executes its content. This pattern poses a risk if the file contents are tampered with, as arbitrary code execution could occur. The purpose is to extract version development status information without importing the full module. There are no obfuscated patterns or suspicious variable names; however, the reliance on external files executed at runtime is a potential security concern. The code does not contain any obvious malicious intent but does have a behavior that could be exploited if the source file is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to dynamically load metadata from an external file, which is inherently risky if the file is compromised. No malicious activity is evident within the code itself, but its reliance on executing external files introduces a potential attack vector. Overall, the code's purpose is benign, but it should be used with trusted files.",
