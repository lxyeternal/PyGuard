  "purpose": "Unit tests for focus selector behavior in HTML markup.",
  "sources": "Self-contained HTML markup string within the class variable 'MARKUP'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems; the code interacts only with internal test assertions.",
  "flows": "Test methods use the markup to assert CSS selector behavior; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class inheriting from a utility TestCase, with embedded static HTML markup. It performs focus-related assertions on HTML elements. The tests check whether specific inputs are or are not focused, with no external data or inputs involved. The code is straightforward and appears solely for testing purposes, without any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for HTML focus selector behavior with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
