{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for focus selector functionality in an HTML form",
  "sources": "The code reads the static HTML markup defined in the MARKUP variable",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present; the code only performs DOM queries and assertions",
  "flows": "The code tests focus states on input elements within the static HTML markup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward test code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static HTML snippet and two test methods that verify focus-related selectors using assertions. It uses a utility method 'assert_selector' to check the focus state of input elements. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data interactions, and no security-sensitive operations. The code is typical for unit testing front-end behavior and contains no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite for HTML focus selectors. It contains no malware, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is safe for use and does not pose supply chain security concerns.",
