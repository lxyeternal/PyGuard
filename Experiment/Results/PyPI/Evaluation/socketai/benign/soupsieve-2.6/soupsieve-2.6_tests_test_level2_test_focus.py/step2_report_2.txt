  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Unit tests for focus selector in HTML form.\n- Sources: Static HTML markup.\n- Sinks: None; only DOM queries and assertions.\n- Flows: Testing focus states.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward static HTML test code, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe, no security concerns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar focus selector tests.\n- Sources: Self-contained class with hardcoded HTML.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data assertions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Same as above; standard test code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Focus selector behavior testing.\n- Sources: Static HTML markup.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data testing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No dynamic or external inputs, straightforward tests.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Focus selector tests.\n- Sources: HTML markup with utility class.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static assertions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Focus selector behavior testing.\n- Sources: Static HTML string.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static assertions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports describe static, hardcoded HTML test code with no dynamic inputs, external dependencies, or network interactions.\n- **Malware:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security risk:** None; the code is purely for frontend selector testing.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n- All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No reason to increase any scores; the code is straightforward, safe, and free of malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign test suite with no security concerns or malicious activity. The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on the analysis, I would agree with the current scores: all zero, as there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
