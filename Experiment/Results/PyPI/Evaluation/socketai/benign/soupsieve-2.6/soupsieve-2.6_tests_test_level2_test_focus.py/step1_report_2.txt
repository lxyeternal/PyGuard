  "purpose": "Unit testing for focus selector functionality within an HTML form markup.",
  "sources": "Self-contained test class; no external input sources; HTML markup is hardcoded within the class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, network, or file operations; only assertions on HTML content.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test assertions only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class using a testing framework, with hardcoded HTML markup representing a form with various input elements. The test methods verify focus behaviors on inputs. The code solely performs assertions on static HTML content, with no external data processing, network calls, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward unit test class intended for frontend behavior validation. It contains no malicious code, no security risks, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The code is safe.",
