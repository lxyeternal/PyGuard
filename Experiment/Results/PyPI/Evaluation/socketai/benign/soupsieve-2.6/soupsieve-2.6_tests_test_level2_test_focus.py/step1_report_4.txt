  "purpose": "Unit tests for focus selector behavior in HTML form elements using a test framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports util, which provides the TestCase class and HTML flag; the MARKUP string containing HTML form markup.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static tests on predefined HTML markup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard test code with no hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class that inherits from util.TestCase, testing focus-related CSS selectors on static HTML markup. It uses self.assert_selector to verify behavior of focused elements, with no user input or external data involved. No dynamic execution, no input/output operations, and no third-party malicious activity. The code appears to be straightforward unit test code for frontend behavior validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of unit tests for focus selector behavior with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
