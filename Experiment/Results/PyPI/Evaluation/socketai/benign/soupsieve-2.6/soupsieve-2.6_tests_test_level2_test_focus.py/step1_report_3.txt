  "purpose": "Unit tests for focus selector behavior in HTML form markup.",
  "sources": "The code reads static HTML markup defined in the MARKUP string.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data inputs or outputs, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the test operates on static data, verifying selector behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward test code with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static HTML markup representing a form with various input and option elements, many disabled. The test methods use a hypothetical 'assert_selector' to verify focus states of input elements within the markup. The markup is static and hardcoded, with no external input or execution of dynamic code. The code appears to be a standard test suite for HTML selector behavior, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test for HTML selector functionality. It contains static test data with no external data input or malicious code. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
