{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying HTML/XML parsing and CSS selector functionality using BeautifulSoup and soupsieve, operating on static, hardcoded strings.",
  "sources": "Static HTML/XML strings within the test cases; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "The code parses static strings and applies CSS selectors; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static parsing and selector validation with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It uses standard libraries in a typical testing pattern. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The code's purpose is solely to verify parsing correctness, with no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the static, controlled nature of the code.",
