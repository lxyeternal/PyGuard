  "purpose": "Unit tests for BeautifulSoup and soupsieve to verify CSS selector functionality, XML namespace handling, and parsing accuracy.",
  "sources": "Reading HTML/XML strings, BeautifulSoup's parsing functions, and soupsieve's select methods.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No data is written to external systems or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Input HTML/XML strings are parsed by BeautifulSoup, then queried by soupsieve; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior present. The code is standard test code with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of test classes and functions designed to verify parser behavior. It uses standard library functions and third-party libraries in conventional ways. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The focus is on correctness of selector matching and namespace handling. The functions include setup and assertions typical for unit tests. No external network or file system access occurs beyond parsing provided strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of normal unit tests for the BeautifulSoup and soupsieve libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs no harmful operations, and its behavior is limited to verifying parsing logic.",
