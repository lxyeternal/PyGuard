  "purpose": "Assigns a version identifier for the package, serving as a standard metadata attribute.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to or send data anywhere.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the assignment is static and does not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, external calls, or complex logic. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The code does not pose any security threat or malicious behavior. The assessments are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
