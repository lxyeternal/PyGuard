{
  "purpose": "This code wraps OpenAI embedding API calls with telemetry instrumentation, capturing metrics, tracing, and request/response attributes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function arguments ('kwargs', 'response', 'prompt') and external configuration (e.g., 'instance').",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include setting span attributes with request prompts, response data, and potentially large or sensitive response content.",
  "flows": "Sources such as 'kwargs' and 'response' flow into span attributes and metrics; request prompts are also embedded into span attributes. Metrics are recorded based on response usage and embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses telemetry functions to record metrics and traces, but these are standard instrumentation practices. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code instruments OpenAI embedding API calls with OpenTelemetry, capturing metrics such as token usage, vector sizes, and duration. It uses async and sync wrappers, manages trace context propagation, and conditionally suppresses instrumentation. No external or untrusted code execution, no system modifications, or network transmissions are present. The functions mainly handle telemetry and metrics recording. No suspicious logic or malicious behavior detected; the code appears standard for telemetry instrumentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a telemetry wrapper for OpenAI embedding API calls, focused on metrics and tracing. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage behavior. The usage of telemetry functions and data handling is consistent with standard instrumentation practices. No security risks or malware identified.",
