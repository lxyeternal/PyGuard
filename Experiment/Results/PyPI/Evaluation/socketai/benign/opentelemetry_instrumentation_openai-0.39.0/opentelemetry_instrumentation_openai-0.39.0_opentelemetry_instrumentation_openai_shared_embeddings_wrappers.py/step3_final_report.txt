  "purpose": "Telemetry instrumentation for OpenAI embedding API calls, collecting metrics, span attributes, and propagating trace context.",
  "sources": "Input arguments ('kwargs', 'response', 'prompt'), environment/config variables, and internal function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Metrics counters, span attributes, and trace context propagation; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments and response data into metrics and span attributes; trace context is propagated as configured.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard telemetry instrumentation for observability, utilizing OpenTelemetry libraries for tracing and metrics. It handles exceptions properly, records durations, and sets span attributes based on input and response data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flows are limited to metrics and tracing, with no external network activity or sensitive data handling beyond telemetry. The code's purpose is benign, focused on monitoring API usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign telemetry instrumentation with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The low security risk score (0.1) accurately reflects the minimal risk associated with telemetry collection. No adjustments are necessary.",
