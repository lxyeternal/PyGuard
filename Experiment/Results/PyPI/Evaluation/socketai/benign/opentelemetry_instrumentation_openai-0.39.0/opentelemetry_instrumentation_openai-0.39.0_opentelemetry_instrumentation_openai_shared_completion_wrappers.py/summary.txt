  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured telemetry wrapper for OpenAI API calls, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the typical data collection involved in observability. Overall, the code poses very low security risk and is safe for use in production environments, provided that sensitive data is handled appropriately outside this scope."
