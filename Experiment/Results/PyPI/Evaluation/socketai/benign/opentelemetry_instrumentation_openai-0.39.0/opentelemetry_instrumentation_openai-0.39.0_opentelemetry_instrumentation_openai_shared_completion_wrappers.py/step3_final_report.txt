  "purpose": "Instrumentation wrappers for OpenAI API calls to add tracing, logging, and metrics collection using OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Request parameters, response data, configuration flags, and trace context propagation functions.",
  "sinks": "Span attribute setting functions, trace context propagation, and streaming response handling; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Source data (prompts, responses, request args) flow into span attribute functions; span is created at request start, attributes are set during request and response handling, and span ends after response processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; code is standard telemetry instrumentation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides synchronous and asynchronous wrappers around OpenAI API calls, managing tracing spans, setting attributes for requests, responses, and streaming data, and propagating trace context. It handles errors gracefully and conditionally suppresses instrumentation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The data collection is typical for telemetry but should be handled securely outside this code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, monitoring purpose of the code. The code's function aligns with standard observability practices, and no logical flaws or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured telemetry wrapper for OpenAI API calls, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the typical data collection involved in observability. Overall, the code poses very low security risk and is safe for use in production environments, provided that sensitive data is handled appropriately outside this scope.",
