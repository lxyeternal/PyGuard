{
  "purpose": "Defines an OpenAI instrumentation class that configures global settings and dynamically imports version-specific modules for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters set via class constructor; dynamic import statements within methods based on runtime version check.",
  "sinks": "External module imports and configuration assignments; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Source parameters influence global Config; version check directs import to specific instrumentor modules; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions returning static strings or empty dicts as default values; dynamic import inside methods; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets configuration parameters for telemetry, uses runtime version detection to import appropriate modules, and delegates instrumentation calls. Lambda defaults are benign placeholders. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code detected. The dynamic import pattern is standard for version-dependent plugins. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, benign instrumentation wrapper for OpenAI client libraries. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting standard plugin architecture considerations.",
