  "purpose": "Utility functions, decorators, and context managers for telemetry, error handling, version checks, and async management within an OpenAI SDK integration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., TRACELOOP_METRICS_ENABLED), imported modules, function parameters, and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, exception logger callbacks, and telemetry wrappers; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration; decorators wrap functions for telemetry; exception handling logs errors; threading and asyncio manage async execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; threading in run_async is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides telemetry, exception handling, and async execution utilities. It reads environment variables for configuration, uses decorators for telemetry, and manages async functions with threading and asyncio. No untrusted input sources, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. Exception logging is safe, and the code structure is straightforward. The use of threading in run_async is a common pattern for managing async calls safely. No obfuscation or suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for telemetry, error handling, and async management in an OpenAI SDK context. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain security risk is very low.",
