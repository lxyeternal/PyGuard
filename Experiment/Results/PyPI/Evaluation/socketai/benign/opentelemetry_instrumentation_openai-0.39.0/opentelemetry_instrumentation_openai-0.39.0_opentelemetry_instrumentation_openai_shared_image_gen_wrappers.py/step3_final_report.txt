  "purpose": "A metrics wrapper for OpenAI image generation API calls, capturing duration and exceptions for observability.",
  "sources": "Response object returned by wrapped function, response model info from kwargs, context flags for suppression.",
  "sinks": "Metrics recording functions (duration_histogram.record, exception_counter.add), shared attributes for metrics.",
  "flows": "Response response -> model_as_dict(response) or response -> metric_shared_attributes -> record metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward instrumentation code; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code measures execution time and exceptions for API calls, processes response data for metrics tagging, and respects suppression flags. It interacts with external telemetry libraries in a standard manner. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's purpose is purely for monitoring, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard telemetry wrapper for OpenAI API calls. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The current malware score of 0 and a very low security risk score (0.1) are appropriate; the risk could confidently be lowered to 0. The obfuscation score is correct at 0. The code's straightforward nature and lack of suspicious patterns confirm its safety.",
