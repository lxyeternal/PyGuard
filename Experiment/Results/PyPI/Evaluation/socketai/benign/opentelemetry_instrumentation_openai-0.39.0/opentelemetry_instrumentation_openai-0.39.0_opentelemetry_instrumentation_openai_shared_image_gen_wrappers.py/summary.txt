  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard telemetry wrapper for OpenAI API calls. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The current malware score of 0 and a very low security risk score (0.1) are appropriate; the risk could confidently be lowered to 0. The obfuscation score is correct at 0. The code's straightforward nature and lack of suspicious patterns confirm its safety."
