  "purpose": "Configuration class with flags and placeholder lambda functions for metrics and image upload.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; placeholders do not process data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; lambdas are placeholders with no actual data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The lambda for 'upload_base64_image' is improperly defined: it returns the 'str' type object instead of a string value, which is a coding mistake.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with boolean flags and lambda placeholders. The main anomaly is that 'upload_base64_image' is assigned as 'lambda trace_id, span_id, base64_image_url: str', which returns the 'str' type object rather than a string value, leading to a runtime error if invoked. The lambdas are placeholders and do not process any data or perform malicious actions. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity is present. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The improper lambda is a bug, not malicious code. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the minor coding mistake. No signs of sabotage or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor bug in the lambda definition that could cause runtime errors but does not pose a security threat. The scores assigned are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
