  "purpose": "Define a configuration class with various settings and callable attributes for handling tokens, metrics, images, and tracing.",
  "sources": "None; all attributes are either boolean flags, None, or lambda functions defined within the class.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The lambda functions used for get_common_metrics_attributes and upload_base64_image are placeholders with minimal implementation; upload_base64_image's lambda returns a str type annotation but does not produce an actual string, which may indicate incomplete code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines configuration flags and two callable attributes. The get_common_metrics_attributes lambda returns an empty dictionary, which is benign. The upload_base64_image lambda appears to be intended to return a string but is currently set to a lambda that merely references the str type, suggesting placeholder code or incomplete implementation. No external data input, secret handling, or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with placeholder lambdas that appear incomplete but pose no malicious or security risks. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
