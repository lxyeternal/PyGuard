  "purpose": "Definition of a configuration class with static attributes and callable attributes for a Python project.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines static attributes and lambda functions with no input data reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The lambda functions assigned to get_common_metrics_attributes and upload_base64_image could potentially be sinks if invoked with untrusted input, but as defined, they are simple lambdas returning empty dict or string.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the lambdas are static or default placeholders with no internal data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambdas with default implementations that return fixed values (empty dict and string), but these are standard placeholders and not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Config' with boolean flags, a logger placeholder, and two lambda functions as attributes with default simple implementations. The lambda functions could be invoked with external data, but as given, they are harmless placeholders. No input reading, no data leaks, no suspicious code logic. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration class with default placeholder functions. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. It is a standard pattern for configurable application settings.",
