  "purpose": "Define a configuration class with various settings and callable attributes for a Python application.",
  "sources": "Module-level attribute assignments within the Config class, including lambda functions.",
  "sinks": "The lambda functions assigned to get_common_metrics_attributes and upload_base64_image, which could potentially process untrusted input if misused.",
  "flows": "Any external data passed to get_common_metrics_attributes or upload_base64_image could flow into processing functions; however, in this code, these are placeholders and not actively invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The lambda assigned to upload_base64_image is defined to return a string but is improperly specified: 'lambda trace_id, span_id, base64_image_url: str' returns a type object rather than an actual string or value, which suggests a coding mistake rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class with boolean flags and two callable attributes. The get_common_metrics_attributes is a safe placeholder returning an empty dictionary. The upload_base64_image lambda is incorrectly implemented; it appears to intend to return a string but instead returns the 'str' type object, which is a coding error rather than malicious code. No evidence of data leakage, malicious data processing, or security risks is apparent. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with a minor implementation mistake in the lambda function. There is no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risk evident. The mistake is likely a bug rather than malicious code.",
