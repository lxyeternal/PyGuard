  "purpose": "Define a configuration class with default settings and function placeholders for a larger application.",
  "sources": "None; no data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns default values and lambda functions.",
  "anomalies": "The lambda for 'upload_base64_image' is defined to return a string, but it lacks an implementation or actual return statement, which may be misleading but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Config' with class variables serving as configuration flags and placeholders for functions. The 'get_common_metrics_attributes' lambda returns an empty dict, and 'upload_base64_image' lambda declares parameters and a return type annotation but does not execute any code or contain logic. There are no inputs, outputs, or data handling mechanisms that could be exploited. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration container with placeholder functions, not exhibiting any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration holder with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It provides placeholders for functions that should be implemented elsewhere. There are no anomalies or malicious patterns observed.",
