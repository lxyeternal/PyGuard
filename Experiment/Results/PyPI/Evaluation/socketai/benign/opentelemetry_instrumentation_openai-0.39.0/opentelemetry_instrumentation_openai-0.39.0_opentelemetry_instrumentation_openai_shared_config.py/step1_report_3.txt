  "purpose": "Define a configuration class with default settings and function placeholders for a larger application.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "targets": "None; the code does not interact with external systems or data sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of lambda functions with ambiguous return types; the 'upload_base64_image' lambda appears to be improperly defined, returning a string literal 'str' instead of a string value. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Config' with class variables, some of which are function placeholders with type annotations. The 'get_common_metrics_attributes' lambda returns an empty dictionary, which is safe. The 'upload_base64_image' lambda, however, is assigned to a lambda that takes three string arguments but returns the literal 'str', which is not functional code and likely a mistake or placeholder. The rest are boolean flags and an optional logger. No input or output data handling, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a configuration setup with placeholders for functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only minor concern is the incomplete lambda for 'upload_base64_image', which seems to be a placeholder rather than malicious code.",
