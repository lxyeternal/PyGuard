{
  "purpose": "The code initializes instrumentation for the OpenAI SDK, adding monitoring and tracing capabilities using OpenTelemetry libraries.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, environment variables (via kwargs), and external OpenAI SDK modules.",
  "sinks": "Wrapped functions may send tracing or metrics data to external monitoring systems; no direct data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from SDK calls flows through wrapper functions that collect metrics or traces, with no evidence of data being sent externally or maliciously altered.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code primarily sets up instrumentation wrappers and metrics collection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports monitoring libraries and defines a class to instrument OpenAI SDK calls for telemetry purposes. It wraps various SDK functions to collect metrics and traces, conditioned on feature flags. The code uses standard patterns for adding instrumentation, with no indication of malicious logic or data exfiltration. Error handling is limited to skipping optional beta API wrappers if unavailable, which is normal. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate instrumentation setup for monitoring OpenAI SDK operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate metrics and trace collection, with no evidence of malicious data flow or sabotage.",
