{
  "purpose": "The code provides data mapping and processing functions for music-related data, transforming raw API data into a standardized format for use in an application.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from parameters of various mapping functions, typically dictionaries representing music entities such as tracks, albums, artists, playlists, etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security issues; the code mainly constructs URLs, processes data, and returns structured objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through transformation functions that produce structured dictionaries; no external or untrusted data flows into system commands or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses regex for string cleanup but only for standard text processing; no obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious activity is evident. The only minor concern could be dynamic URL construction, but it is based on input data presumed to be from trusted sources.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs data mapping and formatting based on input dictionaries, converting API data into a predefined schema. It contains no code that executes system commands, interacts with filesystems, or performs network operations apart from URL construction. The only external interaction is URL creation for media resources, which are based on input data and do not involve executing untrusted code. The 'clean_search_query' function uses regex for string cleanup, but this is standard and safe. No suspicious patterns, code injection vectors, or malicious logic are present. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, safe data processing layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data transformation functions with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It is primarily responsible for formatting and standardizing data structures. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities within this module.",
