{
  "purpose": "The code provides data transformation functions for music-related data, mapping raw API responses into structured formats with URL generation and search query cleanup.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries containing music data such as tracks, albums, artists, playlists, and search terms.",
  "sinks": "URL strings and data structures used for API responses; no network or file operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input dictionaries, processed through string manipulations and URL concatenations, then output as structured dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Regex used for search query cleanup could potentially be exploited if user input is malicious, but it is standard string replacement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple data mapping functions that convert raw API data into structured formats, primarily constructing URLs and sanitizing search terms. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Regex operations are straightforward and used for string cleanup, which is safe. The code does not execute external code or handle secrets. The only minor concern is the regex-based cleanup, which could be manipulated if input is malicious, but this is a common practice and not inherently dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data transformation module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score of 0.2 reflects the potential for input manipulation in search cleanup but does not indicate actual malicious intent.",
