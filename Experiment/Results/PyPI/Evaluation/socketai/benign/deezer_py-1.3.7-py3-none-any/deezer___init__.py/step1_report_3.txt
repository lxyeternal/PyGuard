{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client interface for Deezer, allowing login, account management, and track URL retrieval functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data includes user credentials (email, password, reCaptcha token, ARL cookie), session cookies, and track tokens.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include POST requests to Deezer APIs, where user credentials and session cookies are sent, and URLs for media streams are retrieved.",
  "flows": "Source data (user credentials or ARL cookie) flows into login or session setup functions, resulting in authenticated requests to fetch track URLs. Session cookies and user data flow into session management and account switching logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard requests and cookie management. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are evident. It handles user data and session tokens securely. No network connections to suspicious domains or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a Deezer client class with functions for login (via credentials or ARL cookie), session management, account switching, and retrieving media URLs. It employs standard HTTP requests and cookie handling, with checks for login success and proper error handling. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are visible. The URL retrieval function interacts with Deezer's media service, which is expected for authorized media streaming. There are no indications of malware behavior like data theft or reverse shells.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Deezer API client implementation without malicious intent. It performs expected functions for a media service client, with appropriate session and error management. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected.",
