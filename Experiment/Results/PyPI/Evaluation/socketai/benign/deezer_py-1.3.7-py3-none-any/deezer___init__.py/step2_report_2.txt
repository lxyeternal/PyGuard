  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Python client for Deezer, handling login, session, and track URL retrieval. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. Confidence is high (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  - The code uses requests for HTTP, manages sessions and cookies, performs login via credentials or ARL, and fetches track URLs.  \n  - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious API interactions are evident.  \n  - The functions perform expected tasks: login, session management, track URL retrieval.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.  \n  - No issues detected.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (low, as it handles credentials but is standard for such clients)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client behavior, no signs of malicious activity, with a confidence of 0.9 and malware score 0.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  - Same as above, the code manages login, session, and track URL retrieval securely.  \n  - No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - Consistent with code analysis.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (slightly higher, but still low, due to handling user data)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  - Same as above, no hidden behaviors or suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - Consistent with code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard Deezer API client, no malicious intent, no obfuscation, confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API wrapper with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  - No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hidden network activity beyond legitimate API calls.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - Consistent with the code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code is straightforward, readable, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher than 0 but still low, reflecting the handling of user credentials and session cookies. The scores of 0.1–0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (standard risk for client code handling user credentials and session cookies)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured client for Deezer's API, with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues detected. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.",
