{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python client for Deezer's API, handling login (via credentials or ARL cookies), session management, account switching, and track URL retrieval. It manages user data and session cookies securely, performing standard API interactions expected for such a client.",
  "sources": "Reads user input for login credentials, ARL cookies, and session cookies; interacts with Deezer's API endpoints for user data, media URLs, and account info.",
  "sinks": "Uses network requests to Deezer's domains; no untrusted data is sent beyond legitimate API calls; no data exfiltration or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "flows": "User inputs (credentials or ARL) lead to session cookies and user data retrieval; session cookies and tokens flow into API requests for media URLs; user data flows into account management functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client managing user login, session, and media URL retrieval. It uses requests sessions, manages cookies, and interacts with Deezer's API endpoints in a typical manner. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. Error handling is minimal but sufficient for the scope. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden code structures. It handles sensitive data (credentials, cookies) appropriately, but this is expected for such clients. The network interactions are with legitimate Deezer domains, and no suspicious data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of a Deezer API client with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting typical handling of sensitive data without malicious behavior.",
