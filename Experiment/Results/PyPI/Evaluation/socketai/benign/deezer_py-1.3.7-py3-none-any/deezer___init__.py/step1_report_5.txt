{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python interface for interacting with Deezer's API, enabling login, session management, and retrieval of track URLs.",
  "sources": "Input data includes user credentials (email, password, reCaptcha token), ARL tokens, and session cookies.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive data like cookies and license tokens are stored and used for API requests; track URLs are retrieved from API responses.",
  "flows": "User input (credentials, ARL tokens) influences session cookies and API request payloads, leading to retrieval of track URLs and user data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious obfuscated code; usage of requests.Session for session handling is standard; license tokens and cookies are managed securely; no dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard API wrapper for Deezer with functions for login (via credentials or ARL token), session management, and track URL retrieval. It uses requests for HTTP communication, manages session cookies, and performs data validation. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code handles user data securely, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic. It also does not perform any network connections beyond API calls, nor does it exfiltrate data. The use of API and session objects aligns with common practices. Overall, the code performs legitimate API interactions without indications of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for Deezer, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It manages user sessions and retrieves media URLs securely, with standard coding practices. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage found.",
