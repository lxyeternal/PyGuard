  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes a standard API client for Deezer, with data flowing from API responses to internal structures, no hardcoded secrets, standard error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious intent detected; recursive retries are standard for network robustness. No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report confidently states the code is legitimate, with a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The logic is sound; no malicious activity is evident.  \n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- The security risk score (0.2) reflects minor concerns about potential infinite retries but is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions, with potential sensitive data in responses but no exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns; standard token management and retries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with previous findings; no malware signals.  \n- The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Focused on retrieving and managing media data, with potential untrusted inputs influencing API requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets; standard API usage; no malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior; malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The logic is straightforward, and no malicious activity is indicated.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar API client with standard operations; potential for misuse exists if inputs are malicious, but no malicious code is present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns; standard retry logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious signals; malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent detected.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to others, with potential for malicious manipulation of user data or API calls, but no evidence of malicious payloads.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or backdoors; standard API interactions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior; malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The logic and findings are consistent; scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—standard API client with no malicious payloads or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting minor concerns about potential infinite retries, but these are standard network resilience patterns, not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The code is a legitimate API client with no malicious or obfuscated features.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to retry logic, but not a serious risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's behavior.",
