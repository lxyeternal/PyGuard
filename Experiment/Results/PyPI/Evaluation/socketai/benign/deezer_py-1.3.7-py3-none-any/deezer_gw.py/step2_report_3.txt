  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: code functionality, potential vulnerabilities, malicious indicators, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client for Deezer, handling token management, data retrieval, and modifications. No malicious activity or backdoors are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The low risk score reflects minor concerns like potential infinite retries, which are standard in network code.\n- **Justification:** Given the absence of suspicious behavior, the low scores are appropriate. The recursive retry pattern, while potentially problematic if unbounded, is a common resilience technique, not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming that the code is a legitimate API wrapper with no malicious intent. The analysis emphasizes standard API interactions, token management, and error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious indicators, no hardcoded secrets, and standard practices.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with no signs of malicious behavior. The focus is on data retrieval, token handling, and error retries.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The reasoning aligns with the lack of malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical API wrapper with no malicious or suspicious activity. It handles user data, playlists, and media with standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The risk score is low, acknowledging potential network error retries but not malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious signals or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages user data and media via API calls, with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs data modifications and retrievals with standard error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The low risk reflects standard API wrapper concerns.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports, reflecting minor concerns like potential infinite retries, but nothing serious.\n\n### My Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor network error handling concerns, not security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client for Deezer with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is justified given the standard network resilience patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:** No changes needed. The current scores accurately reflect the code's nature and security posture.",
