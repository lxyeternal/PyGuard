      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of a Deezer API client with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting typical handling of sensitive data without malicious behavior."
