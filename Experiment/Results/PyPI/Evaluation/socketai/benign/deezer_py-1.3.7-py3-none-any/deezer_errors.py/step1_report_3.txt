  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to Deezer API interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance hierarchies; no input reading or data fetching.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising mechanisms; no data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow as this is class definition code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or malicious code; no hardcoded secrets, no network operations, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from base exception classes. Each class is used for specific error scenarios such as license issues, geolocation restrictions, API errors, and permission problems. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The structure appears to be a standard error-handling setup for a larger application or library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes for error handling related to Deezer API interactions. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or suspicious anomalies present. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation of exception hierarchy.",
