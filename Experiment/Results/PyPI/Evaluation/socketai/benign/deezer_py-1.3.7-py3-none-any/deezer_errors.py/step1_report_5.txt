{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the Deezer API and its functionalities.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; all data is internal within exception constructors and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; primarily class definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in Exception classes. It includes constructors that assign message strings and store relevant parameters, but these are straightforward and standard. No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure is typical for error handling modules, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, the code appears safe and intended solely for error management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling within the Deezer API context. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
