  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Deezer API error handling",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions only",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow; only exception class declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code activities",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of Python class definitions for custom exceptions related to Deezer API errors. It includes exception inheritance, message formatting, and class structure without any input handling, data processing, or external communication. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The code appears to serve as a structured exception framework for error handling in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for API error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalous or suspicious code elements.",
