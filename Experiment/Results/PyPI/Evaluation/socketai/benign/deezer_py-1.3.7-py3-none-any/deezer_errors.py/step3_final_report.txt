  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Deezer API errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "No data input, external data, or network calls; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class hierarchy with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base exception classes, with constructors setting message attributes. No input/output, network activity, or data processing occurs. The structure is standard for error handling modules. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The exception classes are simple, clear, and do not embed payloads or backdoors. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
