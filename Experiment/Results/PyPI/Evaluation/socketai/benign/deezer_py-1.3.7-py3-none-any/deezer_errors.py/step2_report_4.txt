  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the scoring, and potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Deezer API errors.\n- No input/output operations, data processing, network calls, or external dependencies are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from base exception classes, with some constructors setting messages and attributes.\n\n**Review of Each Report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes.\n- Analysis: Accurate; no malicious activity or anomalies.\n- Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- Justification: The code is purely declarative, standard for error handling.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- No issues identified.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on specific error scenarios; same conclusions.\n- No malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the same; straightforward exception class definitions.\n- No suspicious elements.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis; standard exception hierarchy.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
