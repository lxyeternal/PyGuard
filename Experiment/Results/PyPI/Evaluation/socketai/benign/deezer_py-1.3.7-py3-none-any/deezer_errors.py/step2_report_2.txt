  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling various Deezer API errors.\n- All classes inherit from base exception classes (`DeezerError`, `APIError`, `GWAPIError`).\n- Exception classes include constructors that set message strings and store relevant parameters.\n- The code is purely declarative, with no input/output, network calls, or data processing.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code elements are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for exception handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Are the risk scores appropriate?**  \n  **Yes.** Given the absence of any malicious activity, the risk scores are justified as zero.\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  **No.** The reports do not speculate beyond the evidence; they correctly identify that the code is purely for exception handling.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the code?**  \n  **Yes.** All scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential hidden malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward class definitions with no embedded payloads or obfuscated logic.\n\n- **Could the message formatting or exception hierarchy introduce security issues?**  \n  **No.** The message strings are static and do not involve user input or dynamic data that could lead to injection vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risk, as the code is purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in an API context. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the thorough analysis provided in all reports.",
