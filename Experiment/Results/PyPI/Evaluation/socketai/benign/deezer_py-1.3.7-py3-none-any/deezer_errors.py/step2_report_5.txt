  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Deezer API error handling.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or external data is involved.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code elements are present.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from base exception classes, with no signs of embedded payloads or backdoors.\n- The scores assigned for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero across reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions with no runtime or external interactions. No issues are present or implied.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero, no justification is necessary. The code is not risky.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or present; the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state the code's purpose and safety.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, safe set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The assessments are accurate and well-justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action needed. The code is benign and correctly classified as such.",
