  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Deezer API error handling.\n- No input/output, data processing, network calls, or external data flows are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code elements are identified.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from base classes, with no complex logic or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Review of individual reports:**\n- Each report assigns a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0.\n- The conclusions are aligned: the code appears benign, standard, and safe.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activities are claimed or detected.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk score: 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n**Any issues or points of concern?**\n- The code is purely declarative, defining exception classes, which is typical for error handling modules.\n- No claims or evidence suggest any malicious intent or security issues.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments:\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n- Obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- Security risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.",
