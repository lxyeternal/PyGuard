  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Deezer API error handling",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read within this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; exception classes are only defined",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input to output; only class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception classes to represent various error conditions. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or data manipulations. No embedded or hidden malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve as a structured error handling framework, which is typical for API implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for API error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
