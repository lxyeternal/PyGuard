  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Deezer API errors. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no external data flows. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of exception classes for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
