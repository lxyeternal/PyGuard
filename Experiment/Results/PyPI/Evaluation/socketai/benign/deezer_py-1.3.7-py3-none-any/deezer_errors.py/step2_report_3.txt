  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Deezer API error handling.\n- No input/output, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign exception hierarchy.\n\n**Assessment of individual points:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n   - No discrepancies or missing classes are noted.\n   - The exception classes are properly structured, with inheritance and message attributes.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no errors or suspicious elements.\n   - The reasoning is sound: these are straightforward exception class definitions.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Confidence is 1, indicating certainty that the code is safe.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; all reports correctly state that the code is purely structural and safe.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The exception classes are typical for API error handling.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify that this code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The code is safe and poses no security threat.\n- The purpose is purely to define exception classes for error handling.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
