  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward wrapper for constructing command arguments for an external utility. The primary security consideration is ensuring that 'file_path' is sanitized before being used in command execution to prevent command injection. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The assigned scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) due to potential misuse if inputs are untrusted."
