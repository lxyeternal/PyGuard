  "purpose": "Wrapper class for the cwebp command-line tool to encode images into WebP format with specified parameters.",
  "sources": "File path input provided to get_command_arguments method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the constructed command; potential overwriting of input file if file_path is same for input and output.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> command arguments construction -> execution of cwebp with parameters -> output file (possibly same as input).",
  "anomalies": "Potential overwriting of input file due to same file_path used for input and output; no validation or error handling shown.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs command-line arguments for cwebp with reasonable parameters. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malware. The main operational concern is overwriting the input file without safeguards. No security flaws or malicious intent are apparent, and the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper around cwebp with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The empty reports do not indicate any vulnerabilities or malware. Minor operational risk exists due to potential file overwriting, but no security issues are present.",
