  "purpose": "Import local modules related to image optimization tools, likely for use within a package that handles image processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Local module imports from the same package directory: cwebp, gifsicle, jpegoptim, optipng, pngquant.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only imports modules and does not process data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code structures, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules, each associated with image optimization utilities. These imports are standard for package modularization and do not indicate malicious behavior. There are no data input points, no external network connections, and no unusual code constructs or potential backdoors. The code appears to be a simple module import block, typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving as an import mechanism for internal modules related to image processing. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks within this snippet.",
