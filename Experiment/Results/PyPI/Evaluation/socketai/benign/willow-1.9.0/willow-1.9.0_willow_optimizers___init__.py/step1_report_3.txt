  "purpose": "Import statements for various image optimization modules within a package",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules from the current package directory",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform output actions",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; only module imports are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements bringing in classes from sibling modules within the same package. No data input, processing, or external communication is present. The import statements include no dynamic execution, user input handling, or potentially malicious constructs. The modules imported appear to be related to image processing or optimization tools, which are standard in image handling workflows. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements for image optimization modules, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
