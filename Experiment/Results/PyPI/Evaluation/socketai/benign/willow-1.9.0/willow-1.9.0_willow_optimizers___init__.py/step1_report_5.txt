  "purpose": "Importing local modules related to image processing tools (cwebp, gifsicle, jpegoptim, optipng, pngquant) for use within the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory modules (cwebp, gifsicle, jpegoptim, optipng, pngquant). No external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified. No network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports of local modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The imports are standard for a package managing image utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules, each representing an image processing utility. There are no data manipulations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. The code appears to be standard module imports, with no indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a set of import statements for internal modules. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
