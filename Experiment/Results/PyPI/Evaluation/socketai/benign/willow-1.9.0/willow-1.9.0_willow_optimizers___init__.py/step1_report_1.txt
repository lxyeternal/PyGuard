{
  "purpose": "The code imports various image optimization or processing modules from the current package for use within the package or external modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from the current package (relative imports). No direct data input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation detected. The imports are standard for package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for modules named Cwebp, Gifsicle, Jpegoptim, Optipng, and Pngquant, all imported relatively from the same package. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. These modules likely handle image processing tasks. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling are evident. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of import statements for image processing modules, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears to be a normal part of a larger image optimization package.",
