  "purpose": "Import statements for various image optimization modules within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink is evident in these import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. The import statements are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, each representing different image processing tools. There are no data manipulations, network operations, or embedded code that could indicate malicious behavior. The presence of 'noqa: F401' comments suggests the imports are for type checking or optional usage, not active code execution. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard part of a larger package intended for image processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple set of import statements for local modules related to image processing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in these lines.",
