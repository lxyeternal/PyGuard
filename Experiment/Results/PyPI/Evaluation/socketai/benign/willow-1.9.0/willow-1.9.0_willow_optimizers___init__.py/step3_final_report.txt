{
  "purpose": "This code imports local modules related to image processing, likely for optional or type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements from modules: cwebp, gifsicle, jpegoptim, optipng, pngquant.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; import statements do not process untrusted input or produce output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static relative import statements for modules associated with image optimization. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The presence of '# noqa: F401' suggests these imports may be for optional dependencies or type hints, not necessarily used at runtime. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import block for image processing modules with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
