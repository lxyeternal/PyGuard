  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of straightforward import statements for local modules related to image processing. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious patterns. The import statements are standard and include no unusual constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The code appears correct and typical for a Python package structure. The use of `# noqa: F401` suggests that some imports might be unused in certain contexts, which is common in package code to avoid linter warnings. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statements.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks, elevating the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code snippet is a typical import block in a Python package for image processing modules.\n- No evidence suggests any supply chain attack or malicious intent.\n- The use of `# noqa: F401` is standard for optional imports or to suppress linter warnings about unused imports.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate and justified. No further adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, and the risk is minimal.",
