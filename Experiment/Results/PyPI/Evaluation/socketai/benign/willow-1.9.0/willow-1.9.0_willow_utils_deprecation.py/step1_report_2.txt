  "purpose": "Define a custom warning class for deprecated features, specifically related to the 'Willow17' version.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; the code defines a class only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely defines a class without any execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The class name suggests a deprecation warning for a specific version, but this is standard practice; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a class inheriting from DeprecationWarning, which is a standard way to define custom warning types in Python. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic that could be malicious. The naming convention indicates a version-specific warning, typical in maintaining backwards compatibility or signaling deprecation. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of a custom warning class for deprecation notices. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
