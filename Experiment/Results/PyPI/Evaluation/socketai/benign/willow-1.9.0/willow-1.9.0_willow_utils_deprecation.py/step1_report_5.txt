  "purpose": "Define a custom warning class for deprecated features in the codebase.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple class definition with no unusual patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class named 'RemovedInWillow17Warning' that inherits from DeprecationWarning. It is likely used to mark deprecation notices for features removed in a future version. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python class syntax.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard pattern for creating custom warnings in Python. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
