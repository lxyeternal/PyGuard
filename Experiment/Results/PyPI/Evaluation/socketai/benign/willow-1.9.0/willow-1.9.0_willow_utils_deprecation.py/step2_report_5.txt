  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from `DeprecationWarning`.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n   - No dynamic behavior, input handling, or external interactions are present.\n   - The class name suggests a version-specific deprecation warning, which is standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no issues or malicious elements.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition with no suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are sound and do not contain errors or flawed reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - Given the benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n   - The `confidence` is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n   - No score adjustments needed; the current scores align well with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and there's no evidence of malicious activity, the overall risk score should remain very low.\n   - The current `securityRisk` of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or external calls.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are based on factual, static analysis.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior or future use are made.\n   - The assessments are conservative and accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom deprecation warning. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk involved. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
