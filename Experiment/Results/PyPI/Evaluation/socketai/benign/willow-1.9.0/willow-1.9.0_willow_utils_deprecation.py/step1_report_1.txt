  "purpose": "Define a custom deprecation warning class named RemovedInWillow17Warning.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or sensitive information processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this minimal class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code simply defines a subclass of DeprecationWarning with no additional logic, parameters, or dynamic behavior; no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom warning class inheriting from DeprecationWarning, likely used elsewhere in a larger project for signaling deprecated features. It contains no data input, no data processing, and no external calls or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The class is straightforward and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition intended for deprecation warning purposes. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
