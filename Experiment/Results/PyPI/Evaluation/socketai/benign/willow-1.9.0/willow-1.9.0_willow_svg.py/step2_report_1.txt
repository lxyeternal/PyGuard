  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Clear SVG parsing, manipulation, and output, with no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses regex per SVG specs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is well-structured, handles validation, and does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The malware score is zero, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar SVG handling, parsing attributes, and writing output.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SVG processing with no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Parsing, manipulating, and outputting SVGs.\n- **Anomalies:** No credentials, network, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SVG handling, safe operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores reflect safe code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** SVG parsing, transformations, output.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SVG processing, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with a safe SVG library.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** SVG attribute parsing and manipulation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SVG handling code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and given the code's nature—parsing and manipulating SVG files—there's no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. The code is static and adheres to SVG standards.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear, readable, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, which is low. The only minor concern could be if malformed SVGs could cause issues, but the code validates input carefully.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Security Risk Score:** 0.1 (a small buffer for potential parsing issues, but overall very safe)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a well-implemented SVG handling library with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low scores reflect the safe and standard nature of the code.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed. The current scores are appropriate.",
