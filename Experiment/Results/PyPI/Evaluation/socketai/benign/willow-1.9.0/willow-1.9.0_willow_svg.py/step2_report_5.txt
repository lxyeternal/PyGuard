  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a well-structured SVG parsing and manipulation library.\n- They highlight standard parsing of SVG attributes, safe handling of viewBox, size, and aspect ratio, and operations like crop and resize.\n- No suspicious code patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are mentioned.\n- All reports assign very low malware and security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1–0.2).\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9–0.95), indicating consistent assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness & presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are explicitly identified. The code appears to follow SVG specifications, with proper validation and exception handling.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Input validation:** Adequate regex validation for SVG attributes, sizes, and viewBox parsing.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only possible concern could be malformed SVG input, but the code handles parsing errors explicitly, reducing risk.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the code or the reasoning in reports.\n- The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, given the code's focus on SVG parsing and manipulation without external system or network access.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is primarily SVG parsing and manipulation, which by itself is not malicious.\n- No signs of dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- The use of regex for parsing is standard and safe here.\n- The code does not handle any sensitive data or credentials.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The current scores are reasonable and align with the detailed assessments.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores reflect the low risk and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\nBased on all reports and the detailed review, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal risk, mainly related to SVG parsing correctness, not security)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no security or malware concerns.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate SVG processing library with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing report scores are appropriate and justified.",
