{
  "purpose": "The code provides SVG parsing, validation, manipulation, and rendering functionalities, including size conversions, viewBox handling, and transformations, aimed at SVG image processing.",
  "sources": "SVG DOM attributes such as 'width', 'height', 'viewBox', and 'preserveAspectRatio'; input files for SVG data.",
  "sinks": "Writing modified SVG data back to files or streams, setting SVG element attributes.",
  "flows": "Input SVG attributes → parsing and validation → internal data structures → attribute modifications → output SVG serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Regex used for parsing is standard and compliant with SVG specs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SVG parsing and manipulation with proper validation and exception handling. It uses regex for parsing attributes like viewBox and preserveAspectRatio, and converts sizes with well-defined methods. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The code adheres to SVG specifications and does not include any malicious logic or obfuscation. Input validation appears robust, and the code's operations are read-only or attribute modifications, typical for SVG processing libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-implemented SVG handling library with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the code's benign nature.",
