{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for handling, parsing, and manipulating SVG images, including viewBox parsing, scaling, and cropping.",
  "sources": "Reads SVG element attributes such as viewBox, width, height, and preserveAspectRatio; reads input from SVG files via SvgImageFile; processes user-defined rect parameters for cropping.",
  "sinks": "Sets SVG attributes like viewBox, width, height; writes SVG data to files; converts SVG files to image objects.",
  "flows": "Input SVG file -> parse attributes (viewBox, size, preserveAspectRatio) -> manipulate SVG elements and attributes -> write modified SVG to file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation observed. The code uses regexes for parsing but in a standard way. No suspicious network or system calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically parses and manipulates SVG data, including scaling and cropping. It relies on regex for parsing viewBox and size attributes, which are standard practices. No input/output operations suggest external or untrusted data flows beyond reading and writing files. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, credential theft, or system compromise, is present. The code appears to be a legitimate SVG processing library with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SVG handling library with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It primarily performs parsing, scaling, and attribute modifications on SVG elements. No evidence of malware or malicious activity found.",
