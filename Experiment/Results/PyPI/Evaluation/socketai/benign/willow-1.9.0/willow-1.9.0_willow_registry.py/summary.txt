  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent plugin registry system for image processing with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects potential misuse if malicious plugins are registered, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0, indicating a safe and clear implementation."
