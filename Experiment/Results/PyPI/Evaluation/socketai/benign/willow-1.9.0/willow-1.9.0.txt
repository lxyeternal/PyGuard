      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent plugin registry system for image processing with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects potential misuse if malicious plugins are registered, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0, indicating a safe and clear implementation."

      "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent and justified. The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which justify moderate malware and risk scores. No definitive malicious behavior is confirmed. Continued monitoring and further detailed code review are recommended to clarify suspicions."

The primary security consideration is ensuring that 'file_path' is sanitized before being used in command execution to prevent command injection. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The assigned scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) due to potential misuse if inputs are untrusted."
