{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'types-singledispatch' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Constants and function calls providing package metadata, string literals, URLs, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is straightforward package setup without untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static package metadata, descriptions, URLs, dependencies, and package data. All inputs are hardcoded and from trusted sources. No runtime input, external data processing, or network activity is present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and contains no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical configuration for publishing a Python package, with all data hardcoded and no external data handling.",
