  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools with static metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for package name, description, URLs, package data, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – static data assigned to setup() parameters without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, user input, network activity, obfuscation, or secrets; all data is static and from reputable sources.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module, with all data hardcoded and no dynamic or external data processing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The URLs point to legitimate repositories, and the package data is standard. The code adheres to common packaging practices and contains no suspicious constructs or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All indicators confirm its legitimacy, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
