{
  "purpose": "This code sets up and configures a Python package named 'types-singledispatch' for distribution via PyPI, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data for package metadata, dependencies, and URLs; no external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The setup function consumes the static variables and parameters, which are predefined; there are no untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and uses it to define package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration options. All data is hardcoded, static, and intended for package distribution. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data inputs, or suspicious code patterns. The structure follows typical Python package setup conventions. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, contains no obfuscated or suspicious code, and functions solely to define package metadata for distribution.",
