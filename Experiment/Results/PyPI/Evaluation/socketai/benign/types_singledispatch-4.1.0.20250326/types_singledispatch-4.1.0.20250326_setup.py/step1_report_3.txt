{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the 'types-singledispatch' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools; variables containing package metadata; setup() function call with arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources; the setup() function parameters do not process external or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, setting variables with static strings, and calling setup() with static arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines package metadata through variables. It then calls setup() with static parameters, including URLs, package data, and classifiers. All data appears to be hardcoded and sourced from trusted, open-source repositories. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It is a straightforward configuration with static, trusted data.",
