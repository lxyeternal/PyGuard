{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'types-singledispatch' Python package, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "All data is hardcoded within the script: package metadata, URL links, dependencies, package data, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as all data is statically defined and there are no dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The script is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with statically defined package metadata, data, and configuration parameters. There are no dynamic inputs, no network calls, or executable code that could be malicious. All URLs and data points are standard for package configuration, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
