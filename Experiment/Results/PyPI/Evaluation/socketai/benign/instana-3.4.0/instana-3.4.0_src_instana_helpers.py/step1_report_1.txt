{
  "purpose": "The code defines two deprecated functions intended to generate EUM snippets, likely for monitoring or telemetry purposes within an application.",
  "sources": "The code imports environment variables (`os`), configuration variables (`instana.eum_api_key`), and module attributes (`tracer`, `logger`). No explicit input sources are present within the functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions return static strings and do not perform any data output or external communications. There are no evident sinks related to data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the functions simply return empty strings, with no processing of external or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The functions are simple stubs marked as deprecated, returning empty strings. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, comments, and two deprecated functions that return empty strings. There are no active data flows, no use of environment variables or untrusted inputs within these functions, and no suspicious operations. The imported modules such as `os`, `string.Template`, and specific modules from `instana` do not exhibit malicious behavior here. Overall, the code appears to be benign, serving as placeholders or deprecated utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, contains no malicious code, and does not pose security risks. It appears to be a deprecated utility module with no active operations or data handling. The overall security risk score is very low.",
