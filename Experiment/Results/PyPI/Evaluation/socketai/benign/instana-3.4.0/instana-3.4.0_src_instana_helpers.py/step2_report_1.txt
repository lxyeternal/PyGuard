  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code consists of two deprecated functions (`eum_snippet` and `eum_test_snippet`) that simply return empty strings.\n- The functions import modules and variables that could be used for malicious purposes (e.g., `os`, `instana.eum_api_key`, `tracer`, `logger`), but none are utilized in the current implementation.\n- The code appears to be placeholder or legacy code, with no active data processing, network activity, or external communication.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. The reports claim benign, deprecated placeholder functions with no active behavior, which aligns with the code.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  Not in terms of security. The code is minimal and appears intentionally inert.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting negligible security risk. This is reasonable given the code's inert state.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is deprecated and non-functional, serving as placeholders.\n- Importing modules like `os`, `string.Template`, and variables like `instana.eum_api_key` could be suspicious if active, but since they are unused, they pose no risk.\n- No data flows, no external calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The presence of unused imports and variables might suggest incomplete or legacy code, but not malicious intent.\n- The code's deprecated status indicates it is no longer in active use, further reducing risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, mainly due to the deprecated, unused nature)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, deprecated, and inert. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the benign, placeholder nature of the code, with minimal security concern.",
