{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility functions related to EUM (End User Monitoring) snippets for Instana, a monitoring tool, primarily returning empty strings. It may have been used for embedding or generating monitoring scripts or data.",
  "sources": "The code imports environment variables (`os`), global variables (`global_eum_api_key`), and modules (`tracer`, `logger`) that could potentially be used to access external or sensitive data, but in the current code, these are not actively utilized.",
  "sinks": "No active sinks are present. The functions return static empty strings without processing or outputting any data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since the functions simply return empty strings and do not process input or output data.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are deprecated and do not perform any operations, which is unusual for utility functions. The import of potentially sensitive modules or variables without their use might be a sign of incomplete or placeholder code. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and variables that could potentially be used for malicious purposes if extended or misused (e.g., `os`, `global_eum_api_key`, `tracer`, `logger`), but in its current form, the functions are inert and return empty strings. The presence of deprecated functions suggests this code is outdated or placeholder, not actively malicious. No data flows, external connections, or sensitive data handling are present. The code does not perform any harmful actions, and there are no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, deprecated placeholder for EUM snippet generation functions. It currently does nothing and does not exhibit malicious behavior. No security risks or malware are present.",
