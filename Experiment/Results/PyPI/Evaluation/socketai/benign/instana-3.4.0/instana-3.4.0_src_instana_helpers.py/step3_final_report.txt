{
  "purpose": "Placeholder deprecated functions returning empty strings, serving as legacy or inert code with no active behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports of os, string.Template, instana.eum_api_key, tracer, logger; no data input or external data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; functions do not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; functions return static strings without processing inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports and variables suggest legacy or incomplete code, but no malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two deprecated functions that return empty strings, with imports that could be used maliciously if extended but are currently unused. No data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior is present. The code is inert and serves as a placeholder, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given its deprecated, inert state.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, deprecated, and inert, posing no security threat. The current scores are justified and should remain low. No further action needed.",
