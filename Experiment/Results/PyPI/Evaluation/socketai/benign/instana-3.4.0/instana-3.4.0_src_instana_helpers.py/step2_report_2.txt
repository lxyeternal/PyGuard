  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists of two deprecated functions (`eum_snippet` and `eum_test_snippet`) that simply return empty strings.\n- The code imports modules (`os`, `string.Template`, and some from `instana`) and variables (`instana.eum_api_key`, `tracer`, `logger`) but does not utilize them actively.\n- No data processing, external communication, or use of untrusted inputs occurs.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious code is present.\n- The functions are clearly marked as deprecated, indicating they are legacy or placeholder code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The report states that the functions are inert, returning empty strings, which matches the code.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears straightforward, with no evident bugs or security flaws.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting the deprecated and inactive status.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  **None.** All reports indicate no active behavior, so high risk scores are unjustified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is present, malware should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports are cautious, noting that while the code imports potentially sensitive modules, it does not use them maliciously. This is appropriate.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores across reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is inert, deprecated, and serves as a placeholder.\n- No active data flow, no external communication, no use of untrusted inputs.\n- The presence of imported modules and variables not used does not imply malicious intent; it might be legacy or incomplete code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (low, due to deprecated status and potential for future misuse if extended, but currently inert)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security issues.**",
