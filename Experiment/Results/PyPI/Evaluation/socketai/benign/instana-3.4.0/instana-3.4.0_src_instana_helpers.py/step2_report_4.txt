  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code contains two functions, `eum_snippet` and `eum_test_snippet`, both marked as deprecated.\n- Both functions simply return empty strings.\n- The code imports modules such as `os`, `string.Template`, and some `instana` modules, including environment variables and loggers.\n- No data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity is evident.\n- The functions are placeholders, likely remnants of previous implementations.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n#### 1. **Are the reported issues present in the code?**\n- The reports mainly describe the functions as deprecated placeholders returning empty strings, with no active logic or data flow.\n- The code matches this description.\n- **Confirmed:** No active security issues or malicious behavior are present.\n\n#### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**\n- The reports consistently note that the functions are inert and return empty strings.\n- They mention the imports and potential for misuse if extended but correctly conclude that, in current form, the code is benign.\n- No significant errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reports.\n\n#### 3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1).\n- Given the code's nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n- **No changes needed** here.\n\n#### 4. **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**\n- The code does not perform any active operations, does not process untrusted input, and returns static strings.\n- The only concern might be the imported modules that could be misused if extended, but currently, they are unused.\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified** based on current code behavior.\n\n#### 5. **Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Confirmed:** malware score is appropriate.\n\n#### 6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- Some reports mention potential misuse or that the imported modules could be used maliciously.\n- These are speculative; the current code does not execute or process data, so such claims are not justified.\n- **No active vulnerabilities or malicious intent** are demonstrated.\n\n#### 7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores align with the benign, placeholder nature of the code.\n- No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall security risk:**  \nThe code is a deprecated, inert placeholder with no active logic or data flow. It does not pose security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential for future misuse if extended, but currently negligible)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The presence of deprecated functions and unused imports suggests legacy or placeholder code, not malicious.\n- No active vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The current scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain low. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the low scores; consider marking the code as non-risky with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to its deprecated, inert nature.",
