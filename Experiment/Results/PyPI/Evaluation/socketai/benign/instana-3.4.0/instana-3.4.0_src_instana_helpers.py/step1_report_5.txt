{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be utility functions related to generating EUM (End User Monitoring) snippets for Instana, mainly returning empty strings as deprecated functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for environment variables, modules, and functions; no direct data input or external data sources used within functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output static empty strings; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; functions do not process or transform any data, always return empty strings.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated functions that do not perform any operation; imported variables like 'global_eum_api_key' are not used, which might indicate incomplete or placeholder code. No security-sensitive operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variables and modules, defines two deprecated functions that return empty strings, and includes comments. No data processing, no external communication, no use of user input or environment variables within functions. The code structure and content suggest it is either placeholder or legacy code with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It appears to be deprecated placeholder functions with no active logic. No malware or security threats detected.",
