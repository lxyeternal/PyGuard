  "purpose": "This code provides deprecated functions for generating EUM (End User Monitoring) snippets, likely for embedding monitoring scripts or data.",
  "sources": "Imports os, string.Template, instana.eum_api_key, tracer, logger; functions parameters (trace_id, eum_api_key, meta)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the functions return static strings without processing untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions return empty strings without processing input parameters",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs detected; functions are placeholders returning empty strings",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules but does not perform any data processing or network operations. The functions are deprecated and only return empty strings, indicating no active behavior. No use of untrusted input or external data. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as placeholder functions for deprecated features, and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
