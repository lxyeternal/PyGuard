{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility module related to IBM and Instana for generating EUM snippets, likely for monitoring or telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (import os) and imports API keys and loggers from other modules. No explicit input handling or data input sources are present within these functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions return empty strings and do not process or output untrusted data. No direct sinks for untrusted data are identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks because the functions return static strings without processing input data.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are marked as deprecated and contain no implementation, returning only empty strings. There are no suspicious or unusual behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or code execution activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports some modules and defines two deprecated functions that return empty strings. There are no input handling, no data processing, and no output operations. The imports and function definitions are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of actual implementation suggests that the module is currently inactive or placeholder code. No anomalous behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of placeholder functions with no active logic or data processing. It does not contain malware or security risks. The primary concern might be the deprecated status, but this is not inherently malicious.",
