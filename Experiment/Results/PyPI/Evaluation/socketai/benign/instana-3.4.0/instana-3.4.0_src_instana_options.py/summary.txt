  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration management module for the Instana agent. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical configuration handling. The scores should be set with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting environment variable influence, which is standard practice."
