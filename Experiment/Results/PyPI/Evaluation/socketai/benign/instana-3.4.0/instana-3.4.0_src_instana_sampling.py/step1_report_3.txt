{
  "purpose": "Define sampling policies and an abstract base class for tracers, with a specific implementation for Instana.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are explicitly read; the code defines classes and enum.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations, network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; methods simply return fixed boolean values based on internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The class is straightforward and intended for tracing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and abstract classes for sampling policies in a tracing system, with a specific sampler that always returns False for sampling, indicating no tracing. There are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors. No malicious intent or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a tracing sampler with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected. It appears to be part of a legitimate tracing setup, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
