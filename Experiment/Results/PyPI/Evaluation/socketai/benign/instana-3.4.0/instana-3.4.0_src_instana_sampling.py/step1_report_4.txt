  "purpose": "Defines sampling policies and a sampler class for tracing systems, specifically an Instana sampler that never samples.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or external data handling points.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows involving untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure and logic are straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes enum-based sampling policies and a class implementing a sampler that always drops traces. It does not handle external data, secrets, or perform network operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of sampling policies and a static sampler class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
