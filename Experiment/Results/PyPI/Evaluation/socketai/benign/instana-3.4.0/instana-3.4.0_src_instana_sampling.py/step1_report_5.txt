{
  "purpose": "Defines sampling policies and an abstract sampler class with a specific implementation that always drops spans.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code primarily defines classes and enums without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The InstanaSampler class always returns False for sampling, which could be a deliberate design choice but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an enumeration for sampling policies and defines an abstract base class for samplers. The InstanaSampler implementation always returns False for the sampled() method, indicating it never samples spans. No external data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing is present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for a tracing system with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration component for a tracing system with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The always-drop behavior in InstanaSampler might be intentional for specific use cases but does not indicate malicious intent.",
