{
  "purpose": "Define sampling policies and a sampler class for tracing systems, specifically implementing an Instana sampler that never samples.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the class initializes a fixed sampling policy without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation of enums and abstract classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for sampling policies, an abstract base class for samplers, and a specific implementation for Instana that always returns False for sampling. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data handling, and no suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard, intended for use in tracing systems, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard sampling policy definitions and a fixed sampler class with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
