{
  "purpose": "Defines sampling policies and an abstract base class for samplers used in tracing systems, with a specific implementation that never samples.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumeration for sampling policies and an abstract class for samplers with a concrete implementation (InstanaSampler) that always returns False for sampled(), indicating no sampling. There are no inputs, external data handling, or potentially malicious code segments. The code appears to be standard, intended for configuring tracing behavior, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of tracing sampler policies without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. It is benign.",
