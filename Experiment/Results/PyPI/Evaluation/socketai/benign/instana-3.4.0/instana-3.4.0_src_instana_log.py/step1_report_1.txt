{
  "purpose": "Configure and provide different loggers based on environment conditions such as running inside gunicorn, AWS Lambda, or standard environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'AWS_EXECUTION_ENV', sys.argv, contents of '/proc/self/cmdline' file",
  "sinks": "Logger outputs via logging handlers",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line arguments influence logger configuration, which then outputs logs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging configurations based on environment detection. It reads environment variables and command-line arguments to decide whether to use a standard logger, an AWS Lambda logger, or a gunicorn error logger. It includes functions to check for the presence of the 'glogging' package and whether the process runs inside gunicorn by inspecting sys.argv and the '/proc/self/cmdline' file. No data leaks, credential theft, or malicious network activities are present. The code appears to be straightforward environment detection and logger setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment-aware logger setup without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
