{
  "purpose": "Configure and select appropriate loggers based on the environment, such as standard, AWS Lambda, or Gunicorn.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ.get), sys.argv, /proc/self/cmdline, imported modules (logging, os, sys).",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers and formatters, which output log messages; no direct data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Environment detection (AWS Lambda or Gunicorn) influences logger selection and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; environment detection is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up logging based on environment conditions. It checks for Gunicorn via sys.argv or /proc/self/cmdline and sets a logger accordingly. It also detects if running in AWS Lambda via environment variables. The code handles exceptions gracefully and does not perform any unsafe or malicious operations. No suspicious data flows, external network activity, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on environment-based logger configuration without any malicious intent or security risks. It is standard environment detection and logging setup code.",
