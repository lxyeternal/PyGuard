  "purpose": "Environment detection for logger setup and environment-specific configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AWS_EXECUTION_ENV), sys.argv, /proc/self/cmdline file",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network or file exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line args influence logger selection; no data flows leading to malicious actions",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment detection and logger configuration",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment detection by checking environment variables, command-line arguments, and process info files. It configures loggers accordingly without any suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. Exception handling is appropriate, and no hardcoded secrets or network activity is present. The logic is simple, transparent, and aligns with common practices for environment-aware logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing environment detection and logger configuration without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and justified given the code's straightforward nature.",
