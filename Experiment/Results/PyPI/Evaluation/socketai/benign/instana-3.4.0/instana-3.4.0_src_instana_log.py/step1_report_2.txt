  "purpose": "Configure logging for different environments such as standard, AWS Lambda, and Gunicorn.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AWS_EXECUTION_ENV), sys.argv, /proc/self/cmdline file, import statements, and functions that check environment and process details.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers and loggers that output to console or other logging systems.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and process checks influence logger configuration, which then outputs logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard environment checks and logging setup. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging based on runtime environment, including checking for AWS Lambda and Gunicorn. It reads environment variables (AWS_EXECUTION_ENV) and inspects sys.argv or /proc/self/cmdline to determine if running under Gunicorn. These are typical environment detection techniques. The logger configuration uses standard Python logging, with no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All functions and conditional logic are straightforward and intended for environment detection and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detection and logging configuration script with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
