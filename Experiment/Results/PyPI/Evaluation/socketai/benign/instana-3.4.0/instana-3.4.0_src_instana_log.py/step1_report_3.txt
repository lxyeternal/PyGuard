{
  "purpose": "This code sets up logging configurations and environment detection for different deployment scenarios such as local, Gunicorn, and AWS Lambda environments.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (AWS_EXECUTION_ENV), command-line arguments (sys.argv), and file contents (/proc/self/cmdline).",
  "sinks": "Uses logging functions to output logs, potentially to system consoles or log files.",
  "flows": "Environment detection flows from environment variables and command-line arguments, which influence logger configuration and selection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious network activity; logic is straightforward environment detection and logger setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment detection for AWS Lambda and Gunicorn and sets up appropriate loggers accordingly. It reads environment variables, command-line arguments, and process info from the filesystem to determine the environment. It then configures loggers but does not perform any network communication, data collection, or data exfiltration. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are present. The use of environment checks and logger configuration is typical for deployment-aware applications, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment detection and logging setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions as intended for logging purposes across different deployment platforms.",
