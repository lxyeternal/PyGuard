  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward environment detection and singleton initialization module for a monitoring SDK. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the low-risk nature of environment detection logic."
