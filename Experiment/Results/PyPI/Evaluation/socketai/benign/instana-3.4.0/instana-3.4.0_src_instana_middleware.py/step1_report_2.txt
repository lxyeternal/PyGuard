  "purpose": "The code imports middleware components for ASGI and WSGI from the Instana instrumentation library, likely to integrate monitoring or tracing features into a web application.",
  "sources": "Imports from instana.instrumentation.asgi and instana.instrumentation.wsgi modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow or source-to-sink paths evident",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements with no additional logic; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific middleware components for application performance monitoring from the Instana library. There are no data inputs, processing, or network interactions present. The code is minimal and straightforward, indicating intended monitoring setup rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving to import monitoring middleware without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
