  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not create data flows with untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The import statements are straightforward and standard for instrumentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific middleware classes for ASGI and WSGI applications, which are typical for monitoring tools like Instana. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or malicious patterns present. The copyright comments do not influence security analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements used for application instrumentation. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are evident.",
