{
  "purpose": "The code imports middleware components from the 'instana' monitoring library, likely for application performance monitoring and tracing in ASGI and WSGI Python web frameworks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'instana.instrumentation.asgi' and 'instana.instrumentation.wsgi'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output is observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and does not execute any data flows",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only import statements and no additional logic; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for middleware components used in application monitoring. These are standard imports with no dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. There is no evidence of data input, output, or control flow that could lead to security issues or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, limited to importing monitoring middleware for application performance tracking. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
