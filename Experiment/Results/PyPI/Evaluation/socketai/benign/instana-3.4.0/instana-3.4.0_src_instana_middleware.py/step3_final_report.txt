  "purpose": "Import monitoring middleware components from the 'instana' library for ASGI and WSGI frameworks.",
  "sources": "Static import statements for InstanaASGIMiddleware and InstanaWSGIMiddleware modules.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of data processing, execution, or suspicious patterns; straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing monitoring middleware modules. There is no execution logic, data handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The import statements are standard for application instrumentation and do not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and purpose as setup for monitoring confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely import statements for application monitoring middleware, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
