  "purpose": "Importing middleware components from the Instana instrumentation library for ASGI and WSGI frameworks, likely for monitoring or tracing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'instana.instrumentation.asgi' and 'instana.instrumentation.wsgi'",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths observed",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements; no code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for middleware modules from the Instana library. These modules are used for application performance monitoring and do not by themselves introduce security risks. No input reading, data processing, or external communication occurs in this snippet. The license comments are standard copyright notices. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to import monitoring middleware modules. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
