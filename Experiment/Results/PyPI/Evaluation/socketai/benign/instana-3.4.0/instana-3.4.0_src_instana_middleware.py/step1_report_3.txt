  "purpose": "Importing middleware components from the instana.instrumentation library for application performance monitoring and tracing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from instana.instrumentation modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only import statements with no runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected. The imports are standard for monitoring tools.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements for monitoring middlewares from the instana library. These are used for application tracing and performance monitoring, not for malicious activity. No input sources, data sinks, or untrusted data flows are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for integration setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import monitoring middleware components without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
