  "purpose": "Importing and aliasing a WSGI middleware class from a local instrumentation package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module path for the middleware class, and references to the imported class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and aliasing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and aliasing statements with copyright comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of copyright comments, an import statement for a middleware class, and an alias assignment. There are no dynamic or user input, no external data reads, no code execution, and no suspicious patterns. It appears to be a straightforward module import and aliasing with no malicious or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple import and alias assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
