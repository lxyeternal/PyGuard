  "purpose": "Import and aliasing of WSGI middleware for instrumentation",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.instrumentation.wsgi)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module import and aliasing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code contains only copyright comments, an import statement, and an alias assignment. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious or suspicious logic present. The import is from a local package, likely used for instrumentation purposes. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving as a simple import and alias for a middleware component. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
