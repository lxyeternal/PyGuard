  "purpose": "Import and alias a WSGI middleware class for instrumentation or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the local module '.instrumentation.wsgi'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Import of the class followed by assignment to an alias; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and aliasing statement with no data processing, dynamic execution, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very close) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent. The minimal security risk score in one report (0.1) is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for full consistency. Confidence in the benign assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
