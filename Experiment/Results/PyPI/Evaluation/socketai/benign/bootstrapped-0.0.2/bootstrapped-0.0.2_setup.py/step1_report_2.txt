  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bootstrapped' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file; no other data sources or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of setuptools with standard fields.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for long description, then calls setup() with package info and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, nor suspicious behaviors are evident. Usage of standard setup.py patterns indicates typical package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears to be a normal package configuration script.",
