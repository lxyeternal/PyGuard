  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bootstrapped' Python package, used to specify package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.rst' file to obtain long description data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data effects are present.",
  "flows": "The content flows from reading a file ('README.rst') to setting up package parameters; no untrusted data flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It reads the README file for description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URL. All operations are standard for Python package setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script for package distribution, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
