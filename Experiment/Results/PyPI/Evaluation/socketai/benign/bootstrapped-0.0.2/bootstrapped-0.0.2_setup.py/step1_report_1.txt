  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'bootstrapped', specifying its metadata, dependencies, and repository URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.rst file for the long description; it uses hardcoded strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or untrusted output are present; no network communication or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input source: reading 'README.rst'; no data flows to external sinks; setup configurations are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns, is present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools, reads a static README file, and specifies dependencies and metadata. There are no dynamic or suspicious operations, no handling of untrusted input, and no malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and follows standard practices.",
