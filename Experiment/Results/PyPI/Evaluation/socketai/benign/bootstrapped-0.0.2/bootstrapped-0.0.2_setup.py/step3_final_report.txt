  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing a library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static package metadata, dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static data read from file and passed directly to setup(); no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, obfuscated patterns, or malicious behavior. It reads a static README file and calls setup() with fixed metadata and dependencies. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or suspicious operations are present. All dependencies are common packages, and there are no external data sources or sinks. The code structure is simple and standard, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The security and malware scores are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard packaging script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code content.",
