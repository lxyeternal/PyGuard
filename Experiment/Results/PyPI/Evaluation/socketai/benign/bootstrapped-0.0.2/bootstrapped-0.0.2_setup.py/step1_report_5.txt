  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'bootstrapped' Python module, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads static file for description; dependencies are specified statically; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URL. No user input, environment variables, or external data influencing behavior is present. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activities detected. The dependencies are standard packages, and the code structure is typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
