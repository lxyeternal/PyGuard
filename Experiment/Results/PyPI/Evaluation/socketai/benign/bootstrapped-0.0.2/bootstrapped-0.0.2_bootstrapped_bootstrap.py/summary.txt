  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of bootstrap statistical methods with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score should be very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to multiprocessing and randomness but no malicious behavior."
