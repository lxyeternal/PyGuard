{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for bootstrap statistical analysis, including confidence interval estimation and A/B testing, primarily for data analysis in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input arrays (numpy.ndarray or scipy.sparse.csr_matrix), random number generation for bootstrap sampling, and optional seed setting.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data leakage, system compromise, or external communication are present. No network or system modification code detected.",
  "flows": "Data is sourced from input arrays; bootstrap sampling and statistical functions operate on these inputs; results are computed and returned as BootstrapResults objects or numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. Usage of standard libraries (numpy, scipy, multiprocessing) is appropriate for the context. No obfuscation, malicious code injections, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs bootstrap resampling and confidence interval calculation for statistical estimates, including A/B testing. It utilizes numpy and scipy for data handling, with optional multiprocessing for parallel processing. The functions validate input data types and shapes, generate bootstrap distributions, and compute confidence intervals using percentile or pivotal methods. No suspicious network activity, code injections, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be well-structured and intended solely for statistical analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of bootstrap statistical methods for data analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It relies solely on open-source numerical libraries and performs legitimate statistical computations. Therefore, the code is deemed safe with a low malware and security risk score.",
