{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for creating bootstrap confidence intervals for statistical analysis, supporting both sparse and dense data, with multiprocessing capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays or scipy sparse matrices; uses numpy's random functions for sampling.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications; computations are internal and local.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through bootstrap sampling functions, with results processed locally without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of multiprocessing and random seed setting are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard bootstrap resampling techniques with support for sparse matrices and parallel processing. It relies solely on open-source libraries like numpy and scipy, with no external network or system interactions. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The use of multiprocessing and random seed setting are typical in statistical computations and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of bootstrap statistical methods with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score should be very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to multiprocessing and randomness but no malicious behavior.",
