{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for bootstrap statistical analysis, including confidence interval estimation and A/B test comparison, primarily for numerical data in numpy arrays or sparse matrices.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from numpy arrays or sparse matrices, and also generates random samples using numpy's random functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be leaked if outputs or exceptions contain internal data; however, no explicit data exfiltration or network communication is present. Random number generation is used for resampling.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through bootstrap resampling functions, which generate bootstrap distributions and compute confidence intervals; no external data flows or network communication are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are detected. All imported modules serve standard scientific computing purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious variable names. Random seed setting is standard for reproducibility. The code structure is typical for statistical bootstrap routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements bootstrap procedures with careful validation of input types and shapes. It supports both dense and sparse data, and uses multiprocessing for performance optimization. Random sampling is handled with numpy's functions. The methods are well-documented and align with standard bootstrap practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. The only sensitive operation is the use of numpy's random seed and sampling, which is typical for bootstrap methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of bootstrap statistical analysis functions with no indications of malicious intent. It is designed for statistical computations and does not perform any harmful operations. All functionalities seem legitimate and typical for a scientific Python library. No signs of sabotage or malware are detected.",
