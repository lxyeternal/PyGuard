{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute basic statistical measures (mean, sum, median, std) on matrices, supporting both sparse and dense formats.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data passed as 'values' parameters, which could originate from user input or data files, but no explicit data source or untrusted input handling is shown in this fragment.",
  "targets": "The code performs statistical calculations and returns numerical results; it does not include data sinks that send data to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through statistical functions and results are returned as arrays or numerical outputs. There are no flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard numerical processing with appropriate handling of sparse matrices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for statistical operations on matrices, supporting both sparse and dense formats. It includes type checks and uses numpy/scipy functions to perform calculations. No input sanitization or external data handling is shown, but the operations are straightforward. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present. The code is well-structured and focused solely on numerical computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of statistical functions for matrices, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for data analysis purposes.",
