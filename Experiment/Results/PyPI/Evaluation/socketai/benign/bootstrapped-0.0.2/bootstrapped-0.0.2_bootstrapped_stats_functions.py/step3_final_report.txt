{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical functions (mean, sum, median, std) for matrices and sparse matrices.",
  "sources": "Input matrices passed to functions (values parameter).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; functions return computed numerical results directly.",
  "flows": "Input matrices are processed within each function; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Minor docstring typo in median function ('Returns the sum of each row of a matrix' instead of median). No suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic statistical functions using numpy and scipy, handling both dense and sparse matrices with proper type checks. No malicious behavior, external data handling, or side effects are present. The functions are straightforward wrappers around numpy/scipy functions. The only minor issue is a documentation typo in the median function's docstring, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of statistical functions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The provided reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the safe nature of this code.",
