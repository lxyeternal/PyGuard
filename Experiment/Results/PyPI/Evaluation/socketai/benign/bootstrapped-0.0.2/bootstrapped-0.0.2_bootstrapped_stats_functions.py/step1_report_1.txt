{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for statistical analysis (mean, sum, median, std) on matrices or sparse matrices, likely for data analysis or comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the function parameters 'values', which can be numpy arrays, matrices, or sparse matrices.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output that could leak data or execute harmful actions; functions return numerical results without external effect.",
  "flows": "Input 'values' is processed through type checks and numpy/scipy functions; results are returned as arrays. There are no data flows leading to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The functions are straightforward mathematical computations with no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines four statistical functions that handle both dense and sparse matrices. Each function performs a simple computation (mean, sum, median, std) with appropriate handling of sparse matrix formats. There are no input sanitizations, no network calls, and no code that manipulates environment variables, files, or system resources. The code is clean, purpose-specific, and lacks obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of statistical functions for matrices and sparse matrices, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical operations safely and straightforwardly.",
