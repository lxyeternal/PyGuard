{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical functions (mean, sum, median, std) for matrices or sparse matrices, mainly for data analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through function parameters 'values'. No external data sources or user input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations and returns numerical results; no data leaks, network communication, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (values) is processed through mathematical functions and results are returned; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; functions are standard statistical calculations with appropriate handling of sparse matrices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common statistical functions using numpy and scipy, with checks for sparse matrix types. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no external network or system modifications are present. The code appears to be part of a data analysis library or module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware, and the code is straightforward and standard in its approach.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical statistical utility module with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
