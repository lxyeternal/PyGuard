{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical functions (mean, sum, median, std) for matrix or sparse matrix data, likely used for data analysis or comparison in bootstrap simulations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'values' parameter passed into each function, which can be numpy arrays, matrices, or sparse matrices.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or untrusted data outputs; functions perform internal calculations only.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into statistical functions, which process and return numerical summaries. There are no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward, utilizing standard numpy and scipy functions. No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or hidden operations are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several statistical functions operating on matrices or sparse matrices, with checks for data type and conversion. The functions use numpy and scipy for calculations, returning summary statistics. The code contains only data processing logic, with no input/output operations, external calls, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized access. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and utilizes common scientific computing libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for statistical data analysis. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs standard calculations safely using established libraries.",
