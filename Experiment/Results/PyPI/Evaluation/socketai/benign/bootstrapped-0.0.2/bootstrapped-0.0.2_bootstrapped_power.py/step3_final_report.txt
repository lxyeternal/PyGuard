  "purpose": "Functions for power analysis, generating dataframes, and plotting bootstrap results related to statistical power estimation.",
  "sources": "Input bootstrap result objects, data passed into functions (e.g., bootstrap_result_list).",
  "sinks": "Dataframes and plots generated internally; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Bootstrap result objects -> Dataframe creation -> Statistical calculations -> Plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical processing and visualization for bootstrap power analysis. It uses common libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) appropriately. No external data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions process input objects and generate summaries and plots without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent utility for bootstrap power analysis with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.1) in some reports is conservative; these could be lowered to 0.0 given the benign nature of the code.",
