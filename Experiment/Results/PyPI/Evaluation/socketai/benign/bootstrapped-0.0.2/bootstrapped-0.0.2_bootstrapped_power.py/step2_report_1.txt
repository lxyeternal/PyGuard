  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions for power analysis, generating dataframes, and plotting. Uses bootstrap result objects.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks; data flows within functions. \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard statistical analysis code, legitimate, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — Correct, no malware detected.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0 — Correct, code is clear.  \n- *Risk:* 0 — Appropriate, no security issues.\n\n**Confidence:** 0.95 — High confidence, given the straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions for power analysis, uses standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate data analysis code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — Correct.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0 — Correct.  \n- *Risk:* 0.1 — Slightly elevated, but justifiable as a conservative estimate; no actual vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Confidence:** 1.0 — Very high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same pattern as above, standard statistical plotting functions, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — Correct.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0 — Correct.  \n- *Risk:* 0 — Appropriate.\n\n**Confidence:** 1.0 — Very high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis; no external data leaks, no suspicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — Correct.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0 — Correct.  \n- *Risk:* 0 — Appropriate.\n\n**Confidence:** 0.9 — Slightly lower, but still high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion: legitimate statistical plotting code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — Correct.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0 — Correct.  \n- *Risk:* 0.1 — Slightly elevated but justified.\n\n**Confidence:** 1.0 — High.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code is straightforward, with no suspicious network, file, or data exfiltration activities.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, and the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1, which is conservative and acceptable given the lack of actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### **My Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is transparent and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.05** — Slightly above zero due to the possibility of future misuse, but no actual issues present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard statistical analysis utility for bootstrap power analysis, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and I would keep them as is, or slightly lower the risk score to reflect the benign nature more confidently.",
