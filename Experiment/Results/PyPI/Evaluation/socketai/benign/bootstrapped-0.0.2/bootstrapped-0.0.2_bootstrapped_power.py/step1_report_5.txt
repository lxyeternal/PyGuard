{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for performing power analysis, including generating power statistics, plotting power curves, and handling bootstrap results for statistical testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'bootstrap_result_list' input parameter, which is a list of objects with attributes like 'value', 'upper_bound', and 'lower_bound'. It also reads data from the pandas DataFrame created from this list.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources or network; it only processes and visualizes data internally. No sinks that could leak data or perform harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input list 'bootstrap_result_list' through the '_get_power_df' function into the DataFrame, then through statistical calculations in 'power_stats' and visualization in 'plot_power'. No external data sinks or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present. The code performs standard statistical and plotting operations without unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script includes functions for generating a DataFrame from bootstrap results, calculating summary statistics, and plotting power curves. It utilizes common libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, with no suspicious imports or obfuscated code. The logic is straightforward, involving data processing and visualization, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful commands. The code appears to be a legitimate statistical analysis tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for statistical power analysis and visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious sinks. Overall, it appears safe and purposeful for data analysis.",
