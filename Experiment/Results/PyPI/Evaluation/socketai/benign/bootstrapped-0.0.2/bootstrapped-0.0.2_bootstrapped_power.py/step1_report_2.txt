{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for power analysis, including generating dataframes of bootstrap results, calculating summary statistics, and plotting power-related metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters such as bootstrap_result_list, which is a list of BootstrapResults objects, and uses internal data structures for analysis.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include warnings, dataframes, and plots. No untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network connections. No sensitive data is read or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into functions that process bootstrap results, generate dataframes, compute statistics, and plot results. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears to be standard data analysis functions, with consistent use of standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (pandas, numpy, warnings, matplotlib), defines functions for processing bootstrap results related to power analysis, and generates statistical summaries and plots. It relies on user-provided bootstrap result objects and produces outputs that are typical for data analysis workflows. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code is well-structured and appears to serve its analytical purpose without hiding any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be legitimate data analysis code focused on power analysis and visualization. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is a standard implementation with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
