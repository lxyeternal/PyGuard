  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent utility for bootstrap power analysis with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.1) in some reports is conservative; these could be lowered to 0.0 given the benign nature of the code."
