{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for performing power analysis, including generating dataframes of bootstrap results, computing summary statistics, and plotting power analysis results.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function inputs such as bootstrap_result_list, and internally generates or processes data without external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code uses standard Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) for data processing and visualization. No sinks indicate untrusted data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (bootstrap_result_list) through data processing functions (_get_power_df, power_stats, plot_power), with no evident malicious data flow or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and consistent with statistical analysis practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard data processing, statistical calculations, and plotting functions for power analysis. It uses pandas and numpy appropriately, with warnings and plotting functions that do not involve untrusted data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The logic and structure are typical for scientific Python code, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, intended for statistical power analysis, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It relies solely on standard libraries and functions. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
