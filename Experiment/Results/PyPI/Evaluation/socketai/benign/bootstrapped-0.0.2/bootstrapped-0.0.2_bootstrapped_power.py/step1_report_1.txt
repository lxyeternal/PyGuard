{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for performing power analysis, statistical calculations, and plotting related to bootstrap results in a statistical analysis context.",
  "sources": "Imports pandas, numpy, and warnings modules; reads bootstrap result data structures and statistical values from passed arguments; reads data for plotting from bootstrap result list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions process data internally and generate plots, no external data exfiltration or harmful actions observed.",
  "flows": "Input bootstrap results are processed to generate a dataframe, which is then used to compute statistics and generate plots. Data flows from input list through dataframes to visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors. The code strictly performs statistical analysis and plotting, with no evidence of hidden or malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard data science libraries, defines functions to process bootstrap statistical results, and produce dataframes, summary statistics, and plots. The functions involve data transformations, calculations of significance, and visualization. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network communication, code injection, or data theft. The code appears legitimate for statistical analysis. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The initial comments specify licensing and copyright, indicating an open-source, research-focused utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for statistical power analysis and plotting, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs data processing, statistical summaries, and visualization securely and transparently.",
