  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - The code consists solely of mathematical functions for statistical comparisons: difference, percent change, ratio, and percent difference.\n   - Inputs are numpy arrays, and outputs are the result of arithmetic operations.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Risks:**\n   - The functions are utility calculations for A/B testing, a common and benign use case.\n   - The code is straightforward, with clear docstrings and no suspicious patterns.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with high confidence (mostly 1, some 0.9).\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n   - The reports are consistent and align well with the code's nature.\n   - The only consideration is whether any hidden malicious intent could be masked, but the code is transparent and standard.\n\n5. **Overall Risk Estimation:**\n   - Given the analysis, the code is a benign utility module.\n   - The highest risk might be if the functions are misused with untrusted data, but that is outside the scope of static code review and is typical for such utility functions.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a safe, standard utility module for statistical analysis in A/B testing, with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
