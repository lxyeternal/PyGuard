  "purpose": "Provides comparison functions for statistical analysis in A/B testing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: test_stat and ctrl_stat numpy arrays in each function.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output calculated numerical values based on input data.",
  "flows": "Input numpy arrays are processed through arithmetic operations and returned as results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple mathematical functions to compute differences, percent changes, ratios, and symmetric percent differences between test and control statistics. It uses basic arithmetic operations with no external data or network interactions. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The functions are straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility module for statistical comparisons in A/B testing. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation is clear and conventional.",
