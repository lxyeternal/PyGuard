{
  "purpose": "Provides various statistical comparison functions for bootstrap A/B testing analysis.",
  "sources": "None; functions operate on input parameters only.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return calculations based on inputs without external data effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (test_stat, ctrl_stat) through calculations and back as results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward mathematical functions without unusual or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple mathematical functions to compute differences, percent changes, ratios, and symmetric percent differences between test and control statistics. There are no input/output operations, no network or file access, and no code execution beyond basic calculations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The functions assume numpy array inputs but do not perform unsafe operations or external calls. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of statistical utility functions intended for analysis within an A/B testing framework. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
