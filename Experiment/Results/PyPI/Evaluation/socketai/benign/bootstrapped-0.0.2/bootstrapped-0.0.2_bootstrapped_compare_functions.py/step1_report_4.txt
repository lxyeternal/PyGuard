{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical comparison functions for use in bootstrap A/B tests, such as difference, percent change, ratio, and percent difference calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function arguments: test_stat and ctrl_stat, which are numpy arrays representing test and control statistics.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks, system compromise, or malicious activity. The functions simply perform mathematical operations on input data.",
  "flows": "Input numpy arrays (test_stat and ctrl_stat) are processed within each function to compute differences, ratios, and percent changes; no external or untrusted data flows or affects system states beyond calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code strictly performs mathematical computations. There is no use of dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward statistical functions operating on numpy arrays, with descriptive docstrings. No external data sources or outputs are involved other than returning calculated values. There are no obfuscation, suspicious logic, or potentially malicious constructs. The functions are isolated and do not perform any side effects or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard statistical comparison functions intended for analysis in A/B testing. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and unremarkable in terms of security.",
