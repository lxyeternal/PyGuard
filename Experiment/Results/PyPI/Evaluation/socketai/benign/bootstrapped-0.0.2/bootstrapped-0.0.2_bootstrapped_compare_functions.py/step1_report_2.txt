{
  "purpose": "Provides various statistical comparison functions for use in bootstrap A/B testing analyses.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; functions accept numpy array inputs which are assumed to be controlled data.",
  "sinks": "None evident; functions perform mathematical operations and return results.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (test_stat, ctrl_stat) through mathematical calculations to return values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; no external calls, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward mathematical functions for statistical calculations (difference, percent change, ratio, percent difference). It does not perform any I/O, network communication, or system modification. The code is well-structured and contains only standard mathematical operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of numpy arrays suggests it is designed for data analysis, which aligns with its purpose. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate statistical utility module for A/B testing analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
