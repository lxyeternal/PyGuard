  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a set of straightforward statistical functions operating on numpy arrays.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n   - No external system interactions, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident.\n   - The functions are standard mathematical calculations for A/B testing analysis.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent.\n   - They note the absence of obfuscation, suspicious code, or external interactions.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which seems reasonable given the straightforward code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely mathematical and has no malicious behavior, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - The reports' risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which matches the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's behavior.\n   - The functions accept numpy arrays and perform calculations without side effects.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a benign utility module for statistical calculations.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate.\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Note:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, standard, and free from security concerns.",
