{
  "purpose": "This code provides various statistical comparison functions for use in bootstrap A/B testing, such as difference, percent change, ratio, and percent difference.",
  "sources": "The functions take numpy array inputs 'test_stat' and 'ctrl_stat' which are likely from external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform mathematical operations on input arrays; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external system interaction are present.",
  "flows": "Input numpy arrays flow through the functions and return computed statistical metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward mathematical functions calculating differences, ratios, and percentages between test and control statistics. The functions use numpy arrays for calculations, and there is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard utility module for statistical analysis in A/B testing. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for statistical comparison functions used in A/B testing. It performs standard mathematical operations without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
