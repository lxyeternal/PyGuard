  "purpose": "Utility functions for statistical comparison in A/B testing, including difference, percent change, ratio, and percent difference calculations.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays: test_stat and ctrl_stat",
  "sinks": "Results of arithmetic operations; no external data or system interactions",
  "flows": "Input arrays -> arithmetic calculations -> output results",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; functions do not handle division by zero explicitly, but this is typical for such utilities",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward statistical functions operating on numpy arrays with clear docstrings. No obfuscation, malicious code, or external interactions are present. The functions perform basic arithmetic calculations, and the code is standard for A/B testing analysis. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The potential for division by zero exists but is a common issue in such calculations and not indicative of malicious intent. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for statistical analysis in A/B testing. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
