  "purpose": "This code snippet is a license header comment with no executable code or malicious content.",
  "sources": "The comment lines themselves, which contain licensing and copyright information.",
  "sinks": "There are no data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data flows present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist, as the code contains only comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns are present; the snippet is purely licensing metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comment lines with licensing information, with no executable code, data processing, or input/output mechanisms. There are no source, sink, or flow points, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the content. The confidence level is high (1), given the straightforward and standard licensing comments. No logical flaws or security concerns are evident, and the code poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header with no executable or malicious content. The reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
