  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code's actual content.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard implementation of permutation and bootstrap statistical testing.\n- It uses numpy, multiprocessing, and standard practices.\n- No external data transmission, code obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- Input validation, array handling, and parallelization are implemented as expected.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as functions for permutation shuffle tests.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Accurate; data is passed via parameters, no external data leaks.\n- **Flows:** Correctly outlines data shuffling, statistical calculations, and no external transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard numpy/multiprocessing use.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable assessment. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, correctly states the code's function.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No data leaks or harmful operations.\n- **Flows:** Correctly describes data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 also reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent with code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external leaks; data is processed internally.\n- **Flows:** Correct description.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No data leaks; processing within scope.\n- **Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external communication.\n- **Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code appears clean, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected; all reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2), which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; all analyses are cautious and appropriate.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk scores:** Given the code's straightforward statistical nature, all scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score (~0.1), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\nBased on the detailed review:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (standard statistical code, very low security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate implementation of permutation testing, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
