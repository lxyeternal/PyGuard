{
  "purpose": "The code implements permutation shuffle tests for statistical hypothesis testing, allowing comparison of test and control data using various statistics and comparison functions.",
  "sources": "Data inputs come from the parameters 'test', 'ctrl', 'test_denominator', and 'ctrl_denominator', which are numpy arrays or sparse matrices. Random seed inputs and internal numpy random functions generate randomness.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include numpy random seed setting, numpy random choice, and the application of compare functions which could be exploited if malicious input is provided. No network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation functions, then into permutation generation and distribution functions, with results processed through statistic and comparison functions, culminating in a permutation test result or distribution return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code follows standard statistical permutation test procedures with no obfuscated or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard permutation test methods, including array validation, distribution generation, parallel processing for efficiency, and statistical comparisons. Random seed usage is controlled, and no network or file operations occur. All data transformations and function calls are typical for this type of statistical testing. The code is clean, well-structured, and adheres to expected practices for such testing procedures. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate statistical permutation tests with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses standard numpy functions and multiprocessing for performance. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious data exfiltration. The overall security risk is minimal.",
