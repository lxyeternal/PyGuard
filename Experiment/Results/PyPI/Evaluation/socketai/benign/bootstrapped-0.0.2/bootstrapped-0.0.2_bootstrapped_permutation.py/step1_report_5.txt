{
  "purpose": "The code implements permutation shuffle tests for statistical hypothesis testing, allowing for bootstrap confidence intervals and significance calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from provided numpy arrays (test, ctrl, denominators) and random seed values for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable manipulations are present. No data leaks or external communication points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through permutation and statistical functions, culminating in the calculation of p-values or significance metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions; no suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs statistical permutation testing with optional multithreading. It validates array inputs, generates random permutations, and computes significance scores. No suspicious data handling or network activity is observed. The only potential concern is the use of random seed setting and large memory operations, which are typical for statistical computations. The code appears clean and standard for statistical testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate permutation testing for statistical analysis with no signs of malicious behavior. It handles inputs securely and processes data in a typical manner for such statistical procedures.",
