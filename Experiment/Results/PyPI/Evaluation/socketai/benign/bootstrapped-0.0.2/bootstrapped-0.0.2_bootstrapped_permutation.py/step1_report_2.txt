{
  "purpose": "The code implements permutation shuffle tests for statistical analysis, including functions for generating distributions, running permutations, and calculating p-values or confidence intervals for A/B testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays or scipy sparse matrices provided as test and control datasets, as well as optional denominators for ratio calculations. It also reads system seed values for random number generation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain evident sinks that could leak data or perform harmful actions. It mainly processes data within the scope of statistical calculations. No network communication, file operations, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Input datasets are combined and shuffled using numpy's random choice, with permutation results computed via specified statistical functions. These results are then compared to original statistics to produce p-values or confidence metrics.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code uses standard numpy and multiprocessing functions without obfuscation or unusual constructs. No dynamic code execution, encryption, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard numpy functions for array operations, shuffles data for permutation testing, and employs multiprocessing to speed up simulations. It validates input arrays, manages random seed setting, and limits iterations for large datasets. No signs of malicious logic, data leakage, or malicious external interactions are present. The code appears to be a typical implementation of permutation testing for statistical analysis, with no suspicious or harmful components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of permutation shuffle tests for statistical hypothesis testing. It performs data shuffling, statistical calculations, and comparisons without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks in the provided code.",
