{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions for performing permutation shuffle tests and bootstrap confidence intervals for statistical analysis, primarily used in A/B testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays or scipy sparse matrices passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file or network operations, or malicious data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data is shuffled via random permutations; statistical functions are applied to these permutations; results are aggregated to compute p-values or confidence intervals.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of numpy, multiprocessing, and random seed setting; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs permutation testing using numpy for data shuffling and multiprocessing for parallel execution. It validates input array types and shapes, generates permutations, and computes test statistics across multiple iterations. Random seed setting ensures reproducibility. No external communication or malicious behavior is present. The implementation is consistent with standard statistical testing practices, with appropriate safeguards and validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of permutation and bootstrap statistical tests with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It uses common libraries and practices suitable for scientific computing. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the code's benign nature.",
