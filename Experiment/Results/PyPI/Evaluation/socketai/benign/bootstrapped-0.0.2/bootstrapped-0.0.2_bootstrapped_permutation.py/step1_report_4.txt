{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to perform permutation shuffle tests for statistical hypothesis testing, mainly for analyzing differences between groups in data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays for test and control groups, and reads random seed values from numpy's random functions.",
  "sinks": "Generates permutation distributions, statistical results, and returns numerical outcomes. No direct data leaks or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Input data arrays are validated, combined, shuffled, and processed through permutation simulations; results are calculated via statistical functions, then used in comparison functions to produce final results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of numpy and multiprocessing for parallel processing is standard. No unusual or obfuscated language features detected. All data manipulations appear typical for statistical testing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a permutation test procedure with functions to validate arrays, generate permutation distributions, run simulations in parallel, and compute p-values or significance scores. It uses numpy for data handling and multiprocessing for speed. No code indicates malicious behavior; all operations serve statistical computations. No external network or system modification activity observed. The code structure is straightforward, with proper validation and standard library usage, showing no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of permutation testing functions for statistical analysis. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It is well-structured for its purpose and does not exhibit any suspicious activities or malware characteristics.",
