The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score should be very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to multiprocessing and randomness but no malicious behavior."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.1) in some reports is conservative; these could be lowered to 0.0 given the benign nature of the code."
