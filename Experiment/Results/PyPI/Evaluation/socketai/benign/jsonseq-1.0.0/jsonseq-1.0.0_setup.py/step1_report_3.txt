  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute the 'jsonseq' Python library, providing metadata and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description, and calls the setup() function with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function processes package information; no untrusted data is passed to dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "File reading (README.md) data flows into the setup configuration, which is then used for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup tools without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, reads a README file, and calls setup() with static metadata. There are no user inputs, no dynamic code execution, nor any network or file operations that could be exploited. All operations are typical for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign, adhering to standard packaging practices without any malicious intent or security risks.",
