  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'jsonseq' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, extracting package information, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; no network, file, or environment variable exploits present.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file as source, then passing static data into setup() functions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution; standard setuptools usage.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py file, importing setup utilities, reading the README file for description, and configuring package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is involved. The code performs static configuration with hardcoded package info and dependencies, which is typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this setup script. It is a standard package configuration file with no suspicious or malicious code.",
