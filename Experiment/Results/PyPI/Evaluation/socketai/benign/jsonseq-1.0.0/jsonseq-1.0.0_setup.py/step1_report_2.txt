{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'jsonseq'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package metadata from setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or external system interactions beyond reading local files.",
  "flows": "Reads local README.md file to incorporate into package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard setup tools and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration using setuptools, reading the README.md for description, and defining package metadata. All operations are safe and typical for Python packaging scripts. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network interactions, or hidden behaviors. The script appears to be a normal setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a legitimate and standard configuration file for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious code or suspicious behaviors. It is safe to use.",
