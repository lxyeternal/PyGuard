  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README file and defines package metadata without any dynamic or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate a benign configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
