  "purpose": "Defines the package with a version string, likely a placeholder or minimal implementation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only a version declaration; no suspicious or unusual code activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is extremely simple, consisting only of a docstring comment and a version assignment. There are no input sources, sinks, or complex logic that could be exploited or are indicative of malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, and no data handling or network operations are present. The package appears to be a placeholder or minimal setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a benign minimal package declaration.",
