{
  "purpose": "Minimal package metadata declaration containing only a version string and a docstring.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output data or interact externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with a docstring and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module-level docstring and a version string assignment. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is typical for a package's metadata file, serving as a version indicator. Given its simplicity and lack of external interactions, there are no security concerns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and free of security risks or malicious behavior. The existing scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
