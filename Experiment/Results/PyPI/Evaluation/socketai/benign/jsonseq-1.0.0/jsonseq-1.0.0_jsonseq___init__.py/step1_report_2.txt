  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Lacks functionality, no operations or data handling observed; simply a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single comment describing the package, an empty docstring, and a version string assignment. No code executes any data processing, input/output, or external interactions. There are no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a minimal placeholder or metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
