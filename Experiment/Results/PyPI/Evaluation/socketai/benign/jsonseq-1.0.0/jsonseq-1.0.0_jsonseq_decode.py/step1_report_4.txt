  "purpose": "Decode Python objects from a stream of JSON texts, specifically handling RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequence decoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'seq' which is an iterable of JSON string fragments or lines.",
  "targets": "No explicit targets for untrusted data to leak or effect; the code merely decodes JSON data.",
  "flows": "Input lines are accumulated into a buffer, then decoded into Python objects via json.JSONDecoder.decode().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Uses standard JSON decoding. No suspicious string manipulations beyond normal RFC parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to decode JSON sequences following RFC 7464, handling special record separator characters. It properly buffers and decodes JSON fragments, avoiding unsafe operations. No external data is sent or retrieved, no system commands are invoked. The logic appears to be a standard parser implementation without obfuscation or malicious behavior. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard JSON sequence decoder tailored for RFC 7464 GeoJSON text sequences. It performs safe JSON decoding operations without any malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
