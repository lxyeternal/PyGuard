  "purpose": "Decode Python objects from a stream of JSON texts, specifically for RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequence format.",
  "sources": "Reads data from an iterable 'seq', which provides JSON strings or pieces of strings.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.JSONDecoder().decode() on the accumulated buffer; no external sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'seq' iterable into buffer, then through json.decoder to produce decoded objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a JSON stream decoder for a specific text sequence format. It checks for the start-of-record marker, manages a buffer for multi-line JSON objects, and decodes JSON strings into Python objects. No external network activity, system modifications, or malicious patterns are present. Usage of standard Python libraries (json) and no suspicious code paths suggest low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured JSON stream decoder tailored for RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequence. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
