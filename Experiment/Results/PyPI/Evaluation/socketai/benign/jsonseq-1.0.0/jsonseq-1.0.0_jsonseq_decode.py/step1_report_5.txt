  "purpose": "Decode Python objects from a stream of JSON texts, specifically handling RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequence decoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'seq' which is an iterable of JSON string segments.",
  "sinks": "Potential decoding of JSON strings into Python objects via json.JSONDecoder().",
  "flows": "Input 'seq' is iterated; lines are processed, possibly concatenated, and then decoded into Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and handles input parsing. No external network or system interaction is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for decoding JSON sequences following RFC 7464. It processes input line-by-line, handling special record separator characters ('\\x1e') to delimit JSON objects. It buffers lines between record separators and decodes the buffer once a complete JSON object is assembled. No external data is transmitted, no sensitive information is accessed, and there are no hidden behaviors or obfuscation. The code uses standard Python libraries and typical parsing logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard JSON decoding with handling for a specific streaming format. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be a legitimate parser implementation for a specific data format.",
