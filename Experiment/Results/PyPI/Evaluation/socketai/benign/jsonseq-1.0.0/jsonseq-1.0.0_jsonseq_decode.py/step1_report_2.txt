  "purpose": "Decode Python objects from a stream of JSON texts following RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequence decoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'seq' which is an iterable of JSON strings or pieces of strings.",
  "sinks": "The decode method outputs Python objects via yield; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the decode method, is accumulated in 'buffer' based on start characters, then passed to json.JSONDecoder.decode() for deserialization, and output as Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code straightforwardly implements a standard decoding process for RFC 7464 data format.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a JSONSeqDecoder class that initializes a json.JSONDecoder instance. The decode method processes an iterable of strings, checking if lines start with the control character \\x1e, indicating the start of a new JSON text sequence. It accumulates lines in 'buffer' until a new sequence is detected or the iterable ends, then decodes each complete JSON object and yields it. The process adheres to RFC 7464 specifications without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no evident security issues such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for decoding RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequences. It performs no malicious actions, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. It is a normal, well-structured JSON decoder for a specific format.",
