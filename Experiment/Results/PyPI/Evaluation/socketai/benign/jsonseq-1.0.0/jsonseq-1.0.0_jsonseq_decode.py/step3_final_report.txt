  "purpose": "Decode Python objects from a stream of RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequence data, handling record separators and buffering.",
  "sources": "Input lines from the iterable 'seq', which may contain JSON strings or parts of strings, including optional record separator characters.",
  "sinks": "Decoded JSON objects yielded by the decoder; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Lines are read from 'seq'; if record separator is detected, buffered lines are decoded into JSON objects; otherwise, lines are accumulated until a separator or end of input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation with standard JSON decoding; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements RFC 7464 decoding by detecting record separators ('\\x1e'), buffering lines, and decoding JSON objects with json.JSONDecoder. It handles input streams safely without external network activity or data leaks. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports (0 or 0.1) are justified given the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of an RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequence decoder. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's function.",
