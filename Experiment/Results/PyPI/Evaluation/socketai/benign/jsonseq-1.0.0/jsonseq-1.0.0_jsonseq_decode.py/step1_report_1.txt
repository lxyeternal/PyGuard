Use of 'json.JSONDecoder' is standard. Buffer handling appears typical for RFC 7464 streams.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code reads from an iterable 'seq', detects the start of RFC 7464 data via the '\\x1e' delimiter, buffers lines accordingly, and decodes JSON objects from the accumulated text. The logic is consistent with RFC 7464 decoding. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. No external network calls or data leaks are present. The code appears safe and purpose-specific.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This code is a straightforward RFC 7464 GeoJSON Text Sequence decoder with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs expected stream parsing and JSON decoding functions without suspicious features.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
