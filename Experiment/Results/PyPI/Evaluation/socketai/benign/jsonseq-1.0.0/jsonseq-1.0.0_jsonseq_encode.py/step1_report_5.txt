{
  "purpose": "The code encodes Python objects into a JSON sequence format following RFC 7464, optionally adding record separators.",
  "sources": "Input data from the iterable provided to encode or iterencode methods.",
  "sinks": "Yields from encode and iterencode methods, outputting JSON strings; no external system interactions or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the iterable source through encoding methods, outputting formatted JSON strings; no external data flows or untrusted sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward implementation of RFC 7464 JSON Text Sequence encoding. It uses json.JSONEncoder to serialize objects and optionally adds record separator characters. The methods yield JSON strings or parts thereof, suitable for streaming. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or other side effects beyond string formatting and JSON encoding. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of JSON sequence encoding without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk level is minimal.",
