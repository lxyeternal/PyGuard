  "purpose": "Encodes sequences of Python objects into JSON format with optional RFC 7464 RS delimiters.",
  "sources": "Iterable input of Python objects to encode.",
  "sinks": "Yielded JSON strings, potentially with delimiters.",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> encode() or iterencode() -> yield JSON strings or parts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a JSON sequence encoder, utilizing standard libraries and simple string formatting. It does not perform any network operations, handle secrets, or execute malicious actions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The confidence levels are high, and no flaws or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and use of standard libraries further confirm its benign intent. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard JSON sequence encoder with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scoring in all reports is appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
