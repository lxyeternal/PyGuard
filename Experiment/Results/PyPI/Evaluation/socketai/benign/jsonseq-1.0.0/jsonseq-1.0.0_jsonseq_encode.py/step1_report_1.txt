{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to encode sequences of Python objects into JSON format with optional RFC 7464 RS delimiters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from an iterable object passed to encode() or iterencode() methods.",
  "nets": "The code does not contain explicit untrusted data sinks; it outputs encoded JSON strings, which could be used downstream.",
  "flows": "Input data (sources) are read via iterable; encoded and yielded as JSON strings (potentially with RS delimiters) (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Uses standard json library, no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward JSON encoder class with optional RFC 7464 RS delimiters. It reads from an iterable input and encodes each object into JSON, optionally prefixing with the RS character. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No handling of untrusted data beyond simple encoding, and no network, system modifications, or credential handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JSON sequence encoder with optional RFC 7464 delimiter support. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities are present.",
