  "purpose": "Encodes sequences of Python objects into JSON format with optional RFC 7464 RS delimiters.",
  "sources": "Input iterable of Python objects provided to encode() and iterencode() methods.",
  "sinks": "Generated JSON string outputs; no external sinks or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> encode/iterencode methods -> output JSON strings with optional delimiters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, no cryptographic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for encoding Python objects into JSON lines with optional RS delimiters as per RFC 7464. It uses standard json.JSONEncoder for serialization. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, and no suspicious operations. The methods simply iterate over provided data, encode each object, and yield formatted strings. No input validation issues or potential injection points are present. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard JSON encoding with optional RFC 7464 RS delimiters. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It appears to be safe and benign.",
