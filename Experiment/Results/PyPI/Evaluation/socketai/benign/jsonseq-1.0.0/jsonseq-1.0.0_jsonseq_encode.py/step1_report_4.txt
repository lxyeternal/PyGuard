  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for encoding sequences of Python objects into JSON format with optional RFC 7464 RS delimiters.",
  "sources": "Input iterable of Python objects to encode, potentially external data provided to the encode() or iterencode() methods.",
  "sinks": "Encoded JSON strings yielded by encode() or iterencode() methods, potentially output to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> encode() or iterencode() -> JSON encoding -> optional RS delimiters -> yielded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The use of standard libraries and straightforward encoding process appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for JSON encoding with optional RFC 7464 RS delimiters. It accepts an iterable of objects, encodes each object into JSON, and yields the result. The encode() method produces complete JSON objects with delimiters, while iterencode() yields JSON parts, optionally including RS delimiters. The code utilizes Python's standard json module, with no apparent data leakage, external network calls, or suspicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques. All operations are standard serialization procedures, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for JSON serialization with RFC 7464 formatting support. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It functions solely as a data encoding helper.",
