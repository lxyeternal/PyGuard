  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the details:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is purely data modeling and serialization/deserialization functions for secret management and authentication. No network, file, or system command operations are present. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with type assertions and data class methods, typical for SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is standard data handling for secrets/auth, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The code is safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n- **Assessment:** Cannot evaluate, but the absence of information suggests no malicious content. No evidence to suggest otherwise.\n- **Scores:** No basis for malware or obfuscation. Risk remains at 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is mainly data classes and serialization/deserialization functions, with no external system calls or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is safe, serving as a data handling layer.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, network activity, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's structure. No suspicious signals detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. All reports confirm that the code is standard data modeling and serialization logic.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected. The code does not perform any network, file, or system operations that could be malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None. The code is straightforward, with clear data classes and functions.\n- **Security risk:** Low. The code is primarily for data handling, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\nAll reports consistently indicate that this code is a benign, well-structured SDK component for managing secrets and authentication data. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, safe part of a secrets management SDK, with no supply chain security issues.",
