  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently state that the code is a straightforward set of import statements from internal modules, primarily related to secret management, encryption, decryption, and authentication.\n- They uniformly find no evidence of data processing, external input handling, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9), and all reports assign malware scores of 0.\n- Some reports assign minimal security risk scores (0.2), which seem to reflect the package's potential exposure if misused, but not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident in the code snippet. The code only imports classes and sets a version string.\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:** No logical errors or flaws are identified; the code appears well-structured and typical for a package's initialization or module setup.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n  - Security risk: very low, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n### Justification of Scores:\n- The **malware score of 0** is justified; no malicious activity or code is present.\n- The **risk score** of around 0.2-0.3 in some reports seems to be a conservative estimate reflecting the package's potential impact if compromised, but not an actual vulnerability.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- **Claims based on assumptions:** All reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities where none are evident.\n- **Potential for malicious activity:** Since the code only imports classes and sets a version, there is no basis for suspicion.\n- **Consistency:** The scores and conclusions are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, my estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — very low, reflecting that the package handles secrets and authentication, which could be sensitive if misused, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.**",
