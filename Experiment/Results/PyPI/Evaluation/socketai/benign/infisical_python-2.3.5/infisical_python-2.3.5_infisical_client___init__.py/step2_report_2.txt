  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a package that provides secret management, encryption, decryption, and auth interfaces. No external data sources or untrusted input sources are involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows; only class imports.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed; straightforward import statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing module initialization and class exports.\n- No external data or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on import statements related to secret management and auth options.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the benign nature of the import setup.\n- No data processing or malicious signals.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with emphasis on the package's role.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) and confidence (0.9), but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative but acceptable; no actual malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for discrepancies:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the straightforward import structure.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very low (0.2), which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code confirmation:** The code snippet is purely import statements and a version string; no processing, dynamic code, or external data handling.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident. All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- **Scores justification:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature. The slightly elevated risk score in report 5 (0.2) is conservative but acceptable, given the cautious approach in security assessments.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at 0 or, if desired, a minimal 0.1 for general caution, but 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured module setup for a secret management SDK. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0.2 as per report 5's conservative estimate)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best practices in security review.",
