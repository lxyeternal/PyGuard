  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scores based on the provided code snippet.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a set of straightforward import statements and a version string assignment.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external input handling is present.\n- All imports are from internal modules, with no external data sources or untrusted input.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The code structure appears typical for a Python SDK or package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard interface setup for secret management, encryption, authentication.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic execution, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Module import setup for secret management and encryption.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward imports, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Importing classes and options for secret management SDK.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Re-exporting classes for a secrets management SDK.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Importing classes for secret management and authentication.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — **questionable.**\n\n**Justification for securityRisk=0.2:**  \nWhile the code is benign, the report assigns a slight security risk perhaps due to the nature of the package (handling secrets, authentication). However, based solely on this code snippet, the risk is minimal. The \"securityRisk\" score could be set to 0 unless there's context indicating potential misuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious activity.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero across all reports.\n- The only questionable score is in Report 5's securityRisk=0.2, which appears to be an overestimation given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all, given no dynamic or risky behavior observed.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign module setup for a secrets management SDK, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores are appropriate, except for the minor securityRisk score in Report 5, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider context; if future code or runtime behavior shows dynamic data handling or external inputs, reassessment would be necessary.",
