{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization module importing various classes and options related to secret management, encryption, decryption, and authentication methods for a Python SDK or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module imports (.schemas, .infisical_client, .infisical_py) during module import time.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks; the code only imports classes and sets a version string.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statements; there are no runtime data flows or external data processing in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of import statements and a version string assignment, typical for a package's __init__.py. No dynamic code, external input handling, or malicious behavior is evident. All imports are from internal modules, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. The slight elevation of risk in some reports (0.2) appears conservative but acceptable. Overall, the code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a secret management SDK. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.",
