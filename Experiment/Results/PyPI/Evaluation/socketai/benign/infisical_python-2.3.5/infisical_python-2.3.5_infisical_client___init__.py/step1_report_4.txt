{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that re-exports various classes and functions related to secrets management, encryption, decryption, and authentication methods for a larger SDK or application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data directly; it imports classes and functions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident in this code snippet; it does not handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and assigns aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and only contains import statements and an attribute assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports and an assignment of the version string. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic execution. All imported modules are local, and the code does not contain any runtime logic that could be malicious. The version string is static. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Overall, this code appears to be a normal, benign part of a larger library, with no security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that re-exports classes related to secrets management and authentication, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
