  "purpose": "This code provides a Python client interface for interacting with an Infisical secret management system, including secret management, encryption, and decryption functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables using os.environ.get in listSecrets method; reads/writes data via JSON serialization/deserialization; imports modules and classes; uses class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.environ to set environment variables; calls inner.run_command which executes commands possibly involving external systems; raises exceptions on error responses; processes and returns secret data.",
  "flows": "getSecret/listSecrets/updateSecret/deleteSecret/createSecret/createSymmetricKey/encryptSymmetric/decryptSymmetric methods all invoke _run_command, which serializes commands, sends them to inner.run_command, and processes responses; listSecrets writes secrets to environment variables if attach_to_process_env is True.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not appear to contain obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The only potential concern is environment variable modification which is controlled and explicitly documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a client API wrapping around a Rust-based backend. It serializes commands and processes responses. It modifies environment variables only based on secret data in a controlled manner. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden payloads are evident. No obfuscated code, cryptic variable names, or suspicious logic is present. All operations appear to be standard for a secret management SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK client for secret management, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. Its functions are typical, and environmental modifications are explicit and controlled. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
