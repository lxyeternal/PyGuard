{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python SDK wrapper around a Rust client for managing secrets and cryptographic operations via the Infisical platform.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration settings, command parameters, and secret options; accesses environment variables; processes JSON responses from the Rust client.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes secrets via environment variables; raises exceptions based on response errors; processes secret data and cryptographic responses.",
  "flows": "Input options and settings are serialized to JSON, sent to the Rust client, and responses are parsed back into Python objects. Secrets may be injected into environment variables if specified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Use of environment variables is controlled and explicitly conditioned. No obfuscated code features present. No suspicious network activity or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around a Rust-based client, managing secrets and cryptographic functions. It serializes settings and commands into JSON, invokes the Rust client, and deserializes responses. Environment variable modification is conditional and aimed at ease of use. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network misuse, or backdoors are evident. The only notable behavior is environment variable injection, which is controlled by user options and not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious code features or obfuscation are present. The code appears well-structured and consistent with standard SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as an SDK interface for secret management and cryptography. No malicious intent or security risks are identified based on this analysis.",
