  "purpose": "Python SDK wrapper around a Rust backend for secret management and cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, environment variables, responses from the Rust client.",
  "sinks": "Returning secret data, setting environment variables with secrets, raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input options → JSON serialization → Rust client call → JSON response → parsing and returning data or setting env vars.",
  "anomalies": "Setting secrets into environment variables based on options; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK that serializes requests, communicates with a Rust backend, and processes responses. It conditionally sets environment variables with secrets, which is documented and controlled. No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The environment variable handling could pose security risks if environment is shared, but this is a known pattern and not malicious. Error handling is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK with no malicious intent. The only security consideration is the injection of secrets into environment variables, which is a common pattern but should be used cautiously. Overall, the supply chain security risk is low.",
