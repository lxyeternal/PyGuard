{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python SDK wrapper for interacting with the Infisical secrets management system, including secret retrieval, listing, updating, deleting, and cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Data sources include function parameters such as settings, options objects (e.g., GetSecretOptions), and environment variables (via os.environ). The inner Rust client also acts as a data source when calling run_command.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks include returning secret data, environment variables, and potentially exceptions raised from response errors. Response data may contain secrets or sensitive info, especially when secrets are attached to environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input options (from function calls) are serialized to JSON and sent to the inner Rust client, which executes commands and returns JSON responses. Responses are deserialized, with secret data returned directly or stored in environment variables if specified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code directly sets environment variables based on secret data if requested, which could lead to security issues if secrets are sensitive. The use of exceptions for error reporting is standard. No obfuscation or unusual language features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code acts mainly as a wrapper around the Rust client, serializing commands and parsing responses. It manages secrets securely by not hardcoding sensitive info but writes secrets into environment variables if requested, which could be risky. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors like network exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized data access are present. It correctly handles errors via exceptions. The code's operations are typical for SDKs interacting with external secrets management systems. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK wrapper for secret management with no malicious behavior detected. It handles secrets responsibly by avoiding hardcoded secrets, though writing secrets into environment variables could be a security concern depending on context. Overall, the code appears safe and aligns with expected SDK functionality.",
