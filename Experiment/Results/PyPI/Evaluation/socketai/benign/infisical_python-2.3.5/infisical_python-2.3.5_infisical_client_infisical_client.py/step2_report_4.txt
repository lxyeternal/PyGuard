  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward SDK wrapper around a Rust backend for secret management and cryptographic operations.\n- Common data sources include function parameters, environment variables, and responses from the Rust client.\n- Common sinks include returning secret data, setting environment variables, and raising exceptions.\n- All reports note that secrets are stored in environment variables if requested, which could be a security concern but is explicitly documented.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious network activity are detected.\n- The analysis across reports consistently finds the code to be standard, well-structured, and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- **No hardcoded secrets or credentials** are present.\n- **Environment variable modification** occurs only based on explicit options, and is controlled.\n- **No obfuscated code** or malicious constructs are identified.\n- **Secret handling** appears standard for an SDK.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify that environment variable setting could be a security concern but is a controlled feature.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware = 0**, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n  - **obfuscated = 0**, consistent with straightforward code.\n  - **securityRisk** scores are low (0.1 to 0.3), reflecting minimal security concerns primarily around environment variable handling.\n  - **confidence** is high (0.9), justified by consistent findings.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- The only potential concern is environment variable handling, which is documented and controlled, not malicious.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports assign **malware = 0**, which is justified.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior or malware.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observed behavior, such as environment variable setting, which is explicitly controlled.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** Given the controlled environment variable handling and absence of malicious behavior, a **risk score of around 0.2** seems appropriate. The existing reports' scores (0.1 to 0.3) are reasonable.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate SDK wrapper with minimal security concerns, primarily around environment variable handling, which is controlled and documented. No evidence of malware or obfuscation exists.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The detailed review confirms that the reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No significant changes are necessary.",
