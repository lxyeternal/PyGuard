{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python SDK wrapper for interacting with a secret management system via a Rust-based client, allowing operations such as retrieving, listing, creating, updating, deleting secrets, and cryptographic functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method parameters (settings, options) passed to various functions, environment variables accessed via os.environ, and internal calls to the Rust client with JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from the Rust client (via JSON), environment variables set in listSecrets method, and exceptions raised from error responses. No direct data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "Parameters (settings, options) -> JSON serialization -> Rust client invocation -> JSON response -> processing and returning data; environment variables are set during secrets listing based on secret keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; the environment variable modification is noteworthy but intended for configuration purposes. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around a Rust client, serializing/deserializing JSON data for secret management operations. Environment variables are set based on secret keys if attach_to_process_env is true, which could influence process environment but is a documented feature. No external network communication, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The usage appears to be straightforward and consistent with intended SDK functionality. No signs of malicious code, sabotage, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK wrapper for secret management with environment variable handling. No malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks are detected. The only noteworthy behavior is environment variable setting, which aligns with typical SDK practices. Overall security risk is low.",
