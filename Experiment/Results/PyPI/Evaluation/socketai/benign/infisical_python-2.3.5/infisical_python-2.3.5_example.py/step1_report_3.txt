{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a client for the Infisical secret management service and repeatedly retrieves a secret named 'TEST' from a specified project and environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded credentials (client_id and client_secret), and fetches secrets from the Infisical API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "The secret value retrieved by client.getSecret() is printed, which could lead to exposure if the output is not secured.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded credentials are used to authenticate API requests (source), which then fetch secret data (sink) and print it to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "Credentials are hardcoded within the script, which is a security concern. The site_url points to localhost, suggesting local testing; no other suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses explicit credentials for API access, which poses a security risk if this code is shared or exposed publicly. The loop repeatedly fetches and prints a secret, potentially exposing sensitive data in logs or console output. No malicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for testing or local development purposes. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates legitimate usage of the Infisical client for secret retrieval but hardcodes sensitive credentials, which is insecure for production. The continuous printing of secrets also poses a risk of accidental exposure. Overall, no malware or malicious behavior is evident, but security practices should be improved.",
