{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of the InfisicalClient to retrieve secrets from a local server, repeatedly fetching and printing a secret named 'TEST' in an infinite loop.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from hardcoded credentials (`client_id`, `client_secret`) and the secret management system via `client.getSecret()` calls.",
  "sinks": "The secret value is output directly to the console via `print(secret.secret_value)`, which could lead to secret leakage if logs are accessed by unauthorized users.",
  "flows": "The code uses hardcoded credentials as sources, which are used in `client.getSecret()` calls (sources), and the secret value retrieved flows into the `print()` sink, with no intermediate validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an infinite loop without delay or error handling, repeatedly fetching and printing secrets, which is inefficient and risky. Credentials are hardcoded, and secrets are printed directly, increasing security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses hardcoded credentials (`client_id`, `client_secret`) and performs repeated secret retrievals in an infinite loop, printing secrets directly. These practices pose security risks such as credential exposure, resource exhaustion, and secret leakage. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The environment is local, reducing external attack surface but not mitigating internal security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these observations, though the security risk could be rated higher due to the severity of insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure practices—hardcoded credentials, continuous secret fetching, and secret printing—without evidence of malicious intent. The primary concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which warrants a high security risk score. No malware or obfuscation is detected.",
