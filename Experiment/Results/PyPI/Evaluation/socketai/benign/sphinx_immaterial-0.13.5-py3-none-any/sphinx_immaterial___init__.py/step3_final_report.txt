  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Sphinx HTML builder and theme setup functions, managing static assets, URL handling, and configuration merging for a Sphinx theme.",
  "sources": "Configuration options, theme directories, static asset files, URL parsing functions, extension setup routines.",
  "sinks": "File copying operations, URL manipulations, logging warnings, extension registrations.",
  "flows": "Merging theme options into context, copying static assets with exclusions, URL generation for documentation pages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, no suspicious dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard theme setup tasks: managing static assets, customizing URL generation, merging configurations, and registering extensions. It includes filtering static files and URLs, which are typical for theme customization. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's operations are transparent and align with best practices for Sphinx theme development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Sphinx theme extension with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
