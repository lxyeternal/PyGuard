{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Sphinx theme extension for 'Sphinx-Immaterial,' customizing HTML build process, static asset handling, and theme options.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration options, theme directory paths, and static assets. Uses imported modules for extension setup.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions for copying static files and setting up extension configurations, but no data flow to untrusted sinks or network connections is evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from user settings into theme options and static file handling; no external data flows or untrusted input processing are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials found. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Static asset exclusion is normal theme behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily modifies theme assets, manages static files, merges configurations, and sets up extension hooks. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The static file exclusion lists are typical for theme customization. No untrusted input handling or risky code constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate theme extension for Sphinx with standard configuration merging, static asset management, and setup routines. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
