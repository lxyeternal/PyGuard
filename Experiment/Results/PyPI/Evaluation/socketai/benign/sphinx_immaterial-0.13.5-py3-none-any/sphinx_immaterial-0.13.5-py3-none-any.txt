      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, controlled extension for Sphinx documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It modifies internal parsing behavior in a safe manner. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven extension for enhancing search index navigation in Sphinx. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern relates to index file integrity and trustworthiness of URLs, which is outside the code scope but relevant for deployment. Overall, it is safe with a minor security consideration."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Sphinx extension for rendering keyboard shortcuts. The only notable issue is the flawed handling of the import error, which could cause runtime errors but does not introduce security risks or malware. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1."
