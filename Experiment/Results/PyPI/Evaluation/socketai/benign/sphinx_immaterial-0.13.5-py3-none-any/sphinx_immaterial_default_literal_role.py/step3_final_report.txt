{
  "purpose": "A Sphinx extension that overrides the interpretation of double backtick literals to use a configurable role.",
  "sources": "Internal dispatch table `Inliner.dispatch`, context managers, and method overrides.",
  "sinks": "Modification of `Inliner.dispatch` and `CustomReSTDispatcher` attributes; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Code reads and modifies `Inliner.dispatch` during setup and within context managers; patches `CustomReSTDispatcher` enable/disable behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns. Use of monkey patching is standard for plugin customization.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates internal dispatch tables to customize literal role interpretation in Sphinx. It employs context managers and monkey patching to temporarily or permanently override default behaviors. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The approach is typical for plugin development, and the code is straightforward and well-structured. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if roles are set from untrusted sources, but in standard use, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, controlled extension for Sphinx documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It modifies internal parsing behavior in a safe manner. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
