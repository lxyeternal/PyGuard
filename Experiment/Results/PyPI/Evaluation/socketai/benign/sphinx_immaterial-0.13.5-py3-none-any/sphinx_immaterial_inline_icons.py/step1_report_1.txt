{
  "purpose": "This module adds support for custom SVG icons in Sphinx documentation themes, allowing SVG files to be loaded from specified paths or bundled with the theme, and integrated into HTML output as CSS-styled spans.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration variables (sphinx_immaterial_icon_path), accesses filesystem to load SVG files, reads SVG file content, and processes role input text.",
  "sinks": "Reads SVG files from the filesystem; constructs CSS class names for HTML spans.",
  "flows": "Configuration paths → SVG file existence check → SVG file read → SVG data stored in environment → Icon role processing → HTML span output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code reads files based on user-supplied configuration and role input, but these are standard for such plugins.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads SVG files from specified paths or bundled resources, converting icon names into file paths and reading their content. It constructs HTML spans with CSS classes to display icons, based on role input. No malicious code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity is present. The functions are straightforward and serve documentation rendering purposes. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected. The file handles file reading carefully with existence checks and raises appropriate errors if SVGs are missing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Sphinx extension for handling custom SVG icons. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond the typical file reading operations, which are performed safely. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malware are present.",
