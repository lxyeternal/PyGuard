{
  "purpose": "This module adds support for custom SVG icons and icon roles in a Sphinx documentation theme, allowing icons to be loaded from specified static paths or bundled defaults.",
  "sources": "Paths read from the filesystem: static directories specified in 'sphinx_immaterial_icon_path' config, and internal bundle directory.",
  "sinks": "Reading SVG files from filesystem to embed their content into the environment for CSS generation.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths are checked and SVG content is loaded into the custom_icons dictionary for later use in CSS class generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. Uses standard file reading and string processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages SVG icon loading for a documentation theme, using filesystem checks and embedding SVG content into the environment for CSS styling. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no execution of untrusted input, and no cryptic code. The logic appears to be straightforward and intended for static asset management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate functions related to icon management within a Sphinx theme. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It safely loads SVG icons from specified directories and manages their integration into the documentation build process.",
