  "purpose": "This module adds support for custom icons in Sphinx documentation, including loading SVG files and rendering icon roles in HTML output.",
  "sources": "Path reading from filesystem (Path.exists(), Path.read_text()), environment variables (get_custom_icons, env attributes), user input in role text (self.text).",
  "sinks": "Reading SVG files from specified paths, appending HTML span elements with CSS classes.",
  "flows": "User specifies icon path in role text -> load_svg_into_builder_env reads SVG file -> SVG content stored in custom_icons -> HTML renderer outputs span with classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors or hidden code. The code performs file system reads and HTML generation based on user-defined roles. The role parsing allows injection of class names but no malicious code execution is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages SVG icon loading and role rendering within a Sphinx documentation build. It reads SVG files from user-specified static paths or bundled defaults, caches SVG content, and generates HTML spans with class attributes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system damage. The only potentially risky aspect is that the role input is directly used for class names, but this is standard practice in role-based rendering and does not pose malicious intent. All filesystem interactions are straightforward and controlled, with no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for legitimate functionality—adding icon support in Sphinx documentation—without signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely loads SVG files, caches them, and outputs HTML. No malware or security issues are detected.",
