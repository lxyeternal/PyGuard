  "purpose": "This module adds a custom icon role to Sphinx documentation, supporting SVG icons from specified paths or bundled resources.",
  "sources": "Path inputs from icon_name parameter in load_svg_into_builder_env function, static_paths from 'sphinx_immaterial_icon_path' config, builder.srcdir, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Reading SVG files from disk (via Path.read_text), potential file not found errors, use of Path objects and text reading.",
  "flows": "User specifies icon names and optional classes; load_svg_into_builder_env reads SVG content from filesystem; get_custom_icons caches SVG data; IconsRole generates HTML span elements referencing cached SVG content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code reads files from filesystem based on configurable paths and loads SVG content into memory for later use.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for managing SVG icon data, loading SVG files from user-specified or default directories, and rendering HTML span elements with CSS classes for icons. It utilizes Path for filesystem access, which is standard. The flow involves user-defined icon names, which are sanitized and used to locate SVG files, then cached for reuse. No obfuscated or suspicious code, nor external network activity, is present. The only notable behavior is dynamic filesystem reading based on configuration, which is typical for theme resources. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation for loading and rendering SVG icons in Sphinx documentation. It only reads local SVG files and injects HTML elements, with no suspicious or malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided fragment.",
