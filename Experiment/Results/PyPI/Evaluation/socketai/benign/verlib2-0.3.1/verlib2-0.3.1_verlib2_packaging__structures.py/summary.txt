  "conclusion": "The code serves as utility singleton objects for representing infinity and negative infinity with appropriate comparison semantics. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The implementation is correct for its purpose, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified."
