  "purpose": "Define classes representing positive and negative infinity with comparison operators and hashing methods.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data collection from external sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements classes for representing infinity objects with comparison and hashing methods. These are typical utility classes and do not perform any data manipulation, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. No input/output handling or external data interaction is present. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose, likely for mathematical or logical operations involving infinity values.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining utility classes for infinity representations. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. Overall, it is safe and does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
