{
  "purpose": "Define singleton classes representing positive and negative infinity with comparison and representation methods.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method implementations; no external input or data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is purely class definitions with internal logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to define special singleton objects for infinity representations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for InfinityType and NegativeInfinityType with comparison operators, representation, and hashing. Both classes behave as singleton objects, with comparison logic consistent with infinity semantics. No data input, external communication, or suspicious logic observed. The code appears to serve as a utility for representing infinities in numerical or logical contexts, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of infinity singleton objects for use in larger programs. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. It is safe and purpose-specific.",
