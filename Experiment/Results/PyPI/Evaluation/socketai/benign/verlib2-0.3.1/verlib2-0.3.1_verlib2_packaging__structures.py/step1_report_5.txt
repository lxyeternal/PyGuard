  "purpose": "Defines custom classes for representing positive and negative infinity with comparison behaviors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method implementations within the code.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; methods only operate on class instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, InfinityType and NegativeInfinityType, with methods for representation, hashing, comparison, and negation. The implementation appears to be straightforward, intended for use as sentinel or singleton objects for representing infinity values. There are no input/output operations, external data dependencies, or suspicious behaviors. No indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility classes for representing infinity values. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
