{
  "purpose": "Define custom classes for representing positive and negative infinity with comparison and representation methods.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network transmission, or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling are present; the code solely defines classes with methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, InfinityType and NegativeInfinityType, implementing comparison operators, string representation, hashing, and negation. These are straightforward data structures intended for use as sentinel values for infinity in computations. No external input, output, or malicious logic is present. The methods operate purely on class instances with no interaction with external systems or data. The code appears to be a standard implementation of sentinel objects for representing infinity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely to represent infinity values with comparison behavior. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. It is a simple, well-structured utility code.",
