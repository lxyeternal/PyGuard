{
  "purpose": "Define singleton classes representing positive and negative infinity with comparison, hashing, negation, and string representation methods for use as utility objects in mathematical or logical computations.",
  "sources": "No external data input, environment variables, or data streams; class definitions are self-contained.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code consists solely of class definitions and singleton instances without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Comparison operators (`__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`) are hardcoded to return fixed boolean values, which may not reflect typical comparison semantics but are consistent within singleton utility objects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, `InfinityType` and `NegativeInfinityType`, representing positive and negative infinity respectively. Both classes implement comparison operators, hashing based on their string representations, negation returning the opposite infinity object, and string representations. Singleton instances `Infinity` and `NegativeInfinity` are created for use throughout the codebase. The comparison methods are simplistic, with `Infinity` always comparing greater than any other object and `NegativeInfinity` always less, which aligns with their intended semantic roles as sentinel objects. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, utility-oriented, and free of obfuscation or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as utility singleton objects for representing infinity and negative infinity with appropriate comparison semantics. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The implementation is correct for its purpose, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified.",
