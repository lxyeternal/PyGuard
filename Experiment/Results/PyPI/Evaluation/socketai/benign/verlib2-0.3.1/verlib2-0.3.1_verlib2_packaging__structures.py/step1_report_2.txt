{
  "purpose": "Defines custom classes for representing infinity and negative infinity in Python, with comparison and hashing behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted data sources are used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected. The classes only define comparison, hashing, and representation methods without external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates two classes, InfinityType and NegativeInfinityType, to model infinity and negative infinity with custom comparison logic. Both classes implement standard special methods (__repr__, __hash__, comparison operators, __neg__). There are no data inputs, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a utility for handling infinity representations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as utility classes for representing infinity. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
