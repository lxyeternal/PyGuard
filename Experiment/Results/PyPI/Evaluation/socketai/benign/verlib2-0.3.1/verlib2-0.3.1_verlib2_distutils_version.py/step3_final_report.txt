{
  "purpose": "Provides classes to parse, represent, and compare version numbers in Python, specifically StrictVersion and LooseVersion, using regex and string operations.",
  "sources": "Input version strings provided to parse methods; internal regex matching; class constructors.",
  "sinks": "None; the code operates entirely in-memory without external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into internal representations; comparison methods compare these representations; no external data flows or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no network activity, no data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version classes that parse version strings using regex or string splitting, compare versions via tuple or list comparisons, and issue deprecation warnings. There are no external system calls, network operations, or data leaks. The deprecation warnings are standard and benign. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and implements standard version comparison logic without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of version parsing and comparison classes. No malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The deprecation warnings are benign. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the deprecation warning, which does not constitute a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code and the warning.",
