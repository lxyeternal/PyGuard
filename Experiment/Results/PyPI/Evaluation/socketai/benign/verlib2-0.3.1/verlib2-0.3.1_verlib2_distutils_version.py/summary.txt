  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of version parsing and comparison classes. No malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The deprecation warnings are benign. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the deprecation warning, which does not constitute a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code and the warning."
