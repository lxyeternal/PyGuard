  "purpose": "No purpose can be determined as the code contains only a comment with a linter directive.",
  "sources": "No sources of data input or data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows present due to absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a linter directive comment (# noqa: A005) with no actual code; no anomalies or malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains solely a comment directive to ignore specific linter warning (A005). There is no executable code, data input, or output, thus no source, sink, or flow. The absence of code means there are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is empty apart from a linter directive comment and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or a configuration comment with no active code.",
