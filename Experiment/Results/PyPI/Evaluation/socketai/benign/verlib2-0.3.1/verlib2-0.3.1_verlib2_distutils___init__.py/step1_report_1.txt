  "purpose": "The code appears to be a single comment directive, specifically a 'noqa' comment used to suppress linter warnings for a specific rule (A005).",
  "sources": "No data input or external sources are read; the code consists solely of a comment directive.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present, as the code does not perform any operations or data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are detectable, since the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is only a comment directive with no executable logic. No anomalies or malicious behavior is present. The comment suppresses a specific linter warning but does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line comment that instructs the linter to ignore warning A005. It does not execute any logic or interact with data, making it benign. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The comment is standard practice to suppress specific lint warnings.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only a linter suppression comment with no executable code or malicious behavior. It presents no security risk.",
