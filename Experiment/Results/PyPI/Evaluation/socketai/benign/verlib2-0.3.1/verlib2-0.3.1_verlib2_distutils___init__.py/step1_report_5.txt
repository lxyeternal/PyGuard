  "purpose": "The code appears to be a single comment line intended to suppress a specific linter warning (A005). It does not perform any operational function.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs, as the code contains only a comment directive.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or data flow occurs within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows are present, as the code does not execute any logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a linter suppression comment without any associated code, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single comment line intended for static analysis tools. No operational code, input handling, or data processing is included. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks. The comment might be used to suppress false positives in linting but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign and contains only a linter directive comment. There is no malicious behavior, security risk, or obfuscation present in this minimal code fragment.",
