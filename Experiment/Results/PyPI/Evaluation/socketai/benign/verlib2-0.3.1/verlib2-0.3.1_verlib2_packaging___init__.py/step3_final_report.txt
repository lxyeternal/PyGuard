  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code inputs such as environment variables, network calls, dynamic code execution, hardcoded URLs/IPs.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points, network communication, environment variable access, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via dynamic execution, network requests, or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, hardcoded secrets, dynamic eval/exec, unusual imports, suspicious network targets.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 1 is empty, with no executable content, correctly scored as benign. Report 2 contains straightforward Python code with no suspicious features, matching its low risk score. Report 3 exhibits signs of obfuscation, hardcoded network targets, and dynamic execution, justifying higher malware (0.6), obfuscated (0.75), and risk (0.65) scores. Report 4 has no code, correctly scored as safe. Report 5 shows complex structure and potential dynamic behavior but lacks concrete malicious indicators, warranting low scores. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described code features, with Report 3 being the primary concern due to signs of malicious intent. Static analysis suggests most code is safe, but runtime behavior should be further examined for confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "The assessment aligns with the evidence: benign in Reports 1, 2, 4, and low suspicion in Report 5. Report 3's higher scores are justified by obfuscation and dynamic code indicators. No adjustments are necessary; the scores accurately reflect the analyzed code snippets.",
