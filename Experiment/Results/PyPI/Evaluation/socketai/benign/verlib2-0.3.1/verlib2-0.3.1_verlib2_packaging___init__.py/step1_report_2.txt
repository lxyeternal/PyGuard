  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with functions related to data processing or utility operations. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "sources": "Data sources include function parameters, imported modules, and environment variables (if used). No external input sources are evident from the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be print statements, file writes, network connections, or subprocess calls, but none are explicitly present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs or variables through functions, but no suspicious or external untrusted data flows are observable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. No obfuscation, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions and no complex or suspicious logic. It does not include any external network calls, file manipulations, or system modifications. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms are present. The code structure and syntax are typical of benign utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no signs of obfuscation or harmful intent.",
