  "purpose": "Define package metadata and retrieve version information for the 'verlib2' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata', and version retrieval using 'version(__appname__)', and importing 'Version' from 'verlib2.packaging.version'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'version(__appname__)' as a source, but it is a standard way to retrieve package version; no sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Source: 'version(__appname__)' retrieves package version; sink: assigning to '__version__'. No data flows leading to external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The license comments are standard. No obfuscation or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and attempts to obtain its version number through standard importlib methods. It handles the absence of 'importlib.metadata' by fallback import. The code only performs metadata retrieval and a simple import, all of which are benign. No untrusted input, no network activity, no data leaks, no malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata setup with safe version retrieval. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be a normal, benign component of a Python package.",
