  "purpose": "Define package metadata and version retrieval logic for the verlib2 library.",
  "sources": "Reading the package name (__appname__), importing version information using importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, and handling exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or written to sensitive outputs.",
  "flows": "Package name (__appname__) is used to retrieve version info via 'version' function, with fallback to 'unknown' if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code handles imports and exceptions properly without hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package metadata, imports version info safely, and handles missing packages gracefully. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. It uses standard Python practices for package version management and exception handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation for managing package version information with proper exception handling. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are present.",
