{
  "purpose": "Manage package metadata (__title__, __summary__, __uri__, __author__, __license__, __copyright__) and retrieve version information with fallback mechanisms for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata variables, importing version and PackageNotFoundError, attempting to retrieve package version, importing Version from verlib2.packaging.version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Import statements -> version retrieval -> fallback handling -> import of Version class",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward standard code with proper exception handling and fallback logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package metadata setup with version retrieval. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, handles exceptions properly, and assigns default values when package info is missing. No suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the implementation follows best practices. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata and version retrieval script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
