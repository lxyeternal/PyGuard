{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and version information retrieval for the verlib2 package.",
  "sources": "Retrieving version information via importlib.metadata or fallback to importlib_metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "The version function reads package metadata; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports version information and handles the absence of importlib.metadata with a fallback. It reads package version data and defines package metadata variables. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for package metadata management, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for package version retrieval and metadata definition, with no malicious behavior detected. It appears safe and intentionally designed for package management purposes.",
