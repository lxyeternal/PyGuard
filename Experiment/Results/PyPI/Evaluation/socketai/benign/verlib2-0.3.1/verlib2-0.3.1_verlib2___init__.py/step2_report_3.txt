  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is standard package metadata management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code uses standard practices for version retrieval, with fallback mechanisms, and handles exceptions properly.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal concern, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious patterns or vulnerabilities.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws are evident in the code or the reports.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n  - **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 vs 0) but both are reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no over- or under-scoring appears necessary.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, does not perform any risky operations, and adheres to standard practices.\n- The exception handling is appropriate, and fallback mechanisms are in place.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very low, reasonable risk score given the context; no real security concern)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports.** No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard, benign package metadata script.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The report assessments are accurate and justified. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
