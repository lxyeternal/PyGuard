{
  "purpose": "Define metadata and version information for the verlib2 package, including licensing details and version retrieval logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads package version information using importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, and retrieves author and license metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The package version is obtained from the package metadata and assigned to __version__, with fallback to 'unknown' if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard version retrieval pattern with fallback handling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward package metadata retrieval for version info, with compatibility fallback mechanisms. It includes license and author metadata, but no dynamic execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata setup script with safe and typical behavior. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
