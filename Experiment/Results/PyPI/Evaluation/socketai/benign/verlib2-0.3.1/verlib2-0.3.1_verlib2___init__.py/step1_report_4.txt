  "purpose": "Define metadata and version information for the verlib2 package, and attempt to retrieve the installed package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the version retrieval from importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard version retrieval and metadata definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata, attempts to import version info via importlib.metadata or fallback to importlib_metadata, and sets __version__ accordingly. It imports a local module 'verlib2.packaging.version' without executing any dynamic or risky code. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for package metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package metadata and version management code without any malicious behavior or security issues. It simply manages package metadata and version retrieval in a safe manner.",
