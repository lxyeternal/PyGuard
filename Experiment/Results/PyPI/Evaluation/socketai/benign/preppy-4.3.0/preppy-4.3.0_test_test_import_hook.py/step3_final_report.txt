  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to verify import behavior of specific modules, involving environment setup, cache management, and custom import hooks.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for .pyc files, command-line arguments, sys.path modifications, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Import statements executing module code, function calls within imported modules, and environment manipulations that could influence import behavior.",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks and deletions -> environment setup (directory, sys.path) -> module import -> function invocation within modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom decorator '@fposto' with unknown implementation, repeated cache file deletions, dynamic sys.path and sys.modules manipulation, and custom import hooks via 'preppy'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled import testing with environment manipulations typical in testing frameworks. No network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration is evident. The decorator '@fposto' could modify behavior but lacks evidence of malicious intent. The import and cache clearing patterns are standard for testing, not malicious. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. No suspicious or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite for import behavior with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The only element warranting further review is the unknown decorator '@fposto', but based on current analysis, it does not elevate risk.",
