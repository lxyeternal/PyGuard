  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'preppy' package, handling installation, testing, and distribution tasks.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, subprocess.call for testing commands, filesystem operations for renaming files.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call executes test commands; os.rename and os.remove modify distribution files based on sys.argv inputs.",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs influence subprocess commands and file renaming operations; no external data flows or network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; subprocess calls are used for testing, and file operations are routine.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup, optional testing via subprocess, and distribution file management. It uses standard modules and practices, with command-line argument parsing that could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The subprocess call is limited to testing commands, and file renaming is part of distribution management. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or network activity are detected. The potential security concern is command injection via sys.argv, but in controlled environments, this is typical. The overall behavior is benign and aligns with standard Python packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup and testing utility with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The minor security risk relates to command-line input handling, which is common in such scripts but should be sanitized in untrusted environments. Scores are appropriately low: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.",
