{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup utility for the 'preppy' Python package, handling installation, testing, and wheel distribution processes.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, os and glob for filesystem interactions, subprocess for running test commands, and the imported 'preppy' module for version info.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, command-line arguments and subprocess calls could process untrusted input, but no actual data is being read from external sources or untrusted inputs directly for security risks.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed and used to control testing and distribution steps, but no untrusted data flows into critical security-sensitive functions such as network communication or data storage.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically manipulates sys.argv for testing purposes, renames wheel files based on distribution directory input, and conditionally executes test scripts. There are no suspicious code injections, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The renaming of wheel files appears to be a benign version management step.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages packaging and testing workflows. It imports standard modules and the 'preppy' package for versioning. The command-line parsing and subprocess invocation are straightforward and controlled. The wheel renaming logic checks for specific files and renames them, which could be used for version management but does not exhibit malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, external network access, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not perform any suspicious activities like data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoor creation.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package management utility with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. Its operations are typical for Python packaging workflows, with controlled handling of command-line arguments and filesystem actions. There are no security risks or malware indications present.",
