      "conclusion": "The code is a powerful, flexible Python templating system that relies heavily on dynamic code execution mechanisms. While it does not contain malicious code or obfuscation, its architecture inherently allows execution of arbitrary code from untrusted sources. Proper security controls, input validation, or sandboxing are essential to mitigate these risks in practice."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup and testing utility with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The minor security risk relates to command-line input handling, which is common in such scripts but should be sanitized in untrusted environments. Scores are appropriately low: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for 'preppy' with no malicious intent or activity. The dynamic code execution is confined to controlled tests, posing minimal security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign test runner script with no malicious intent or activity. The only potential security concern is the sys.path modification, which is a common pattern in testing but could be exploited if the environment is compromised. Overall, the code poses a very low security risk, and the reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary unless operating in an untrusted environment where directory contents could be malicious."
