{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive unit test suite for the 'preppy' templating engine, verifying parsing, tokenization, and execution of template constructs using static, controlled inputs.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded template strings within test methods, version info, and 'preppy' module functions; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Internal 'preppy' API calls such as 'getModule', 'run', and 'dump' on controlled data; no external data exfiltration or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within the test functions, passing static strings through parser and execution functions, with outputs compared to expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; no dynamic code execution outside the test environment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite operating solely on static, predefined inputs. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code. All activities are within a controlled testing context, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a controlled test harness for 'preppy', and scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
