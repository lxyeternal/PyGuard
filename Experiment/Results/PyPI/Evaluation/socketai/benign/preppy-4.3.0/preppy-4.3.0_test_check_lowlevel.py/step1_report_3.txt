{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the preppy templating language parser, used for verifying parsing correctness and functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads static source strings in test methods, input parameters for parser functions, and system environment info for version checks.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly processes predefined strings and parameters. No network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input source strings flow into the preppy parser functions, which tokenize and parse them, then compare output to expected results within test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code primarily handles testing with hardcoded test data; no dynamic code execution or external input sources are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive test suite for the preppy parser, utilizing standard unittest patterns, version conditionals, and internal string comparisons. No evidence of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or sabotage. No network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated code. It relies on well-known testing libraries and static test data, with no suspicious external dependencies or dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite designed to verify the correctness of the preppy parser. It contains no malware or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, and the confidence score is high since the code is straightforward and only used for testing purposes.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
