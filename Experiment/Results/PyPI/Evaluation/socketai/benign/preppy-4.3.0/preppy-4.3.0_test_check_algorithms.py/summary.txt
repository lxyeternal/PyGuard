  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for 'preppy' with no malicious intent or activity. The dynamic code execution is confined to controlled tests, posing minimal security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
