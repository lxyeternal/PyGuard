  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or incomplete script with a comment indicating that imports are enabled.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing is present due to the minimal content.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment about enabling imports, with no actual import statements or logic. This could indicate an incomplete or placeholder script, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is essentially a comment indicating that imports are enabled, but no actual import statements or executable code are present. Since there are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and the code is incomplete, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The minimal content suggests it may be a stub or a placeholder for further development.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is an incomplete placeholder with no operational or malicious elements. Based on the current content, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
