  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the corresponding code snippets.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely a comment about enabling imports, with no actual executable code.\n- There are no sources, sinks, data flows, or network activity.\n- The confidence scores vary, but most are high (0.9), reflecting the minimal content.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no malicious activity.\n- The code appears to be placeholder or incomplete snippets, not functional modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code contains only a comment and no executable statements.\n\n### Logical and reasoning review:\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The assessments are accurate: the code is benign, incomplete, and contains no security risks.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores of 0 are appropriate.  \n  The security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of any actual code or behavior.  \n  The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of code complexity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Any adjustments needed?**  \n  The confidence scores for the reports indicating only comments are somewhat high (0.9), which is acceptable given the certainty that no malicious code exists. The lower confidence (0.2) in some reports might reflect uncertainty about whether this is just a placeholder or part of a larger, hidden context. However, based solely on the provided snippets, these are reasonable.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since there is no executable code, no data flow, and only comments, the risk is effectively zero.  \n- The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.  \n- The minimal content and lack of suspicious patterns justify the security risk score of 0.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- No assumptions about hidden code or future code are made, as the snippets are purely comments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code snippets. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the minimal, comment-only code snippets. No changes are necessary.",
