  "anomalies": "The code is solely a comment with no executable or suspicious elements; no anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comment only, with no actual import statements or executable code. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The code does not perform any operations or contain any malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal content indicates a placeholder or incomplete snippet. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign and placeholder nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high, as the code provides no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a comment with no executable or malicious content. The scores are appropriate and reflect the lack of security risks or obfuscation.",
