  "purpose": "Configuration script for setting up documentation build parameters using Sphinx for the 'preppy' project.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules; reads configuration variables; reads files for documentation build.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted data sources or performs data leaks or external network connections.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> sets sys.path -> defines configuration variables -> reads files and directories for documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code activities, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is standard configuration for Sphinx documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file generated by sphinx-quickstart, with standard parameters for extensions, output formats, themes, and project info. It imports sys and os modules solely for path manipulations and configuration purposes. No dynamic execution, network activities, or untrusted input handling is present. The absence of external data sources, network calls, or embedded secrets indicates a lack of malicious intent. The code does not contain obfuscation, malware patterns, or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for documentation generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, safe setup with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
