  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation, setting up project info, themes, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules, sys.path modification, and configuration variables within the script.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no untrusted data processing, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (sys, os) and modifies sys.path for module discovery. It defines various configuration options for Sphinx, including project info, theme, output formats, and extensions. All values are static and intended for documentation setup. No dynamic execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration file with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
