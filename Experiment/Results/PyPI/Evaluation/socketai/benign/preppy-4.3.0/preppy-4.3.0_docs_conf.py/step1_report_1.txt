  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'preppy' project.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys' and 'os'; reads project metadata; reads configuration options for Sphinx and its extensions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to files or performs network operations; no untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "N/A — configuration code primarily sets variables and imports modules; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is standard Sphinx configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no signs of dynamic code execution, external data input, or network activity. It imports standard modules, sets configuration variables, and defines documentation build options. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is purely to configure documentation build settings. There are no obfuscated patterns, and no external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file for documentation generation with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
