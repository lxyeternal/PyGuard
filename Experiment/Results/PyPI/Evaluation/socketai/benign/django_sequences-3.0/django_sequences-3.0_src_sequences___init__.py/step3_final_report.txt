  "purpose": "Manage sequences in a database, providing functions to get last, next, and delete sequence values, supporting multiple database backends.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as sequence_name, initial_value, reset_value, and database connection info; database connection and ORM models.",
  "sinks": "SQL execution via cursor.execute, ORM methods for sequence retrieval and update.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow into SQL queries and ORM calls; table name is quoted for safety; data is fetched and updated through SQL commands and ORM methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting for SQL queries with dynamic table names, mitigated by connection.ops.quote_name; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for sequence management, including parameterized queries and proper quoting of table names, reducing injection risks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of raw SQL with quoting and ORM methods appears safe. The overall structure is clear, with appropriate transaction management and error handling for value resets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are justified by the code's adherence to best practices and lack of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of sequence management in Django, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and well justified. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
