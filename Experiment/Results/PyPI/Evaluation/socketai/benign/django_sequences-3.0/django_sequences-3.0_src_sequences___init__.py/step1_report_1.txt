{
  "purpose": "This code manages sequences in a Django application, providing functions to get, generate, and delete sequence values, supporting multiple database backends.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration from the database connections, executes SQL queries via cursor.execute, and imports models internally.",
  "sinks": "Execution of formatted SQL queries that incorporate table names and parameters, primarily using cursor.execute with formatted SQL strings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (sequence names, values) into SQL query execution via cursor.execute, then results are fetched from database responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting for SQL table names (potential risk if not properly sanitized, but uses connection.ops.quote_name), dynamic SQL queries for upsert operations, and internal import of models. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic detected. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. All SQL commands are standard sequence management operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements sequence management with standard SQL and Django ORM, supporting PostgreSQL and MySQL with appropriate upsert strategies. It uses parameterized queries for data inputs, reducing injection risk. Internal imports are justified due to Django model import constraints. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. The use of dynamic SQL formatting appears safe, assuming the quote_name method is properly implemented to prevent injection. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or cryptomining activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate sequence management utility for Django, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks beyond typical database operations. The implementation follows standard practices, with proper use of parameterized queries and ORM features.",
