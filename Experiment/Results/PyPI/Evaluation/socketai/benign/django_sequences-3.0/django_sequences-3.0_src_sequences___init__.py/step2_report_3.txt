  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes sequence management functions; source is internal database connections and models.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from parameters into SQL execution; proper parameterization is used.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; uses connection.ops.quote_name for table name, which is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, secure, and does not exhibit malicious behavior. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical database operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound; scores align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flow is standard; parameterized queries used.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or malware detected; code is secure.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1 appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; supports multiple backends.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly manages data flow; uses parameterized queries.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses string formatting for SQL, but with quote_name and parameters, mitigating injection risk.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard sequence management.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly describes data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; uses safe quoting.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code is standard and secure.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2 seem justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are standard; proper quoting mitigates injection.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of string formatting for SQL is noted, but safe via quote_name.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; code is typical for sequence management.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting typical database interaction risks, which are justified given the code's operations.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard sequence management with proper use of parameterized queries and quoting.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities beyond normal database interaction concerns.\n- The dynamic SQL formatting, while potentially risky if misused, is mitigated here by quoting table names properly.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (reflects typical database operation risks, justified by proper quoting and parameterization)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is secure, standard, and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.",
