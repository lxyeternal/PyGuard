{
  "purpose": "The code provides database sequence management functions within a Django application, including retrieving, updating, and deleting sequence values in a database-agnostic manner.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as sequence_name, initial_value, reset_value, nowait, and using, which may originate from user inputs or other modules.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to the database through cursor.execute() calls for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, potentially affecting database state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters to database operations via formatted SQL queries; no untrusted external input is directly concatenated into SQL strings, but parameterized queries are used for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The SQL queries appear standard for sequence management. No unusual code patterns are detected. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages sequence values across different database systems (PostgreSQL and MySQL) with proper parameterization in SQL queries, reducing injection risk. The functions use Django's ORM and connection handling appropriately. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs. The logic aligns with typical sequence management patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as system data theft, hidden backdoors, or unauthorized external communication are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured sequence management utility within a Django application. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
