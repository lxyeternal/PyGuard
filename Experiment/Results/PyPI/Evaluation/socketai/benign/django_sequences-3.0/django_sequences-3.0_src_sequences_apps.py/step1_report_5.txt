  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration for the 'sequences' app with localized verbose name.",
  "sources": "Import statements: django.apps and django.utils.translation, class attributes: name and verbose_name",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data output observed",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; configuration is static and predefined",
  "anomalies": "Use of translation function _() for verbose_name is standard for localization, no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with static attributes. It imports necessary modules, uses standard Django patterns, and applies translation for verbose_name. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for Django apps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration class with proper localization; no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
