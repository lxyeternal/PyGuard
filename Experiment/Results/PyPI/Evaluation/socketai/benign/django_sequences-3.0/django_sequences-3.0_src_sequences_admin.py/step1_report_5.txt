  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward Django admin registration code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's admin module and a local models module. It then registers the Sequence model with the admin interface, customizing list display, ordering, and search fields. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is standard Django admin registration, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django admin registration for a model, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a typical configuration snippet with no signs of malicious or maliciously compromised behavior.",
