  "sinks": "Django admin registration and display configuration",
  "flows": "Importing models -> Admin registration -> Admin display configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's admin module and a local models module. It registers the Sequence model with the Django admin site, specifying display fields and search capabilities. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or data manipulations that could indicate malicious behavior. The code follows standard Django patterns for admin configuration and does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward Django admin registration script for a model named Sequence. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard boilerplate code for admin interface setup.",
