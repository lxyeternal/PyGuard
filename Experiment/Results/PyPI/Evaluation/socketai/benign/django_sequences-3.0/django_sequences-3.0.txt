      "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately score the dependency's security posture. The only notable point is the cautious low risk assigned to Report 1 due to 'exec' usage, which is justified given the lack of concrete malicious evidence. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, with no indications of sabotage or malware."

The scores should reflect a safe status with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1)."
