{
  "purpose": "Define a Django model named 'Sequence' with fields for name and last value, representing a sequence object in a database.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; data is stored in the database via model instances.",
  "sinks": "Database save operations; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Model field definitions and class methods manage data storage; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The use of translation functions is standard for internationalization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model with two fields: 'name' (a primary key CharField with translation support) and 'last' (a positive integer). It includes a string representation method. No input/output handling or external data processing is present. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward Django model implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django ORM model with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It primarily manages database records for sequences and does not contain any malicious logic or security vulnerabilities.",
