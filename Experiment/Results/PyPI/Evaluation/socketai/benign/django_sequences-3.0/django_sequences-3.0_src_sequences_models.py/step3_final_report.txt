  "purpose": "Defines a Django model 'Sequence' with a name and last value for sequence management.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static model fields.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely ORM model definition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard Django model with translation utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django ORM model with two fields: 'name' as primary key and 'last' as a positive integer. It uses standard practices, including translation functions. No external data handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely declarative, managing database schema without any input/output or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and secure. No malicious intent or security issues are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
