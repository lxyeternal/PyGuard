  "sources": "No identifiable sources or data inputs are present in the code; the script does not read from files, network, environment variables, or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network connections, file writes, environment modifications, or system commands that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within the code; there are no source-to-sink paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code is either empty or contains no executable statements, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual constructs. Lack of content itself is not anomalous but indicates absence of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is essentially empty or minimal without any operations, inputs, or outputs. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security issues. The absence of code prevents any malicious or insecure behavior from occurring.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears benign or non-existent, with no evident malicious activity.",
