  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately score the dependency's security posture. The only notable point is the cautious low risk assigned to Report 1 due to 'exec' usage, which is justified given the lack of concrete malicious evidence. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, with no indications of sabotage or malware."
