  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are detectable due to absence of code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code structures, or suspicious activities are observed, likely because no code was provided.",
  "analysis": "Since no code fragment is supplied, a detailed analysis cannot be performed. The review relies on the presence of actual code to identify security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies. The current input lacks any executable or reviewable code, resulting in a neutral assessment.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review; therefore, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be identified. The review is inconclusive due to absence of code.",
