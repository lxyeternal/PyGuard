  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and possibly network communication, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from environment variables, user input functions, or file reads (if present). No explicit sources identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (e.g., requests or socket operations), file writes, or subprocess executions, if present. No explicit sinks are evident from the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) to sinks (if any), through processing functions. No clear flow paths are explicitly detailed in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL domains, or unusual dynamic code execution are detected. The code does not contain obfuscated segments or uncommon language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing and possibly network communication, but without obvious malicious patterns or obfuscation. There are no indicators of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical and does not show signs of malicious intent. Due to limited context and absence of suspicious code patterns, no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose, though the lack of detailed context limits full assessment.",
