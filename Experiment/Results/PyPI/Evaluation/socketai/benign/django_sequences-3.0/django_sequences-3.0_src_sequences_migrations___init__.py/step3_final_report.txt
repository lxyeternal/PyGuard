  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input reading points such as function parameters, environment variables, file reads, network requests, or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Paths from sources to sinks, especially where untrusted input influences sensitive operations or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution (e.g., 'exec'), obfuscation, unusual variable names, or code patterns indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains minimal or no content in most reports, with only Report 1 mentioning 'exec' without evidence of malicious activity. Scores are consistent with the content: malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and low security risk (0.2), reflecting cautiousness due to 'exec'. For reports with no code, scores are appropriately zero. The overall assessment indicates low supply chain risk, with the primary concern being cautious handling of dynamic code execution in Report 1. No evidence of sabotage or malware is present, and the scoring aligns with the described content.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately score the dependency's security posture. The only notable point is the cautious low risk assigned to Report 1 due to 'exec' usage, which is justified given the lack of concrete malicious evidence. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
