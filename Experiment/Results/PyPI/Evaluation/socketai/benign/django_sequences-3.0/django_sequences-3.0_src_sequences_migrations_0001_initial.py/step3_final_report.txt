  "purpose": "Create a Django migration model for tracking sequences with a name and last value.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a model schema for database migration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only sets up database schema without data processing.",
  "flows": "The code flows from model definition to database schema creation; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for Django migrations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Django migration creating a 'Sequence' model with 'name' as primary key and 'last' as a positive integer. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports provided are empty and contain only 'Empty response' messages, offering no additional information or concerns. The code's intent appears benign, and there are no signs of malicious activity or security issues. Given the lack of evidence, the malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the overall security risk minimal. The reports do not indicate any problems, and the code is standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django migration script with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not provide any evidence of issues. The scores should reflect a safe status with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
