  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard visualization classes for decision trees, with optional dependencies handled via fallback classes.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No external network calls; file handling is straightforward.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Regex usage is benign, serving formatting purposes.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, justified by dependency handling and regex usage)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar visualization/export functions, with optional dependencies.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No external network activity; regex is used for formatting, which is standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The regex manipulation is benign.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low, justified)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Exporting decision trees with support for multiple formats; reads from model attributes and optional files.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No external network calls; regex is used for output formatting, not malicious injection.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; safe handling of dependencies; regex is benign.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (justified, low risk)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Visualization/export classes for decision trees; optional dependencies handled gracefully.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No network activity; regex is used internally for text formatting.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code is a visualization utility with safe practices.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (justified)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others—decision tree visualization/export with optional dependencies.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No network calls; regex for formatting, not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Low, justified by dependency handling, regex usage for formatting, and the absence of external data leaks or malicious behavior. Slightly higher risk (around 0.2) in some reports is reasonable given the regex manipulations, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all, as no malicious actions are detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is clear and well-structured.  \n- **Risk:** Given the consistent benign nature, a score of about **0.1 to 0.2** seems appropriate, aligning with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior. The code is a standard, well-structured visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2\n\nThis reflects a benign, safe utility for decision tree visualization.",
