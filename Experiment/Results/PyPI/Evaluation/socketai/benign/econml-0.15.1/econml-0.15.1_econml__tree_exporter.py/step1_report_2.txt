{
  "purpose": "The code provides various classes and functions for exporting, visualizing, and customizing decision trees, including support for MPL, DOT, and graphviz formats, primarily for interpretability of models.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (abc, numpy, re, io) and scikit-learn utilities, as well as optional imports of matplotlib and graphviz modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses file objects or strings for exporting visualizations; writes to files or StringIO; manipulates text with regex for node descriptions.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> initializes exporter classes -> methods generate visualizations or export files -> potentially write output to files/strings.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports of optional modules that raise custom exceptions; regex manipulation in node_to_str methods which could be misused for obfuscation or malicious injection if the replacement text is controlled externally (though unlikely in this context). No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; no external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for exporting decision trees in different formats with customizable features such as titles and labels. It uses standard patterns for file handling and exporting, with no indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity. The regex used for node string replacements is benign and intended for formatting purposes. Optional imports are handled safely with exception catching and custom exception raising. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or covert data transmissions are present. The code appears to be purely for visualization and interpretability of decision trees.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of visualization and export classes for decision trees, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. It handles file output and text formatting safely, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
