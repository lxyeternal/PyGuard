{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for exporting and visualizing decision trees and CATE trees in various formats (matplotlib, graphviz, dot), supporting optional dependencies with fallback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Reads model attributes, optional module imports, and internal formatting strings; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to files or strings; uses regex for internal text formatting; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Source data (model attributes, internal formatting) flows into output functions; regex manipulations are for formatting purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for substituting node text, but only for internal formatting; fallback imports for optional modules are standard; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of visualization utilities for decision trees, handling optional dependencies safely, with internal regex used for formatting. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The regex is benign, serving only presentation formatting. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard visualization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility for decision trees with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The risk score is also low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to internal regex formatting and dependency handling.",
