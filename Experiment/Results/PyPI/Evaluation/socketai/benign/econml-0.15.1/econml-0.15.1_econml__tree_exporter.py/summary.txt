  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility for decision trees with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The risk score is also low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to internal regex formatting and dependency handling."
