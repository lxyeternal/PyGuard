{
  "purpose": "The code provides abstract base classes and mixins for causal effect estimators, focusing on effect calculation, inference, treatment handling, and interpretability tools like SHAP. It facilitates flexible, extensible causal modeling frameworks.",
  "sources": "Inputs such as Y, T, X flow into model attributes and inference methods; outputs include inference results, summaries, and explanations. No external system calls or network operations are evident.",
  "sinks": "Data flows are contained within the modeling pipeline; no external data exfiltration, system modifications, or malicious system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data from inputs (Y, T, X) are processed through model attributes and inference objects; outputs are inference results, summaries, and explanations, all within the code's internal scope.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls are detected. The code relies on standard libraries and internal modules without malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard, well-structured framework for causal inference, with clear data handling and no signs of malicious behavior. It uses common design patterns, with data flows confined within the application. External inference modules are used but do not contain embedded malicious code. No obfuscation, secrets, or sabotage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of causal effect estimation classes. No malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk 0.",
