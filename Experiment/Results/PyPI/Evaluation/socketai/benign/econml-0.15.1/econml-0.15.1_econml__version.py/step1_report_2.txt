  "purpose": "The code snippet provides license information and versioning details for a Python package.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs; it only contains comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments indicating licensing and version, along with a variable assignment for __version__. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or external interactions that could pose security risks. It appears to be boilerplate or metadata for a Python package.\n\nThere are no sources, sinks, or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present.\n\nOverall, this is a simple, benign fragment with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata snippet with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as package metadata and does not pose any threat.",
