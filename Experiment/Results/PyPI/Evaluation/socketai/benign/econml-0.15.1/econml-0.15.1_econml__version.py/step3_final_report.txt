  "purpose": "This code defines a version string for a Python package and includes licensing comments, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with only comments and a variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. It is typical package metadata. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external data or network activity indicate a benign purpose. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, and confidence is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as standard package metadata with no security or malicious concerns. The current scores accurately reflect its safety, and no modifications are necessary.",
