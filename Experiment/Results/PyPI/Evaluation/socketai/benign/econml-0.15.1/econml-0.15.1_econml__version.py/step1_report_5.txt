  "purpose": "The code provides metadata for a Python package, specifically defining its version number.",
  "sources": "The source is the assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "The flow is simply assigning a static string to a variable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting a version variable for a package. It does not include any input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The only content is a comment and a straightforward variable assignment, typical for package metadata. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
