{
  "purpose": "This script configures and builds Python C extensions using setuptools and Cython, handling source files and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local file; globbing for .pyx and .c files in the project directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> collects source files -> configures extensions -> invokes setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building extensions, relying solely on static files and well-known build tools. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. All operations are filesystem-based and straightforward. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe build configuration with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate and accurate. External malicious files could pose a risk but are outside the scope of this script. Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
