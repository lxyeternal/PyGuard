  "purpose": "Configure setup for building a Python package with Cython extensions and C extensions, including version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from a file, scans for .pyx and .c files in the directory structure.",
  "sinks": "Uses glob and file reading functions; no untrusted data sources or outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> determines files to compile -> sets up extensions for build process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads version info from a file, searches for Cython and C source files, and prepares extension modules accordingly. The process relies solely on static file listing and standard library functions, with no indications of malicious behavior. No data leaks, external communications, or suspicious code are present. The only potential concern could be if malicious files are present in the source directories, but this cannot be determined from the script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for building extensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content.",
