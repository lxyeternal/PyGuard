{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for building Python extension modules, including Cython extensions, using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from a local file, globbing for .pyx and .c files, and importing modules (setuptools, numpy, re, glob, os).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks data. File system operations are standard and safe in this context.",
  "flows": "Read version file -> gather source files -> determine which files to compile -> configure extensions -> setup build process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version number from a local file, gathers source files for extensions, and configures build extensions with Cython and setuptools. The globbing and file handling are standard, with no dynamic code execution or external data sources involved. It relies on static project files and standard library modules. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for building Python Cython extensions. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and intended solely for package setup.",
