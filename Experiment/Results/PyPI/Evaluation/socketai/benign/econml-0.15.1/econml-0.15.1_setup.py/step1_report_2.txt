  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and installing a Python package with optional Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from a file, scans for .pyx and .c files in the 'econml' directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> scans filesystem for source files -> configures extensions -> calls setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the package version from a local file, scans for source files (.pyx and .c) in the 'econml' directory, and configures Cython extensions accordingly. It conditionally uses cythonize only if .pyx files exist. The setup() function is called with the prepared extension modules. No external inputs or untrusted data are used in a way that could lead to security issues. The code relies on local filesystem data and standard build tools, with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for compiling a Python package with Cython extensions. It performs file scans and setup configuration without any malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
