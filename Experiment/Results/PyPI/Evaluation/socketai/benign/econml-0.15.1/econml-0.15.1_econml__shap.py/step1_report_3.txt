  "purpose": "Helper functions for explaining model predictions using SHAP values in treatment effect estimation contexts.",
  "sources": "Imports 'inspect', 'shap', 'collections.defaultdict', 'numpy', and a local utilities module; uses input parameters and dataset features.",
  "sinks": "SHAP explainer objects and explanation outputs, which could potentially leak data if misused; no explicit data exfiltration or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input datasets to model explanation functions; explanations are generated via SHAP explainer objects, with intermediate data stored in explanation objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variables detected. The code is mainly standard explanation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for model explanation using SHAP, including handling different types of models and scenarios. It relies on external 'shap' library to generate explanations, which could potentially be misused if the explanations are exported or transmitted improperly. No network connections, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions do not include any obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behaviors; they are typical explanation utilities for model interpretability. The code does handle potentially exception-raising code when creating SHAP explainers, but this is standard practice and not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate, intended for model explanation tasks without any malicious intent or dangerous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for explaining model predictions with SHAP in a treatment effect modeling context. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious operations. It is standard for explainability purposes and does not pose supply chain security risks.",
