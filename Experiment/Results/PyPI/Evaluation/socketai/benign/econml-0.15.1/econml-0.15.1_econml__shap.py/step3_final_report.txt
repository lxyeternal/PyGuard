{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions to generate SHAP explanations for causal effect models, supporting various model types and scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (X), model outputs, and model objects; utilizes local data and model functions; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Stores explanation objects in nested dictionaries; no data leaks, network connections, or external file writes detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X through model functions to SHAP explainers, producing explanation objects stored locally; no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard SHAP API usage with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. It processes data locally, generates explanations, and manages data structures securely. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external communication are present. The functions are designed for interpretability, not malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of SHAP explanation utilities for causal models. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate, reflecting minimal potential for explanation data misuse but no active threat.",
