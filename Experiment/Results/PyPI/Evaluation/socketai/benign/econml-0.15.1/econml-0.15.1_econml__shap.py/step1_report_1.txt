  "purpose": "Helper functions to generate SHAP explanations for various causal effect models and estimators in machine learning, primarily for interpretability of treatment effect models.",
  "sources": "Reads include input data X, model objects, and optional featurizer transformations. Also reads shape of datasets and model attributes during explanation.",
  "sinks": "Uses SHAP explainer objects to generate explanation data; no apparent data leaks or external network communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X through model predictions to SHAP explanations, with optional transformations. Explanations are stored in nested dictionaries indexed by treatment and output names.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected. All functions are standard explanation utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for generating SHAP explanations of causal models, including support for different model types and multitask models. It performs data handling, model wrapping, and explanation generation in a structured manner. No code executes external commands, network requests, or manipulates sensitive data improperly. Helper function '_define_names' handles name parsing, and model explanation functions use try-except blocks to fallback on alternative explanation methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection. Usage of SHAP's API appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a set of standard, legitimate model explanation utilities for interpretability purposes. No malicious or sabotage elements are identified. It is designed to generate SHAP explanations securely and transparently for causal effect models. The overall security risk is very low.",
