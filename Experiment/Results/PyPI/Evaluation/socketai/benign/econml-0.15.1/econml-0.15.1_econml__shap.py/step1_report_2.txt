  "purpose": "Helper functions to generate SHAP explanations for causal effect estimators in machine learning models, focusing on interpretability of treatment effects.",
  "sources": "Import statements, utility functions, and SHAP explanation functions operating on model predictions and input data.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data X flows into SHAP explainers, which generate explanations. Model predictions are explained via SHAP. No external data flows or data leaks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be standard explanatory utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for interpreting machine learning models using SHAP, including handling different model types and treatment scenarios. It employs standard SHAP usage patterns, with no signs of data exfiltration, malicious control flow, or hidden backdoors. The imports are standard libraries (inspect, shap, numpy) and local utilities, with no network or file I/O. The functions operate on provided model objects and data, returning explanation objects. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SHAP explanations for treatment effect models. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage features. The code's purpose is for model interpretability, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
