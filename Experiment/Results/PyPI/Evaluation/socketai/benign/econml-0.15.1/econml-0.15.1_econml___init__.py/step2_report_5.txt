  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` or module setup script, defining `__all__` and importing `__version__`.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining the API and importing version info.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; code sets `__all__` and imports `__version__`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on package metadata.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard module declaration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence but still consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches all reports' descriptions; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, but in this case, 0 is justified given the benign code.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary.\n- The scores are appropriate; no report overstates or understates risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, **the malware score should remain at 0**, the obfuscated score at 0, and the overall risk at 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
