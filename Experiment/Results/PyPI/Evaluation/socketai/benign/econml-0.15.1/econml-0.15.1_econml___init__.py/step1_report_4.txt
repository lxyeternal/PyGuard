{
  "purpose": "Define public API exports and import version information for a Python package related to machine learning and statistical methods.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; only package metadata and import statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external sinks observed.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from input to sink pathways evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, mainly declaration and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the __all__ list to specify exported symbols for the package, which is a common practice for Python modules. It also imports the __version__ attribute from a local module. There are no suspicious patterns such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The code appears standard and benign, serving as part of a package's initialization or metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup for a Python package, defining exported symbols and importing version info. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
