{
  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ list for module exports and imports a version identifier, likely as part of a larger Python package for machine learning or data analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ from a local module (_version). It also reads the list of exported symbols (__all__).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or process untrusted data directly. It only imports a version string from a local module and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing __version__ from a local module, which is a controlled operation, and defining a list of exported names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code are present. The import of __version__ appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list of module export names (__all__) and imports a version identifier from a local module. Both actions are typical for a Python package initialization or module file. No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns are present. The code does not handle external inputs, perform network operations, or manipulate sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module declaration file with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified. It appears to be a standard part of a Python package setup.",
