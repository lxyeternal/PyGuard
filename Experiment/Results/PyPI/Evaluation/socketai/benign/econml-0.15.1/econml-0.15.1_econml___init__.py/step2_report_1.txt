  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward __init__.py-like file, defining __all__ and importing __version__ from a local module. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign, standard package setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, very standard package metadata code with no anomalies.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues identified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical module declaration with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—defining __all__, importing __version__, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard package initialization code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Code content:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard, benign package initialization script.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; all scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all scores are 0.\n- **Security risk:** None detected; all scores are 0.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` or package metadata setup, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- Given the code's simplicity and the lack of any suspicious elements, I agree with the assessments.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
