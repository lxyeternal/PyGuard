{
  "purpose": "The code defines the public API for a Python package by specifying the __all__ list and importing the version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable from a local module ._version.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The __version__ is imported from a local module; no data flows from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; straightforward package metadata setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a standard __all__ declaration listing module components, and a simple import of __version__ from a local module. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs are present. The structure aligns with typical package __init__.py files, establishing public API and version info. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated content. It is a standard package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, benign part of a Python package setup, serving to define public API and version information without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
