{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization script, defining the public API via __all__ and importing the package version from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module ._version to import __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the import of __version__ to the module namespace; no external data flows or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward package setup with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py-like script that defines __all__ and imports __version__, typical for package metadata. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and clarity support high confidence in its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
