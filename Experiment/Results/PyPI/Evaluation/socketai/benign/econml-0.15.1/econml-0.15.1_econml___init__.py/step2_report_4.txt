  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-checkting their conclusions with the code, and assessing their scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Overall Code Context:**\nThe provided code is a minimal, straightforward __init__.py or module setup script. It defines an __all__ list of exported symbols and imports a version string from a local module. There are no data flows, no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The code is standard for package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as defining the public API and importing version info.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is standard, benign, and typical.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, standard package setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, focusing on package metadata.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, package API declaration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (still high)\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Are there any issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is a standard package initialization script, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are the malware scores appropriate?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Are the risk scores reasonable?**  \n  All are 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n- **Any anomalies or assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward.\n\n- **Are the confidence levels justified?**  \n  Yes, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are consistent, and their reasoning aligns with the code. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign package initialization snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided assessments are accurate, and I concur with the low scores assigned.",
