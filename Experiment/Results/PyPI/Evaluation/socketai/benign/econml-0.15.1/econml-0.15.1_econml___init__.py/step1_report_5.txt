{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public API for a Python package, listing modules and components available for import, and importing version information.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading detected; no user input or untrusted data handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or harm, as the code only defines module exports and imports version info.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up exports and imports version info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The code structure is standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ to specify exported symbols for the package, listing various modules and components. It imports __version__ from a local module, likely for package version tracking. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no network operations, or other suspicious activity. It appears to be a typical package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely manages package exports and version import, indicating low risk.",
