  "purpose": "The code defines the public API of a Python package by specifying exported symbols and imports the version information.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; it primarily sets package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be leaked or cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes module exports and imports version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard package initialization code, setting __all__ for exports and importing version info. It does not include any dynamic code execution, data handling, or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal, benign package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
