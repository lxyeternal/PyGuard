  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines `__all__` and imports `__version__` from a local module, typical for package `__init__.py`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. The confidence is high (1), and all scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are 0.\n- **Assessment:** This is a benign, standard package initialization code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard setup of `__all__` and version import.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or data flows.\n- **Scores:** All zero, high confidence (1).\n- **Assessment:** Also benign, typical package metadata setup.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on defining `__all__` and importing `__version__`.\n- No suspicious code, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** All zero, high confidence (1).\n- **Assessment:** Standard, safe code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar observations: setting `__all__`, importing `__version__`.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zero, high confidence (1).\n- **Assessment:** Typical package setup.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: defining `__all__`, importing version info.\n- No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still very high.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Assessment:** Standard, benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same code snippet, which is a straightforward package initialization file.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All reports assign zero scores, indicating no malicious or obfuscated behavior detected.\n- **Logical flaws or mistakes:** None apparent; the code is standard for Python package setup.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:** The code is very simple, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. The consistent findings across all reports support that this is a benign, normal package initialization script.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
