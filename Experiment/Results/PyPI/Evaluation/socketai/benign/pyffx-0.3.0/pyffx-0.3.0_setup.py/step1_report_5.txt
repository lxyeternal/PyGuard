  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyffx Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; defining package metadata; specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data processing occurs; no user input handling or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading README file into description variable, then into setup configuration; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; standard setup.py pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and reads a README file to set package description. It then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no network calls, no data leaks, or untrusted data flows. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are present. The code follows typical Python packaging conventions and contains no suspicious behaviors or malicious intents.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
