  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the pyffx Python module, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; importing setuptools and sys modules; defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "Reading README.rst (source) into description variable, then passing static parameters to setup() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. Usage of standard setup process.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a documentation file for description content and then calls setup() with static, predefined parameters. It does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or data handling from untrusted sources. All dependencies and metadata are explicitly defined and static. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is benign and typical for Python package distribution.",
