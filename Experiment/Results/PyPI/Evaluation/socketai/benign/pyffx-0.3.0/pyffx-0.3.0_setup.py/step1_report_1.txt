{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyffx', specifying its metadata, dependencies, and packaging details.",
  "sources": "Read operation on 'README.rst' file, and static data within the setup() function (package name, URL, version, author, description, dependencies, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or external data flows are apparent.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README file and passes static package configuration data directly to setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard setup procedures with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file with specified encoding, and calls setup() with hardcoded, static metadata and dependencies. All data is controlled and static; there are no signs of input handling, data leaks, or malicious actions. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no anomalies. It appears safe and standard.",
