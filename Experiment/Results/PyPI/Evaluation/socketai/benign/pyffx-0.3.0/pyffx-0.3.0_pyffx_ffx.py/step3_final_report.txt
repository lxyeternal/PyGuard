{
  "purpose": "Implements a symmetric, Feistel-like encryption scheme based on HMAC and hashing functions, designed for reversible data transformation.",
  "sources": "Key input used in HMAC, data split into halves for processing, hash digest computations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Key flows into HMAC during each round; data splits into halves; round functions generate pseudo-random values; data is processed through add/sub operations in rounds.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Feistel structure with HMAC-based round functions, using hashlib and hmac libraries. It does not contain network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The use of SHA1 as default digest is outdated but not malicious. The logic is straightforward, with clear data flow from source (key, input data) through cryptographic rounds to output. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The cryptographic design is custom and may have security weaknesses due to SHA1, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility implementing a Feistel network with HMAC, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to the use of SHA1. Overall, it appears to be a standard, non-malicious cryptographic implementation with a minor security weakness.",
