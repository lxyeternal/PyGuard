{
  "purpose": "Implement a reversible Feistel-like encryption scheme using HMAC and hashing functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as key, rounds, and data v; internal methods using hashlib, hmac, struct, and math modules.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks, network transmission, or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encryption/decryption functions; key and internal hash computations process data internally without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard cryptographic utility implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a symmetric encryption algorithm using a Feistel structure with HMAC-based round functions. It uses standard Python libraries (hashlib, hmac, struct, math) without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network access, or system manipulation are present. The cryptographic methods appear standard and do not contain evident backdoors or hardcoded credentials. The logic is consistent with typical cryptographic design, and no suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a symmetric encryption scheme based on a Feistel network, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility with no hidden malicious intent.",
