  "purpose": "Implementation of a Feistel-like encryption algorithm with custom rounds and hashing.",
  "sources": "Key input during initialization; no external data input sources; internal constants and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output; no external data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Key and data flow through the add/sub methods, round function (HMAC computation), and encrypt/decrypt routines.",
  "anomalies": "Use of HMAC with predictable structure; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code; standard cryptographic primitives; no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cryptographic class 'FFX' implementing an encryption scheme using HMAC and modular addition/subtraction, with configurable rounds and digest method. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The HMAC is used for key-dependent pseudo-randomness, typical for such schemes. The implementation appears to be a standard custom encryption routine with no signs of malicious activity. No external network, file access, or system manipulation code detected. The code structure and logic are consistent with a cryptographic utility, not malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, custom cryptographic implementation without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are evident.",
