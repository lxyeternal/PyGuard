{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) based on a Feistel network structure, utilizing HMAC and hashing functions for cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "The class reads the 'key', 'rounds', and 'digestmod' parameters during initialization; the 'key' is used in HMAC computations within the 'round' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'key' is used in HMAC, which influences the encryption process; no other untrusted data sources or outputs are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input data 'v' flows through the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, which invoke 'add', 'sub', and 'round' functions; 'key' flows into HMAC computations in the 'round' method, affecting the cryptographic output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain calls, or network activity; use of standard libraries (hashlib, hmac, struct, math) appears typical; no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a cryptographic implementation of format-preserving encryption using a Feistel network. It employs HMAC with a user-supplied key and standard hashing. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The key is used solely within cryptographic functions, with no hardcoded secrets. The code structure appears standard for cryptographic operations, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a cryptographic function (FPE) without any malicious behavior or suspicious features. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The implementation appears legitimate for its intended purpose.",
