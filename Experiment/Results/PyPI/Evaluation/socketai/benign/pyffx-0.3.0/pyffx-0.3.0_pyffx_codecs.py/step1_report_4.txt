{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for encrypting and decrypting sequences, strings, and integers using a format-preserving encryption scheme with the pyffx library.",
  "sources": "Input data is read in methods like encrypt() and decrypt(), primarily via the pack() methods which process sequences, strings, or integers.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted or decrypted output is returned by encrypt() and decrypt() functions; no external sinks such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to pack() methods, then through self.ffx.encrypt or decrypt, and back through unpack() to produce output.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. Uses well-defined classes and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of classes for format-preserving encryption using the pyffx library. It includes proper use of abstract base classes, method overrides, and safe handling of sequences, strings, and integers. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The encryption relies on the pyffx library, which is a standard tool for such operations. No external or hidden network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The code structure is clear and focused solely on encryption logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for secure data encoding. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet.",
