{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for format-preserving encryption and encoding of sequences, strings, and integers using the pyffx library, facilitating secure data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to pack() methods; external data processed through encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted or decrypted data returned; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> pack() -> encrypt() -> unpack() -> output; or input -> pack() -> decrypt() -> unpack() -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices with pyffx for format-preserving encryption. Data validation in pack/unpack methods is correct. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The structure is clear, and the logic aligns with typical encryption utilities. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of format-preserving encryption classes, with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The security posture is low risk, and the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
