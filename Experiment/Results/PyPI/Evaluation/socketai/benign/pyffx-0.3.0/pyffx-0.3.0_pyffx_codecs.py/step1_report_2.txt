{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for encoding, encrypting, and decrypting sequences, strings, and integers using a format-preserving encryption library (pyffx). It appears intended for secure data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read via method parameters such as 'v' in encrypt/decrypt methods, and sequence/string/integer values provided to class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted/decrypted output returned by encrypt/decrypt methods; no data is written externally within the code.",
  "flows": "Input data (v) flows from method input through packing and encryption, then unpacking and returning; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The classes use standard libraries and a third-party encryption library in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code provides format-preserving encryption for sequences, strings, and integers using the pyffx library. It handles data packing/unpacking, ensures alphabet adherence, and manages sequence lengths with validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. No external data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden code present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of format-preserving encryption classes intended for secure data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of encryption classes with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. It focuses on data transformation using a reputable library without any suspicious or harmful features.",
