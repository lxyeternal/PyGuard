{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes for encoding and encrypting sequences, strings, and integers using a format-preserving encryption method via the pyffx library.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from method parameters such as 'v' in encrypt/decrypt, and class initialization parameters like 'ffx', 'alphabet', and 'length'.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted or decrypted output returned by encrypt/decrypt functions; data processing occurs within class methods.",
  "flows": "Input 'v' flows through pack() methods, then through self.ffx.encrypt() or self.ffx.decrypt(), then through unpack() methods, returning the result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code present. Usage of standard libraries. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of classes for format-preserving encryption, with input validation and error handling. The FFX class from pyffx is used for encryption, which is a standard library for format-preserving encryption. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present. No data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors are evident. The code performs legitimate encryption operations on sequences, strings, and integers, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of format-preserving encryption classes without any malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and methods appropriately, with no anomalies or suspicious features.",
