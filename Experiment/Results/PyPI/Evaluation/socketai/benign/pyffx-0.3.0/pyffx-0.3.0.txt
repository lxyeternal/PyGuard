      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility implementing a Feistel network with HMAC, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to the use of SHA1. Overall, it appears to be a standard, non-malicious cryptographic implementation with a minor security weakness."
