{
  "purpose": "Import necessary classes and functions from the pyffx library, likely for encryption or encoding tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from the pyffx package (`pyffx.codecs` and `pyffx.ffx`).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external outputs within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in the provided snippet; only imports and version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only involves library imports and a version string; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes related to encoding/decoding and encryption from the pyffx library, which is used for format-preserving encryption. The only other element is a version string declaration. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks present. No code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs in this snippet. Given the minimal content, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The imports are from a legitimate open-source library focused on cryptography, and no other suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import and version declaration snippet with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger project that uses pyffx for encoding or encryption purposes. There are no anomalies or security concerns based on this fragment.",
