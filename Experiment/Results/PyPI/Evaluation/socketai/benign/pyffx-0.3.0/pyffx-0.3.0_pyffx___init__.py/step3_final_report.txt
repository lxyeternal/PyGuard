{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from the 'pyffx' cryptography library and sets a version string, likely as part of a larger cryptographic or encryption module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pyffx.codecs' and 'pyffx.ffx' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing, input/output, or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports cryptographic classes and sets a version string, with no data handling, network activity, or malicious code. The imports are from a legitimate open-source library used for format-preserving encryption. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and minimal nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
