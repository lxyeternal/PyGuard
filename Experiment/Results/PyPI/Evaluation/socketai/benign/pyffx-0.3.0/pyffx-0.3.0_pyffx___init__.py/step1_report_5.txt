  "purpose": "Import necessary classes from the pyffx library, likely for encryption or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pyffx library modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this snippet since it only contains import statements and version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code only imports modules and defines a version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the pyffx library, which is known for format-preserving encryption. No data processing, input handling, or execution logic is present. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious constructs are detected. The __version__ string indicates versioning but does not suggest malicious intent. The minimal code is safe and standard for setting up dependencies.\n\nSince this snippet only contains import statements and a version declaration, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import and version declaration with no malicious or suspicious activity. It appears to be part of a larger project setup, with no immediate security concerns.",
