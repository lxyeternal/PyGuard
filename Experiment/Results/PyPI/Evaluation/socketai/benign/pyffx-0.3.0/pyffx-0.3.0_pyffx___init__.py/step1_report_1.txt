{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from the 'pyffx' library, likely for data encryption or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pyffx.codecs' and 'pyffx.ffx' modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file, or database operations present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only imports and a version string; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports components from a known library, 'pyffx', and sets a version string. No input handling, data processing, or other logic is present. Without additional context or further code, there are no signs of malicious intent or malware. The imports are standard for the library's usage, and the version string is typical. No anomalies such as obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module that prepares to use the 'pyffx' library for encryption or obfuscation tasks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
