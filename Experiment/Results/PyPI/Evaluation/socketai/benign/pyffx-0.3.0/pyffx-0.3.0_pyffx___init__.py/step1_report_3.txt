{
  "purpose": "Import necessary classes from the pyffx library for encryption/decryption functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from pyffx.codecs and pyffx.ffx modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing beyond module importation.",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from the pyffx package and sets a version string. There is no data input, processing, or network activity. The imported modules relate to cryptographic functions, but their mere importation does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as an import statement for cryptographic functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
