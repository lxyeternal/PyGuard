  "purpose": "Unit tests for the pyffx library's String and Integer encryption classes.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of String and Integer objects, calls to their encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods encrypt() and decrypt() that process data, but only within controlled test inputs.",
  "flows": "Input data (test strings and numbers) flow into encrypt(), then decrypted back, verifying correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; use of test data is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit tests on the pyffx library's encryption classes. It verifies correct encryption/decryption for strings and integers. The tests involve only benign, controlled input values. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are observed. The code strictly tests functionality and does not perform any unintended or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test suite for a cryptography library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and only performs intended testing operations.",
