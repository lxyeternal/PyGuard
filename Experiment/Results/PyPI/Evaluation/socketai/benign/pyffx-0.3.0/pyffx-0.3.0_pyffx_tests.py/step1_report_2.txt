{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the pyffx library's String and Integer encryption classes, verifying correct encryption and decryption functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded byte strings (b\"foo\", \"abc\") and integer inputs within test cases.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks; the code only tests encryption functions internally.",
  "flows": "The test cases encrypt data and then decrypt it, verifying data integrity; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code performs standard unit testing without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the pyffx library to perform deterministic encryption of strings and integers, with tests ensuring correctness. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The code is straightforward and follows standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for the pyffx encryption library with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
