  "purpose": "Unit tests for the pyffx library's String and Integer encryption classes to verify correct encryption and decryption behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input data: hardcoded strings and integers within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code only performs tests and assertions without external data flow or system interaction.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code runs internal tests without data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The tests do not invoke external or hidden network activities or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward unit tests using the unittest framework to test the functionality of the pyffx library's String and Integer classes. It performs standard operations such as encryption, decryption, and validation of outputs, including handling of errors and edge cases. There are no signs of malicious code, external data leaks, or hidden behaviors. The code is clean, well-structured, and solely focused on testing encryption functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It neither contains nor hints at any malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities. It appears safe and solely intended for testing purposes.",
