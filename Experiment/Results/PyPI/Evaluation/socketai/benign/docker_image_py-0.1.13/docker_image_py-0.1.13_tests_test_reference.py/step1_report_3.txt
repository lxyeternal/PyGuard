  "purpose": "Unit tests for parsing and validating Docker image references and names.",
  "sources": "Test input strings provided within test cases; parsing functions called with these inputs.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing parsed outputs to expected values; exception raising on invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Input strings → parsing functions → validation/assertion checks or exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines comprehensive unit tests for Docker image reference parsing and validation, covering numerous valid and invalid cases. It uses controlled input strings, assertions, and exception handling, with no evidence of external data reads, network interactions, or manipulation of untrusted data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The tests are static and predictable, designed solely for validation of reference parsing logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for validating Docker reference parsing and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured for correctness testing and poses no security threat.",
