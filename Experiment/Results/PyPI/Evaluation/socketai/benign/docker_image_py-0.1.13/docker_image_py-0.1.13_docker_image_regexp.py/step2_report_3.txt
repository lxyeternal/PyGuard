  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of regex pattern definitions for container image components. No external input, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** The report correctly notes that the code is static, pattern-based, and lacks external data or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — patterns are clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities identified.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that patterns are static and used for validation. No external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is safe, pattern definitions are static, and no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — slightly higher but still minimal; the code is safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs regex patterns for container image components, with input strings potentially used for matching.\n- **Findings:** The report emphasizes that the regex patterns are static, with no dynamic execution or external calls. The patterns are used for validation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines regex patterns for image references; patterns are static and for validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no dynamic code, no external data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with focus on pattern creation for validation, no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of obfuscation, malware, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still minimal, justified given the static pattern nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, pattern-based, and does not perform any malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all justified at 0, given the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are very low, with minor variations, but generally justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — patterns are clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, justified, as the code is purely for regex pattern definitions.\n\n**Overall:** The code appears to be a safe, standard utility for regex pattern creation for container image validation. No security concerns or malware risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the code content.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware score at 0.  \n- Maintain obfuscated at 0.  \n- Keep security risk low (~0.1–0.2).",
