  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for regex pattern creation related to container image validation. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores across the reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting minimal inherent risk due to pattern matching potential use with untrusted data."
