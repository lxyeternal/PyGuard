{
  "purpose": "Define and compile various regular expressions for matching image names, tags, digests, and identifiers in container image specifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads static regex pattern strings used to compile regex objects, which are then used elsewhere for matching input data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if these regex patterns are used to validate or process untrusted input data such as image tags, names, or digests; no direct data leakage or injection points are evident within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., image tags, names, digests) would flow into regex match functions, and the compiled regex objects are used for validation/matching purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code is present. The regex patterns are standard for image-related strings. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a regex library, defines a helper function _quote_meta for escaping special characters, and constructs various regex patterns for matching container image components such as names, tags, hostnames, and digests. The patterns are assembled using helper functions to ensure modularity and clarity. The patterns are standard and do not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. No input/output handling or external data sources are present, indicating this code is purely defining regex patterns for validation. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of regex pattern definitions intended for validating container image references. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe utility module for pattern matching, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
