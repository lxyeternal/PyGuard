{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes for validating digest strings, specifically cryptographic hash digests, ensuring they follow expected formats and lengths.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameter 'digest' in the validate_digest function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform insecure operations; it only raises exceptions based on validation results.",
  "flows": "Input 'digest' is matched against a regex pattern, then parsed to determine algorithm type and length, with validation checks performed on its format and length.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures or obfuscated code. Use of classmethods for default exceptions is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for digest errors and a validation function. The validation function uses a regex to verify digest format, extracts the algorithm, checks if it's supported, and verifies the digest length matches expected size. No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution present. The code is straightforward and focused solely on format validation without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard digest validation module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected checks without any malicious or harmful actions. Overall, the code is safe and not suspicious.",
