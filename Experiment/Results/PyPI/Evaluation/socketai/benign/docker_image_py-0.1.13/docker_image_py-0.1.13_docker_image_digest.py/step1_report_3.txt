{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for digest strings, ensuring they conform to expected patterns and lengths for specified algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input is taken via the 'digest' parameter in the 'validate_digest' function, which is expected to be a string.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any clear sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or malicious effects; it mainly performs validation and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input 'digest' is matched against a regex pattern, and if valid, the algorithm and digest part are extracted for validation; no further data flows or external actions are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard validation logic with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a regex object for digest pattern matching, defines several exception classes for invalid states, and validates digest strings based on pattern matching, algorithm support, and length checks. All operations are straightforward and focused on input validation without side effects. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility for digest strings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose without introducing security concerns.",
