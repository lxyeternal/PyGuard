  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code performs straightforward validation of digest strings: regex match, algorithm support, and length validation.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- Exception classes are standard and used for control flow.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The regex pattern is imported from a local module, but its content isn't provided; assuming it's a standard pattern for digest validation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code validates digest strings, checks format, supported algorithms, and length.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seems low but reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just validation logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; confirms straightforward validation.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to above; confirms no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as previous; no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seems correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same validation logic, no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code is purely validation logic with no external interactions or vulnerabilities, a low risk score (~0) is justified.\n\n**However,** the only minor point is that the regex pattern's security isn't verified here, but since it's imported and assumed to be standard, that doesn't raise concern.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to the possibility of misused regex or future vulnerabilities, but currently minimal)\n\n**Final Justification:** The code is a standard digest validation utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score reflects its safety profile.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
