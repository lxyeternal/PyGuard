  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the described issues, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code performs standard digest validation: regex matching, algorithm support, length validation.\n- No external data, network calls, or file operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code raises specific exceptions for invalid cases, which is standard practice.\n- The regex pattern is imported from a local module; assuming it is well-formed, it is used solely for format validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Correctly describes digest validation.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: Accurate.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Validates digest string format, algorithm, length; raises exceptions.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent or security risks.\n- Scores: `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2` seems low but acceptable given the validation context.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the straightforward validation logic. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Accurate.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: Correct.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies.\n- Analysis: Straightforward validation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n- Scores: `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0` appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Correct.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: Accurate.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies.\n- Analysis: Validates digest format and length, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0` appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Correct.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: Accurate.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies.\n- Analysis: Straightforward validation.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0` appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Correct.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: Accurate.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies.\n- Analysis: Validates digest format, length, algorithm support.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0` appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All are low (0 or 0.2). Given the code's purpose and implementation, these are reasonable. The only slight concern is the imported regex pattern, but since it's only used for validation, it does not pose a risk.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is standard validation logic, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The regex pattern's source is external (local module), but assuming it's well-formed, it doesn't introduce risks.\n- The exception classes are standard and used appropriately.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 - 0.2           | Very low; the code is purely validation, minimal risk.     |\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The security risk score can remain at 0.2, as in the reports, but even 0.1 would be reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, standard digest validation, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
