{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate cryptographic digest strings for correctness and supported algorithms.",
  "sources": "The digest parameter passed to the validate_digest function, which is likely user-provided or external input.",
  "sinks": "The function raises exceptions if the digest is invalid or unsupported; no external data output is present.",
  "flows": "Input digest -> validation checks (regex match, length, algorithm support) -> potential exception raised if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code. Use of regex matching for validation appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions and a validation function for digest strings. It verifies the format using regex, checks for presence of algorithm and length correctness. No external network or file operations are present. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns, nor does it process or leak data beyond validation. No indications of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs straightforward validation of digest strings with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for digest validation.",
