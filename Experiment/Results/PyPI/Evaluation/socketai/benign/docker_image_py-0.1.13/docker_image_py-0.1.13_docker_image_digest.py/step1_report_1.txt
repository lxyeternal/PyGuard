{
  "purpose": "This code appears to validate cryptographic digest strings, ensuring they conform to specific formats and supported algorithms.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'digest' parameter passed to the validate_digest function. It also imports regexp from a local module, likely reading from the imported DigestRegexps pattern.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the match operation on digest strings and raising custom exceptions, which are used for control flow but do not directly lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Input 'digest' is matched against a regex pattern, then parsed to extract the algorithm name and digest value, and validated against expected length and supported algorithms.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected. The code performs straightforward validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a regex pattern to validate digest strings, then checks for proper format, supported algorithms, and correct digest length based on predefined sizes. It raises specific exceptions if validation fails. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present. The overall logic is standard for digest validation and does not contain malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard digest validation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as intended for its purpose of ensuring digest string correctness.",
