{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define classes and a function for validating cryptographic digest strings, likely for verifying data integrity or signatures within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'digest' parameter passed into validate_digest function; it also imports 'regexp' from the same package, which likely contains regular expressions used for digest validation.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data causes security effects such as data leakage, code execution, or system compromise are present. The code only performs validation and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input from the 'digest' parameter flows through validation steps: regex matching, substring extraction, algorithm validation, and length checking. No external data or network operations are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious hard-coded credentials or obfuscated sections. It relies on regex matching and standard validation logic. No unusual or potentially malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for digest validation errors, a dictionary for expected digest sizes, and a validation function that checks digest format, algorithm support, and length correctness. It uses regex matching to verify digest format and extracts the algorithm to validate its support and length. No external data handling, network access, or potentially malicious code is present. The code performs standard data validation without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward digest validation utility without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs input validation using regex and length checks, with no external side effects or security risks identified.",
