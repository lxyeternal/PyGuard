  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'docker-image-py' Python package including dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports (os, setuptools), hardcoded strings (package name, version, URL), dependency list (regex>=2019.4.14).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or actions; setup configuration does not perform runtime data handling or external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code is static setup script, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, sets directory paths, defines a list of dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic execution, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors are present. The dependencies specified are benign, and the script performs typical package setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration for publishing a Python package.",
