  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'docker-image-py' to define dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The script reads its own file path (__file__) and the 'regex' package specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function does not contain any suspicious data sinks; no execution of untrusted data or external code occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The script performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', defines directory paths, specifies a single dependency ('regex>=2019.4.14'), and calls setup() with package information. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are processed. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
