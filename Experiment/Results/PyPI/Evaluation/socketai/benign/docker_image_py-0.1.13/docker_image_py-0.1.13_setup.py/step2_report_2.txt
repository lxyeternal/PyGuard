  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard, benign `setup.py` script for the `docker-image-py` package.\n- They identify no suspicious data flows, no untrusted data handling, no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- The only dependency is `regex>=2019.4.14`, which is a well-known package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if Issues Are Present\n- **Code Content:** The provided code matches the description in all reports.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a standard setup script with no security issues.\n- No flawed reasoning or overestimations are evident.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential Concerns or Assumptions\n- The reports assume the code is static and benign, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made, and none are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign `setup.py` script with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
