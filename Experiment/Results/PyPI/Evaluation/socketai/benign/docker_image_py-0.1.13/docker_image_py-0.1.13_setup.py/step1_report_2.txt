  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'docker-image-py' that specifies dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__) to determine directory locations; specifies a static dependency ('regex>=2019.4.14').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file output operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The script uses static configuration data to configure package installation; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic execution, malicious functions, or unusual logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging, importing os and setuptools, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies. It does not process user input or external data beyond static package configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
