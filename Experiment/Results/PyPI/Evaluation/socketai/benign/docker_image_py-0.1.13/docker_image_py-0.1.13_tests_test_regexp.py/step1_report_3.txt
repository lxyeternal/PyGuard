  "purpose": "Unit test for verifying regex patterns in the docker_image module",
  "sources": "The code defines regex pattern strings within the test function",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data; pattern strings are used solely for pattern matching within the module",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and defines a unittest class with a single test method that initializes various regex pattern strings. It then asserts that these patterns match the corresponding attributes in the ImageRegexps class from the docker_image module. All regex patterns are static string assignments and are used solely for pattern verification. There are no external inputs, no data transformations, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file I/O operations. The code appears to serve the purpose of ensuring pattern consistency and correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test verifying regex pattern constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code is straightforward, static, and has no suspicious elements.",
