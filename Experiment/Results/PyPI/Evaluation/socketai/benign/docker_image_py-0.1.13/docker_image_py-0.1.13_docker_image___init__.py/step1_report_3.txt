{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports three submodules ('digest', 'reference', 'regexp') and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, specifically relative imports of local submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data leaks, external communications, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only handles module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports three local modules using relative import syntax and defines __all__ to specify exported names. It contains no dynamic execution, network communication, or other suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py file or a module that organizes submodules. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module import/export boilerplate with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risks and appears to be a benign part of a larger package.",
