{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a module that imports submodules 'digest', 'reference', and 'regexp' and exposes them via the __all__ variable for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module environment to import submodules; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no data processing, output, or handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three submodules and exposes them via __all__, which is typical for organizing a package. There are no external data sources, no data processing, and no actions that could be malicious. The structure is simple and standard, indicating no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign package setup code that only manages imports and exports. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
