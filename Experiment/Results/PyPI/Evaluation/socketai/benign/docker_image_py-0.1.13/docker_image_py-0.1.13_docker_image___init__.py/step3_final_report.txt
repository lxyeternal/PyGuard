{
  "purpose": "This code imports three local modules ('digest', 'reference', 'regexp') and exposes them via __all__, serving as a module setup or __init__.py file.",
  "sources": "Relative imports of 'digest', 'reference', and 'regexp' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leakage or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import statements are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal, standard, and lacks suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module setup, importing local submodules and defining __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no malicious code, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions, and no issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary; the code poses no threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
