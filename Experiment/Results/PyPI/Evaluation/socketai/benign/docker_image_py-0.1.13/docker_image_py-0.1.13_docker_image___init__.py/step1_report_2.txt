  "purpose": "Defines an __all__ list for module exports, re-exporting digest, reference, and regexp modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: digest, reference, regexp",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted data; only module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports three modules from the same package and defines an __all__ list for exports. It does not include any code execution, data handling, or external communication. The structure is standard for Python package modules and does not contain any signs of malicious behavior or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer that sets up exports. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
