{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'stix' Python package, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'stix/version.py', reads long description from 'README.rst', reads requirements from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'open' function to read files; no direct sink of untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and long description, then proceeds to configure package setup with these values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script structure with no suspicious code or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines functions to retrieve version and description from files, specifies dependencies, and calls setup() with metadata. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data leaks. The use of 'open' for reading files is safe and controlled, and dependencies are specified with version constraints. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
