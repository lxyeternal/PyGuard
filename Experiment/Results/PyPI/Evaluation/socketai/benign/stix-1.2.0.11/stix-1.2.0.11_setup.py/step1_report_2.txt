  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'stix' Python package, managing version retrieval, description, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'stix/version.py' and 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external command executions observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It retrieves version info from a file, reads a README for description, and specifies dependencies and metadata. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code does not perform any network activity, file manipulations beyond reading local files, or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
