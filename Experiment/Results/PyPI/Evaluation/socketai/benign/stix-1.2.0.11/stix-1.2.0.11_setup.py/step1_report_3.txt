{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the STIX Python project, including dependency management and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'stix/version.py', reading the 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes untrusted data or executes untrusted commands. No network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Version file is read and parsed to obtain version; README file is read for description; dependencies are specified statically.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads version info from a local file and loads a README for description, then configures package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted input, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. The dependencies are static and based on specified package versions, and there are no network or system operations performed at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
