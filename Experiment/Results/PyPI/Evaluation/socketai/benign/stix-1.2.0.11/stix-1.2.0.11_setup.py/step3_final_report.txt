{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script facilitates packaging and distribution of the 'stix' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'stix/version.py' and long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; only local file reads and static package setup functions.",
  "flows": "Version extraction from local file, description reading, and dependency specification are straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for Python packaging. It reads local files for version and description, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and uses safe modules. No network activity, user input handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic is clear, and the code adheres to common practices. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The overall security risk is negligible, and no further action is necessary.",
