  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'stix', handling version retrieval, description, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'stix/version.py' and 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data sources are from static files or defined variables.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from file -> configuring setup() parameters with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading version info from a file, reading long description from a file, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. All file reads are from static, expected locations. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used in a malicious manner. No suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious commands, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely manages package configuration without external or untrusted data sources.",
