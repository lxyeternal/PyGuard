{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'stix', including version retrieval, description, dependencies, and metadata for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from the version.py file to get the package version, and from README.rst to get the long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; it mainly reads static files and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply reads local files and constructs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines functions to read version and description from local files, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. Dependencies are specified via static strings. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It securely reads version info and description from local files and configures package installation. No malware or security risks detected.",
