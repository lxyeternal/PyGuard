{
  "purpose": "A static example demonstrating how to add CIQ Identity information to a STIX Indicator, using hardcoded data for illustration.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data; uses standard library functions and predefined data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data with no dynamic input or output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a File object with a hash, creates an Indicator, and adds CIQ identity components with hardcoded values. It then builds a STIX package, sets header info, and includes the indicator. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code relies on standard libraries and well-documented external modules. It serves purely as an illustrative example without malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static demonstration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, illustrative purpose. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with its static, demonstrative nature.",
