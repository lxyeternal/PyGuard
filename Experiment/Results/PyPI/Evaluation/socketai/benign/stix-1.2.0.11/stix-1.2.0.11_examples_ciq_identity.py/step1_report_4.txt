{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to create a STIX package with CIQ Identity information and a file hash indicator, primarily for cybersecurity threat intelligence sharing.",
  "sources": "Reads static strings, imported libraries, and predefined variables (e.g., hash, address, identity details). No untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the generated STIX XML and dictionary via print statements. No sinks process untrusted data for storage or network transmission within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static definitions and library calls through object creation and configuration, ultimately leading to serialization and printing. There are no flows involving untrusted data sources or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. All functions and methods appear standard and intended for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward example of constructing a cybersecurity indicator using standard libraries. It creates a file object with a hash, constructs a CIQ identity with detailed attributes, associates the identity with the indicator, and packages everything into a STIX document. The code does not read user input or external data, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example illustrating how to assemble a STIX package with CIQ identity information. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, only standard library usage for threat intelligence data modeling.",
