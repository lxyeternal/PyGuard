  "purpose": "This script demonstrates how to add CIQ Identity information to a STIX Indicator for cybersecurity threat intelligence sharing.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses hardcoded data for identity and address information within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; outputs are serialized XML and dictionary representations of the STIX package.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded identity and address objects into the STIX package, then outputs as XML and dict.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets beyond typical test data. No dynamic execution or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a STIX package with a File object, indicator, and identity information, all derived from static, hardcoded data. It does not process external input or execute any external commands. No potential injection points, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident. The use of hardcoded identifiers is typical for example or testing code, not malicious activity. The code properly utilizes established libraries for threat intelligence data modeling. No anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating the assembly of a STIX package with identity information. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured example script.",
