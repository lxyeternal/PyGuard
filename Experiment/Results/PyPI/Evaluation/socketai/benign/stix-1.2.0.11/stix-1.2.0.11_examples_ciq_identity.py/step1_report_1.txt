{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate how to add CIQ Identity information to a STIX indicator package, including creating various identity components and integrating them into a STIX package.",
  "sources": "Reads static data for the hash, identity details, address, and other attributes; no user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the XML representation of the STIX package and a printed dictionary of the package; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Static data constructs the identity and indicator objects; data flows into the STIX package creation and serialization to XML.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution; straightforward use of well-documented library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a File object with a hardcoded hash, constructs a STIX Indicator, and adds a detailed CIQ identity with address, nationality, and contact info. It then assembles a STIX package with header information and outputs the package in XML and dictionary formats. All data appears to be static and for demonstration purposes. No external inputs, untrusted data sources, or suspicious behavior are present. The libraries used are standard for STIX and CybOX handling and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example script designed to demonstrate adding identity information to a STIX indicator. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely as a sample for STIX package creation with no harmful or suspicious elements.",
