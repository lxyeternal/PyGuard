{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to create a STIX package with CIQ Identity information and a file hash indicator.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from hardcoded strings, constants, and external library functions (e.g., utils.dates.now()).",
  "sinks": "Outputs XML and dictionary representations via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded strings, constants) flows into object creation and is serialized to XML/dict for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and external libraries appears benign. No obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and external libraries to construct a STIX package with an indicator and CIQ identity details. It creates a file object with a hash, an indicator, and a complex identity object, then serializes and prints the results. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code serves an illustrative purpose and relies on established libraries, with no suspicious logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example demonstrating the creation of a STIX package with CIQ Identity extension. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
