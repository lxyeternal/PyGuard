  "purpose": "Build a STIX Document with Tool Information",
  "sources": "Static initialization of tool name and vendor; no external input or data reading",
  "sinks": "Outputting XML and dictionary representations of the STIX package; no untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "Creation of ToolInformation object -> setting it in ToolInformationList -> assigning to information_source.tools -> output via to_xml() and to_dict()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a STIX package with static, hardcoded tool information, outputs it in XML and dict formats, and involves no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It employs well-known open-source libraries and performs no malicious or suspicious operations. The structure is clear and readable, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, static utility for creating a cybersecurity data object with no malicious or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.",
