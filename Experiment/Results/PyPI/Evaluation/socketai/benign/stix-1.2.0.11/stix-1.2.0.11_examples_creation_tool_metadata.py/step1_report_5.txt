  "purpose": "Builds a STIX document with tool information, primarily for malware analysis or threat intelligence sharing.",
  "sources": "User executes the script, or external systems invoke main(), but there are no explicit external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputting XML and dict representations of the STIX package; no data leaks or external communication besides print statements.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static data used for tool info, and output is merely printing generated data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries and well-documented third-party libraries for structured data creation.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a structured STIX package with tool information, utilizing legitimate libraries for cyber threat intelligence representation. No input handling or external data fetching occurs. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, or suspicious logic are present. The code's purpose is to generate and output structured threat data, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for generating threat intelligence data in STIX format. No malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
