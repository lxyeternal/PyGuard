  "purpose": "Builds a STIX Document with tool information for cybersecurity threat intelligence sharing.",
  "sources": "Reads static string inputs for tool_name and tool_vendor in ToolInformation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs XML and dictionary representations of the STIX package; no untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No external data flow; static data used for tool info and output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. Usage of well-known libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a STIX package, sets headers and tool info, and outputs the data in XML and dict formats. All data is hardcoded and only involves standard library calls and well-established cybersecurity modeling libraries. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for creating a cybersecurity threat intelligence document. No signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
