  "purpose": "Builds a STIX Document with tool information for cybersecurity sharing.",
  "sources": "Reads static imports, and constructs objects and strings within the main() function.",
  "targets": "Outputs XML representation of the STIX package and a printed dictionary.",
  "flows": "Creates ToolInformation and adds to STIXHeader, then outputs data via to_xml() and to_dict().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and specific cybersecurity libraries, creates structured STIX data objects, and outputs their representations. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network communication, no data leakage, nor obfuscated or malicious code. The use of static strings and library functions aligns with intended functionality. No anomalies indicating malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward example script for creating and exporting cybersecurity data in STIX format. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious behavior. It is a safe utility script intended for data structuring and output.",
