  "purpose": "Builds a STIX Document with Tool Information for threat intelligence sharing.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; static data used for tool and vendor names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or external connections.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment to STIX package and header objects; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a STIX package with tool information and prints its XML and dictionary representations. It uses static, hardcoded values with well-defined libraries, and contains no input, network operations, or sensitive data handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data manipulation. The code serves as a simple example or utility for creating threat intelligence data.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and intended for constructing and displaying threat intelligence data structures. No malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
