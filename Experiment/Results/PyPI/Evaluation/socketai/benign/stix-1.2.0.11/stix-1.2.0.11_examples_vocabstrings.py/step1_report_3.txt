{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of VocabString for STIX Controlled Vocabularies, specifically adding package intents to a STIXHeader object and outputting XML.",
  "sources": "Reads standard input via the script's execution environment (not explicitly), and uses hardcoded string values within the code.",
  "sinks": "Outputs XML to standard output, potentially revealing internal data structures. Also prints exception messages to standard output.",
  "flows": "Uses VocabString objects to add controlled and non-controlled vocabulary terms to the header. Exception handling flow for invalid string input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is primarily for demonstration purposes and uses standard library classes. No network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from the 'stix' library to create and manipulate a STIXHeader object. It appends a standard PackageIntent and a non-standard VocabString to demonstrate flexibility. It also includes exception handling when trying to add an invalid string as a vocabulary term. The script outputs XML representation of the header. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code is straightforward, educational, and does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign demonstration of using the 'stix' library for vocabulary management within STIX objects. It contains no malware, malicious code, or security risks. It only prints data and handles expected exceptions.",
