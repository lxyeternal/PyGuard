  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of VocabString for STIX Controlled Vocabularies, specifically how to add custom and default package intent values and handle errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'stix.core' and 'stix.common.vocabs'; the instantiation of VocabString and STIXHeader; appending items to header.package_intents",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statements outputting XML and error messages",
  "flows": "VocabString instances are appended to header.package_intents, then outputted as XML; errors are caught and printed",
  "anomalies": "None; standard usage of library functions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The script creates a STIXHeader object, appends controlled vocabulary terms, and demonstrates how to add non-standard terms via VocabString. It also handles exceptions when invalid string values are appended. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. The code relies on the 'stix' library, which is a legitimate open-source tool for cybersecurity data modeling. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of using the 'stix' library to manage vocabulary terms. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. It performs standard library usage without any malicious payloads or obfuscated logic.",
