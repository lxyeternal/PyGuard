  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of VocabString for managing STIX controlled vocabularies and creating XML output.",
  "sources": "Imports from stix.core and stix.common.vocabs modules, creation of VocabString instances, appending to header.package_intents, and printing XML output.",
  "sinks": "Printing to console, appending to package_intents, converting header to XML.",
  "flows": "Creation of VocabString → appending to header.package_intents → header.to_xml() → print output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behavior; standard use of external library classes and exception handling for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a STIXHeader object, appends predefined and custom vocabulary terms via VocabString objects, and prints the XML representation. It includes a controlled attempt to add an invalid string to trigger a ValueError, which is handled gracefully. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or malicious logic present. Use of external libraries for standard data processing is typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard demonstration of utilizing STIX vocabularies with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles validation correctly and does not perform any harmful actions. Overall, it appears safe.",
