{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of VocabString for managing controlled vocabularies within STIX headers, specifically handling package intents.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; the code primarily creates objects and appends predefined or controlled vocabulary terms.",
  "sinks": "The code prints XML output generated from the STIXHeader object; no data is sent or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Creates STIXHeader and VocabString objects, appends predefined and custom values, then outputs XML; no external data flows or injections.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. Proper use of try-except to handle ValueError when invalid string is added.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a STIXHeader object and appends controlled vocabulary terms, including a custom non-standard value via VocabString. It demonstrates correct handling of vocabulary constraints and error handling when invalid string is used. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard demonstration of handling controlled vocabularies within the STIX framework. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It adheres to proper use of the library and safe coding practices.",
