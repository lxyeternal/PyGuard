{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of VocabString for STIX controlled vocabularies, creating a STIXHeader, appending standard and custom vocabulary terms, and handling invalid input with exception handling.",
  "sources": "Creates instances of STIXHeader, VocabString, and PackageIntent; reads no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "Prints the generated XML; no data sinks or external data flows involved.",
  "flows": "Creates objects, appends vocabulary terms, and outputs XML; no untrusted data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a custom non-standard vocabulary string; exception handling for invalid string input; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a STIXHeader, appends controlled vocabulary terms including a custom term, and demonstrates error handling when attempting to add an invalid string. It performs straightforward object creation and method calls, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code is clear and well-structured. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The print statements output the XML and error messages for demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational example illustrating controlled vocabulary management in the 'stix' library. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports is unwarranted; overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
