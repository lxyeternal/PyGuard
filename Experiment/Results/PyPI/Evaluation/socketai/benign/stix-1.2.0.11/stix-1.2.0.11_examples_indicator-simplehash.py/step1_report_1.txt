  "purpose": "Builds a STIX file hash observable document for cybersecurity analysis.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static data used within the code.",
  "sinks": "Outputting the STIX package as XML via print().",
  "flows": "Static hash value assigned -> File object with hash added -> STIX package created and hash added -> XML output generated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets beyond the static hash, and no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a STIX Package with a file hash observable using static, hardcoded hash data. It uses well-known libraries (cybox, stix) for standard data modeling. No input handling, no external data fetches, and no network activity or system modification. The static hash appears to be an example or test data, consistent with an educational or demonstration purpose. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign example script demonstrating how to create and output a STIX file hash observable. It contains no malware or security risks.",
