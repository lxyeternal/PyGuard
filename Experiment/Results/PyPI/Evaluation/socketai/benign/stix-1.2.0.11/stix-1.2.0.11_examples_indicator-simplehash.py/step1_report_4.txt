{
  "purpose": "Builds a STIX File Hash Observable document and outputs it as XML",
  "sources": "Reads no external input, only constructs objects and outputs a static XML representation",
  "sinks": "Outputs XML data via print, no untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources; static data flows to XML serialization and printing",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded hash value; no dynamic or untrusted input handling; no suspicious library misuse",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a static STIX package with a fixed MD5 hash, adds descriptive header, and prints the XML output. No user input, network activity, or data leakage points are involved. The code leverages standard, open-source libraries in a straightforward manner without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign example for generating a STIX file hash observable. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
