  "purpose": "Builds a STIX File Hash Observable document for cybersecurity data exchange.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; uses hardcoded hash value.",
  "sinks": "Outputs XML representation of the STIX package; no untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Creates hash, adds to file object, adds file object to STIX package, outputs XML.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded hash value; no dynamic or external data input; no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a static STIX package with a predefined file hash. It imports standard libraries, creates objects, and outputs XML. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network activity, and no malicious logic. The purpose is straightforward and aligned with standard threat intelligence sharing.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign example for generating a STIX file hash observable. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
