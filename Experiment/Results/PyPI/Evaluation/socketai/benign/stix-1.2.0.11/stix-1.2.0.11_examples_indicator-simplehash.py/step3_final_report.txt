  "purpose": "Constructs a static STIX File Hash Observable with a hardcoded MD5 hash, intended as an example or test artifact.",
  "sources": "No external input; uses hardcoded hash value within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Static hash value assigned to Hash object -> added to File object -> included in STIX package -> output as XML.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, static data, no obfuscation or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a static MD5 hash, embeds it into a File object, wraps it in a STIX package with a descriptive header, and outputs the XML. It employs standard libraries without external input, network activity, or dynamic data. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The static nature and use of well-known libraries confirm its benign, demonstrative purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static example for generating a STIX file hash observable. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, aligning with its straightforward, educational intent.",
  "confidence": 1,
