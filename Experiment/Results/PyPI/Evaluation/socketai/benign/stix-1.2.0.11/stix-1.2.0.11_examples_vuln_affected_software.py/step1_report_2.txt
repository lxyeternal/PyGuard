{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates setting the 'affected_software' property on a STIX Vulnerability object for documentation or security research purposes.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data for software properties, imports from cybox and stix libraries, and constructs objects based on predefined values.",
  "sinks": "Outputs an XML representation of a STIX package via print statement.",
  "flows": "Constructs software object -> wraps in observable -> assigns to vulnerability -> associates with exploit target -> creates STIX package -> outputs XML.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard library functions and constructs data objects without any suspicious behavior or data leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward example of creating a STIX package with vulnerability and affected software information. It imports known libraries, constructs data objects with static data, and outputs the package XML. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The purpose appears to be illustrative or for testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of constructing a security data package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
