{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to add campaign references to an indicator within a STIX package, primarily for constructing threat intelligence data structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads from in-memory objects such as Campaign, CampaignRef, and Indicator; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs XML via print(), which could be considered a sink for serialized data, but it is benign in this context.",
  "flows": "The code creates campaign objects, references them via campaign references, associates them with an indicator, and then serializes the package. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of the STIX library appears straightforward and typical for threat intel data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard classes from the STIX library to build a threat intelligence package, including campaigns and indicators. It constructs objects, associates campaigns with indicators via references, and serializes the package to XML. No external data sources, untrusted input, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs purely data modeling operations with no network, file, or environment interactions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of constructing a STIX package with campaign and indicator relationships. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure is clear and intended for demonstration or testing purposes.",
