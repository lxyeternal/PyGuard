  "purpose": "Demonstrates adding related Campaign references to a STIX Indicator object and packaging them into a STIX package.",
  "sources": "Reading of static Campaign and Indicator object properties, use of the 'id_' attribute of Campaign objects.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'add_related_campaign' method on Indicator objects, adding Campaign objects to STIXPackage.",
  "flows": "Campaign objects are added to the Indicator via 'add_related_campaign', CampaignRef is created from Campaign's 'id_', then the Indicator and Campaigns are added to the STIX package.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code uses standard STIX library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs Campaign objects and references, then adds them to an Indicator, and packages everything into a STIXPackage. The process is straightforward, focusing on data structure setup without external input or data leaks. No suspicious network calls, no data exfiltration, and no use of environment variables or insecure operations. The code performs typical data model setup for threat intelligence representation, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard demonstration of constructing and packaging threat intelligence data using the STIX library. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious anomalies identified. It is safe and intended for demonstration purposes.",
