  "purpose": "Demonstrates the methods for adding related Campaign references to an Indicator object within a STIX package.",
  "sources": "Static creation of Campaign, CampaignRef, and Indicator objects; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "CampaignRef.idref ← Campaign.id_ → Indicator.add_related_campaign → STIXPackage serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs Campaign and Indicator objects, relates them via CampaignRef, and serializes the package. It uses standard library functions with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. No external inputs or network activity are present. The use of 'id_' assumes auto-generation by the library, which is typical. The code is static and purely demonstrative, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward example of modeling threat intelligence data with the STIX library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
