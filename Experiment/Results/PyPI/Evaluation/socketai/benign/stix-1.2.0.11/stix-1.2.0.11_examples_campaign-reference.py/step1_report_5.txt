  "purpose": "The script demonstrates how to create and relate Campaign and Indicator objects within a STIX package, and then serialize it to XML.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from variables such as campaign titles and campaign/indicator object instantiations.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs an XML representation of the STIX package via print, but does not involve untrusted data input or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "The code creates Campaign objects, references them via CampaignRef, adds them to an Indicator, and then packages everything into a STIXPackage, finally outputting the XML.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code primarily manipulates data structures and outputs XML.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward creation and association of objects within the STIX framework, using static data and object references. No external input, no data leaks, nor malicious network activity are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden behaviors. It serves as a demonstrative example of building a STIX package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended as a demonstration of STIX object relationships. No malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
