{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to create and relate Campaign and Indicator objects within a STIX package, then serializes the package to XML.",
  "sources": "Reads campaign titles and indicator data from object instantiations and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the serialized XML to standard output.",
  "flows": "Creates Campaign objects -> creates CampaignRef and Indicator objects -> adds related campaigns -> adds objects to STIX package -> outputs XML.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Uses standard STIX library functions without unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs STIX Campaign and Indicator objects, relates campaigns to indicators, and outputs an XML package. The use of the STIX library appears standard, and no untrusted data sources or network activity are present. The code does not perform any file manipulation, network operations, or sensitive data handling beyond object creation and serialization. The methods used are typical for building structured threat intelligence data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve a demonstration or testing purpose related to STIX data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely as an example for creating and relating STIX Campaign and Indicator objects. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
