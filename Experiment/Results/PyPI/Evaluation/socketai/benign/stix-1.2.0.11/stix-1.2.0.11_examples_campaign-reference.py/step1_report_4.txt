{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to create and relate Campaign and Indicator objects within a STIX package, ultimately exporting it as XML.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for campaign titles; it accesses object properties like `camp2.id_` when creating references.",
  "sinks": "The code calls `print` to output the generated XML; no untrusted data sinks or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "The code constructs Campaign and Indicator objects, creates references, and adds them to a STIX package, then outputs the package as XML.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual logic. The code uses standard STIX object construction methods.",
  "analysis": "The script creates Campaign objects with static titles, references one campaign via its `id_`, and associates campaigns with an Indicator object. It then adds these objects to a STIX package and prints the XML output. The code appears straightforward, with no dynamic data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns. It relies on the STIX library to structure data and does not include any potentially malicious operations or data flows. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple demonstration of building a STIX package with Campaign and Indicator objects. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and intended for illustrative purposes.",
