{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the creation, registration, parsing, and serialization of custom VocabString controlled vocabulary implementations within a STIX package.",
  "sources": "Reads input XML string (XML variable), reads data during parsing via STIXPackage.from_xml()",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements; no untrusted data flow to external systems or files",
  "flows": "Input XML data is parsed into a STIXPackage object, which is then manipulated and serialized back to XML for output",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated 'StringIO' from Python 2; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; vocabulary validation is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for STIX and vocabulary handling, registers a custom namespace and vocabulary, parses a static XML string, modifies the package by adding another custom vocabulary term, and serializes the package back to XML. No user input or external data sources are involved. No dangerous functions, code injection points, or malicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard library usage for XML parsing and object serialization, with controlled vocabulary validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard demonstration script for handling custom vocabularies within STIX packages. It does not include any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe, with low likelihood of security issues.",
