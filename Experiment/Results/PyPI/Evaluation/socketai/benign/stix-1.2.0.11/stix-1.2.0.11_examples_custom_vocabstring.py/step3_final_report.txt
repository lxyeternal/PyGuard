  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use and parsing of custom VocabString controlled vocabulary implementations within a STIX package.",
  "sources": "Static XML string representing the STIX package; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Serialization of the modified STIX package back to XML; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Parsing static XML -> Accessing and printing Package_Intent -> Adding new CustomVocab -> Serializing package to XML.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated Python 2 StringIO module; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration script that defines a custom vocabulary, registers its namespace, parses a static XML string, retrieves and prints existing data, adds a new vocabulary term, and serializes the package. It operates solely on static data with no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The vocabulary validation is explicit and safe. The use of deprecated modules is noted but not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified given the static, controlled nature of the code. No further action or concern is necessary.",
