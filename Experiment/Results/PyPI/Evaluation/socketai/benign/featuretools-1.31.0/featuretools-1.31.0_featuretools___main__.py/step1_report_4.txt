{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script for processing data, possibly for logging or data transformation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters and possibly environment variables or external files if used elsewhere in the code.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, logs, or external systems; no direct malicious sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through functions and then outputted or stored; no suspicious data flow paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard Python syntax and uses common libraries or constructs. No signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code structure is straightforward, and there are no hidden or suspicious code segments. It reads data from inputs, processes it, and outputs results normally. The absence of external network calls, encrypted strings, or environment variables with secrets further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe and typical for data processing tasks.",
