  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of exec and subprocess warrants cautious handling, but without evidence of untrusted input exploitation, the low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Slightly increasing the security risk score for code involving these functions is recommended, but overall, the code is considered low risk."
