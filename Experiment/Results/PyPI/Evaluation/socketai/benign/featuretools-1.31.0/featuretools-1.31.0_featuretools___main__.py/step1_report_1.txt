{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some operations, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or evaluation functions like eval().",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, possibly involving dynamic code execution or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or clear backdoors detected. However, look for obscure eval() usage, dynamic imports, or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step review shows standard imports and functions with no overt malicious code. Some areas of concern include usage of eval() with unvalidated input, dynamic imports, or suspicious network requests, but none are clearly present in the provided code snippet. The code structure and formatting appear normal, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evident malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The code seems to perform routine operations without security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
