  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only three variable assignments setting version strings. There are no input sources, data processing, external calls, or suspicious patterns. The code is standard for version metadata in Python packages. No obfuscation, malicious code, or embedded payloads are present. The simplicity and clarity of the code strongly suggest benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence scores are high (1), justified by the straightforwardness. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version metadata with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
