      "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin loader with inherent supply chain risks due to dynamic external code execution. No evidence of malicious activity is present within this snippet, but the pattern warrants cautious management of plugin sources. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to the attack surface introduced by external plugins, while the likelihood of malicious code embedded in this code is very low."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of exec and subprocess warrants cautious handling, but without evidence of untrusted input exploitation, the low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Slightly increasing the security risk score for code involving these functions is recommended, but overall, the code is considered low risk."
