  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the provided code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the functions as utility tools for time series data, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network interactions are present, consistent with the code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code uses standard libraries appropriately.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is legitimate and safe aligns with the analysis. Confidence is high (1.0).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, well-founded, and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the functions as for temporal data handling, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or unsafe actions are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly states the code is safe, with a very high confidence (1.0).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.1 — acceptable, considering the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion that the code is safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately reflects the code's utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, the code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0 — fitting.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the functions' roles.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly concludes safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs typical data processing tasks. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (~0.0 to 0.1) is appropriate. The highest is 0.1, which is acceptable.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the potential for misuse if integrated into larger, malicious pipelines, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately score the code. The code is a legitimate utility module for time series data processing with no security concerns evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
