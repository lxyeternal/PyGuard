  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating temporal cutoff times, converting time units, transforming datetime/timedelta objects into floats, and calculating trends in data series.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as instance_ids, cutoffs, start times, and input datetime or timedelta objects.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network interactions, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations and pandas data manipulations within functions; no external sinks or network calls are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard data processing utilities for time series analysis, using common libraries pandas and numpy. It performs legitimate operations such as generating date ranges, converting units, and trend calculations. No external system interactions, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The functions are well-structured, with appropriate error handling and clear purpose. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for time series data processing. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be set to 0.0. The obfuscated score remains 0.0, and the security risk score can be confidently set at 0.0.",
