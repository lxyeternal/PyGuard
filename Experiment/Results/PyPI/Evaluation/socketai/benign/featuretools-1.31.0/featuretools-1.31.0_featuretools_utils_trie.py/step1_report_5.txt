  "purpose": "Implementation of a Trie (prefix tree) data structure for storing sequences of hashable objects with customizable default values and path construction.",
  "sources": "Input paths provided to get_node() method; internal _children dictionary storing child nodes; default function provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to node.value via get_node(), iteration over the Trie, potentially exposing stored values; internal data structures (e.g., _children) may be accessed or modified externally.",
  "flows": "Input paths from user to get_node() -> access/creation of child nodes in _children -> retrieval or modification of node.value -> iteration over all nodes yields (path, value) pairs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code relies solely on standard data structure manipulation with clear documentation and examples.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Trie data structure with methods for node retrieval, iteration, and children listing. It uses safe, standard Python features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external interactions. The code is well-structured, with proper handling of default values and path construction. No unusual or hidden behaviors are present. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Trie data structure, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Trie with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for storing and retrieving sequence-based keys. There are no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
