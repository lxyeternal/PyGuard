  "purpose": "Initialize logging configuration and manage a simple configuration object with default paths.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for log levels, file path determination via __file__",
  "sinks": "Logging output streams, reading environment variables, accessing file system paths",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> logging configuration; __file__ path -> configuration data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code primarily configures logging based on environment variables and sets up a simple configuration object with a default data folder path derived from __file__. No external inputs are processed in a way that could lead to code injection or data leakage. The environment variables influence log level configuration, but do not control code execution beyond standard logging setup. The path setup uses __file__, which is standard and safe. No malicious or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for logging and configuration management with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
