{
  "purpose": "This code initializes logging configurations based on environment variables and sets up a configuration object with default data paths.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FEATURETOOLS_LOG_LEVEL, FEATURETOOLS_ES_LOG_LEVEL, FEATURETOOLS_BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL), file path (__file__)",
  "sinks": "Logging system (console output), reading environment variables, accessing __file__ for path",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> setting log levels -> configuring loggers; __file__ -> determining default data folder path",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control logging levels is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no code injection or obfuscated code present; path construction based on __file__ is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging levels for different modules based on environment variables, defaulting to 'info' if unspecified. It configures handlers for console output. The Config class manages a data dictionary, initializing it with a path relative to the script's location. The code uses standard modules and practices, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The environment variable usage is standard for configuration, and file path determination is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical setup for logging and configuration management without malicious intent. It does not contain malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks. All behaviors are consistent with standard application initialization routines.",
