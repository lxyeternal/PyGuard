  "purpose": "Initialize logging configuration and manage application settings with default values.",
  "sources": "os.environ for environment variables; __file__ for current script path",
  "sinks": "logging configuration (setting log levels and handlers); os.path.join for constructing file paths",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log levels; __file__ influences data folder path in Config",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Use of environment variables for log levels is common; __file__ usage is standard for file path",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging based on environment variables and defaults to info level. It then defines a Config class managing a data dictionary, primarily storing a path to a 'primitives/data' directory relative to the script. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no data leaks are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for configuration management and logging setup. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for logging and configuration management without any malicious intent. It relies on environment variables for log level configuration and uses the script's directory to set a data folder path. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected.",
