  "purpose": "This code initializes logging configuration and manages a configuration object with default data paths.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for log levels (FEATURETOOLS_LOG_LEVEL, FEATURETOOLS_ES_LOG_LEVEL, FEATURETOOLS_BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL), __file__ for directory path",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout, access to environment variables, file path construction for 'primitive_data_folder'",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> log level settings -> logger configuration; __file__ -> directory path -> config data",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control log levels is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging levels based on environment variables, with default fallback levels. It constructs a path based on the current script directory for configuration data. The Config class provides methods for accessing and updating configuration data, with no dynamic code execution or external network access. The overall structure appears normal and intended for configuration management and logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging setup and configuration management without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
