  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking, formatting, and saving Graphviz graphs within the featuretools library.",
  "sources": "import_or_raise from featuretools.utils.gen_utils, user-provided file paths (to_file), internal graphviz methods.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (saving graphs), dynamic file name handling, possible use of untrusted paths if user input is directly passed.",
  "flows": "User provides 'to_file' paths -> get_graphviz_format validates and extracts format -> save_graph uses render to save graph to specified path.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious network activity or data leaks, straightforward usage of external library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of Graphviz and its backend, raises informative errors if missing, extracts file formats from user input, and saves graphs accordingly. All operations are standard for graph rendering and file management. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on external libraries and user input but handles it safely with proper validation. No anomalies or indicators of sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for handling Graphviz graphs, with proper error handling and input validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
