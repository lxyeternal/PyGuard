  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking Graphviz installation, validating output formats, and saving graphs with proper validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "import_or_raise for dependency import, user-supplied 'to_file' filename for format inference and saving, graphviz.Digraph() for rendering.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data to network or files without validation; potential indirect risk if 'to_file' is maliciously crafted to overwrite or traverse directories, but validation of extension mitigates this.",
  "flows": "import_or_raise loads 'graphviz' (source); 'to_file' filename is validated and manipulated (source); graphviz.Digraph().pipe() or render() outputs data to specified path (sink); validation ensures only correct formats are used (validation flow).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code present; standard dependency and file handling with validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency checking, format validation, and graph rendering with proper exception handling. It relies on user input for filenames but validates extensions to prevent format errors. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or insecure practices are evident. The risk mainly stems from user-controlled filenames, which are validated for extensions, reducing potential vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2), consistent across reports. Overall, the code is a safe, standard utility module with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for Graphviz integration, with appropriate validation and error handling. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
