  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate plugin management wrapper with no malicious intent. The main security risk stems from external plugins that could be malicious if untrusted. The code itself is safe, and the scores reflect a moderate risk due to plugin trustworthiness. Proper validation or sandboxing of plugins is recommended to mitigate potential risks."
