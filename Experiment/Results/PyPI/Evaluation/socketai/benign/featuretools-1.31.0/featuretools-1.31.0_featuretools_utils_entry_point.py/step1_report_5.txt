  "purpose": "Decorator for registering and managing entry points that invoke callbacks on function calls, errors, and returns.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.iter_entry_points for dynamic loading of entry point modules.",
  "sinks": "Calling loaded entry point functions, invoking on_call, on_error, and on_return methods.",
  "flows": "Entry points are loaded and their callback methods are called with function arguments, errors, or return values.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic loading of entry points and invocation of their methods could be suspicious if entry points are maliciously crafted. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present, but reliance on external modules may introduce risks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that registers callback functions via entry points, dynamically loading and executing them before and after the decorated function runs. It captures runtime metrics and propagates errors. No suspicious or malicious code detected within this snippet. Potential security concerns depend on the nature of external entry points, which are loaded dynamically. If malicious, they could execute arbitrary code, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. The use of pkg_resources for dynamic code execution warrants caution but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a decorator that manages entry points for callback execution. No malicious intent identified within this code snippet itself. Potential security risk depends on external entry points which are loaded at runtime, but this is common in plugin architectures.",
