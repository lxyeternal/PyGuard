  "sinks": "Calling ep.on_call, ep.on_error, ep.on_return methods on loaded entry points.",
  "flows": "Function invocation -> Load and invoke entry points' methods -> Return function result.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic loading of entry points which could be exploited if malicious plugins are present. No direct malicious code detected, but dynamic plugin execution is a potential risk if untrusted plugins are used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator factory 'entry_point' which registers a decorator for functions. The decorator loads entry points with a given name using pkg_resources, then calls their 'on_call' method before executing the wrapped function, and calls 'on_return' or 'on_error' after execution. The core logic is standard plugin management and logging, with no evident malicious behavior. However, the use of dynamic loading of entry points from potentially untrusted sources can be a security concern if plugins are compromised or maliciously crafted, as they could execute arbitrary code via their 'on_call', 'on_error', or 'on_return' methods. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are evident within this code itself. It mainly facilitates extensibility and monitoring via plugins.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a plugin-based wrapper for functions that manages plugin invocation and error handling. It does not contain malicious code but relies on external plugins loaded dynamically, which could pose security risks if untrusted plugins are used. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected within the provided code. Overall, moderate security concern due to dynamic plugin loading.",
