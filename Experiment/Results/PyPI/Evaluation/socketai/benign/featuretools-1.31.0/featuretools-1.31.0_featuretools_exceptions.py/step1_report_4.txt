  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for use in larger Python applications.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions do not read external input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data effects present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow, as classes do not process or pass data in a way that affects system security.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; simple class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom classes: 'UnknownFeature' as an exception class inheriting from Exception, and 'UnusedPrimitiveWarning' as a user warning. Both are standard constructs without any data handling or external communication. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The classes serve to improve code clarity or error handling but do not contain any suspicious logic or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines custom exception and warning classes for use elsewhere. No anomalies, malware, or security concerns detected.",
