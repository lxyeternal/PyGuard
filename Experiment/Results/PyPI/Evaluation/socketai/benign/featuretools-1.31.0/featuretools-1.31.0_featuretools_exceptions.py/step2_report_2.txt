  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The original code defines two classes:\n   - `UnknownFeature` inheriting from `Exception`, with a custom `__init__` that calls the base constructor.\n   - `UnusedPrimitiveWarning` inheriting from `UserWarning`, with no additional logic.\n\n   These are straightforward class definitions with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as simple class definitions with no security concerns. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports agree on zero risk and no malicious activity, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and based on static analysis, correctly avoiding assumptions about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n8. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, straightforward Python module defining custom exception and warning classes. It does not process external data, perform any dynamic actions, or contain any suspicious patterns. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is benign and standard.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- The current scores accurately reflect the security posture.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the scores as-is:  \n- **malware**: 0  \n- **obfuscated**: 0  \n- **risk**: 0",
