{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for handling unknown features and unused primitives.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static and do not process external data.",
  "inks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no potential for data leak or system impact.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only defines classes without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates two custom classes: UnknownFeature, a subclass of Exception, which customizes the initialization; and UnusedPrimitiveWarning, a subclass of UserWarning, acting as a marker for warnings. Both are simple class definitions without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. No external data handling, security-sensitive operations, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as part of a larger application to handle specific exception and warning cases. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
