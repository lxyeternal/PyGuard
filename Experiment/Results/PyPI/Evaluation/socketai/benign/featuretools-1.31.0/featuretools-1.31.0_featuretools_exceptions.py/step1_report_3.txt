  "purpose": "Defines custom exception and warning classes for handling unknown features and unused primitives.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__ methods) and class declarations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows related to untrusted input; code only defines classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simple definitions without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or suspicious code patterns. The classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two class definitions: one for a custom exception (UnknownFeature) and one for a user warning (UnusedPrimitiveWarning). Both are standard in Python and do not involve any input/output operations, data handling, or external dependencies. The custom exception class calls the base Exception constructor, and the warning class inherits directly from UserWarning with no additional logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign Python snippet that defines custom exception and warning classes. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
