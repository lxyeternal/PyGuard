  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines two classes:\n  - `UnknownFeature` inheriting from `Exception`, with a custom `__init__` that calls the base constructor.\n  - `UnusedPrimitiveWarning` inheriting from `UserWarning`.\n- Both classes are straightforward, standard class definitions with no complex logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and adheres to Python conventions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, obfuscation, or malicious side effects.\n- **Data flow:** No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.\n- **External interactions:** None; no I/O, network, or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Purpose:** The classes are utility constructs for error and warning handling, likely part of a larger application.\n\n### Review of each report:\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- They assign a confidence of 1, with no obfuscation or malware detected.\n- All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Logical consistency:\n- The reasoning is sound: simple class definitions with no external data or complex logic.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent, which aligns with the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in each report seem reasonable and consistent.\n- The `malware` score should remain at 0.\n- The `obfuscated` score should remain at 0.\n- The `securityRisk` should remain at 0.\n- The confidence score of 1 is justified given the clear and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is purely utility class definitions with no security concerns.\n- No adjustments needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
