{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception and warning classes for use in other Python code.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output; no potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The classes are simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom classes: UnknownFeature inheriting from Exception and UnusedPrimitiveWarning inheriting from UserWarning. Both are straightforward class definitions with no complex logic, data handling, or external interactions. No input/output, no network connections, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python module defining custom exception and warning classes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
