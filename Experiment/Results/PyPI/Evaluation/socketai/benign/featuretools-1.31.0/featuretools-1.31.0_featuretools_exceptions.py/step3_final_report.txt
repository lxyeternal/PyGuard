  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for use in larger Python applications.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; __init__ method in UnknownFeature, class inheritance declarations.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation flows; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple classes: UnknownFeature (a custom exception) and UnusedPrimitiveWarning (a custom warning). Both are standard Python constructs with no dynamic behavior, external interactions, or obfuscation. The __init__ method in UnknownFeature correctly calls the base constructor. No malicious, suspicious, or security-related code is present. The code is benign, with no data leaks, code injection, or obfuscation. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence is high (1) given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
