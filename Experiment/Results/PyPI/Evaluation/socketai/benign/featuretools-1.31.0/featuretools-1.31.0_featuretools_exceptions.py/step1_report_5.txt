{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for handling unknown features and unused primitives",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading operations present",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output involved",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code only contains class definitions inheriting from built-in exception and warning classes. The __init__ method in UnknownFeature properly calls the base class constructor. No input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and serves to define custom exceptions and warnings without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
