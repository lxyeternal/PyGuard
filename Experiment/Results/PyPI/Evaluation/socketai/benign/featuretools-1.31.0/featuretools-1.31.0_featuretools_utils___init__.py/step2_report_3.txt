  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\n# flake8: noqa\nfrom featuretools.utils.api import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a wildcard import from a known open-source library (`featuretools`), which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential security risks.\n- The snippet itself contains no malicious code, data processing, or obfuscated logic.\n- Wildcard imports can hide what functions or classes are being imported, which could be exploited if the source module is compromised or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions/classes, possibly for utility or API functions.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `*` import, which can hide malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No direct evidence of malicious activity; risk is mainly from the import style.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, acknowledging style issue).\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No malware, but the style poses maintainability/security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, utility functions.\n- **Anomalies:** `import *`, standard dependency.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just a style concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No malware, minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for API operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import, potential for obscured functions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Use utility functions for API-related operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions/variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code snippet, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, reflecting style concerns rather than actual security threats.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which is a style and maintainability issue but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence suggests any malware or obfuscation in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to style and potential namespace pollution)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is benign but employs a poor practice (wildcard import). No changes needed unless considering stricter security policies, which would flag wildcard imports more severely.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a benign code snippet with style concerns rather than security threats.",
