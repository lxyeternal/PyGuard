  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the context provided.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\n# flake8: noqa\nfrom featuretools.utils.api import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a wildcard import from a known open-source library (`featuretools`).\n- Wildcard imports are discouraged because they obscure which functions/classes are imported, making code harder to read and maintain.\n- No evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic is present.\n- The import alone does not indicate malicious activity; the risk depends on how the imported symbols are used downstream.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the wildcard import and its risks. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to wildcard import)\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, acknowledges the wildcard import and its risks. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes the potential for obscured functions and the general risk of wildcard imports. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, highlights the risk of wildcard import but finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same reasoning, notes the risks but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statement.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting the risk of wildcard imports but not indicating a serious security concern.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable given the limited code context.\n- Wildcard imports are generally discouraged but are not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence suggests the imported module is compromised or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to use of wildcard import but no active threat)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The use of wildcard import is a poor practice but not malicious in itself. The scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n**No further action or score adjustments are necessary based on this snippet.**",
