  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports focus on a single line: `from featuretools.utils.api import *`\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: importing utility functions/classes from the featuretools library.\n- Common concerns include the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code.\n- No actual code execution, data handling, or suspicious behaviors are demonstrated.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting the concern about import practices rather than actual malicious intent.\n- Confidence levels are moderate to high (0.7–0.8), mostly based on the import style rather than concrete malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code snippet itself does not contain malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.\n- The wildcard import can be a security and maintainability concern but does not equate to malware or malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the risks of wildcard imports but do not overstate the threat.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about malicious activity are made.\n- The reasoning is sound: the import style is discouraged but not inherently dangerous.\n\n### Scores review:\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- Obfuscated: 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- Security risk: Slightly higher (0.2) due to the wildcard import concern, which is reasonable.\n- Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code snippet.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The reports do not claim malicious activity without evidence, which is appropriate.\n- The primary concern is code clarity and maintainability, not security breach.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to poor import practice but not malicious)\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the evidence, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe use of wildcard import is a known bad practice but does not constitute an attack vector or malicious activity by itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is a simple import statement with a wildcard, which poses maintainability and security concerns but shows no signs of malware or obfuscation. The reports' scores are aligned with this understanding, and I concur with their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Encourage replacing `import *` with explicit imports for clarity.\n- No further security action needed based on this snippet alone.",
