  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; import may bring in external code to be used elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and reduced code clarity, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that brings in all definitions from featuretools.utils.api. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data handling, no external network activity, or code execution. The wildcard import could potentially include malicious or vulnerable code if the source module is compromised, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code only performs a standard import operation with a wildcard, which is not inherently malicious but can pose maintainability and security risks if the imported module is compromised. No malware or malicious intent is apparent in this snippet.",
