  "purpose": "Import all functions/classes from featuretools.utils.api, likely for utility or API purposes.",
  "sources": "The line 'from featuretools.utils.api import *' reads data from the featuretools library module.",
  "sinks": "The imported symbols could be used downstream without explicit control, but no direct sink (e.g., network, file, or sensitive data leak) is evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the featuretools.utils.api module into the current namespace; no external or untrusted data flow is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') is a concern for namespace pollution and maintainability, but no malicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from a known open-source library, which is discouraged but not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present. The import style poses maintainability issues but does not constitute a security threat. Scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, with confidence around 0.8. The overall risk is low, and the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a straightforward wildcard import from a reputable library, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is code style and maintainability, not security. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
