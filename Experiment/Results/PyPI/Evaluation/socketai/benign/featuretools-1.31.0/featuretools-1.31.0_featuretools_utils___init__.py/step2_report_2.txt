  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\n# flake8: noqa\nfrom featuretools.utils.api import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a wildcard import (`import *`) from a known open-source library (`featuretools`).\n- The import is accompanied by a flake8 directive to ignore style warnings, which is common when wildcard imports are used.\n- No other code, data handling, or suspicious behavior is shown.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the wildcard import and its potential for obscuring imported functions. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk is low (0.2), reflecting the general concern with wildcard imports.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the import's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score at 0 is appropriate. Security risk is low, considering the minimal code.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates the potential risks of wildcard imports but notes that the source is a legitimate open-source library, which reduces suspicion.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0, which is consistent. Security risk at 0.2 is reasonable given the wildcard import practice.\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizing the use of a well-known library and the risks of wildcard imports.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score at 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate; no change.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar reasoning, highlighting the risks but noting the legitimacy of the source.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score at 0 is justified; the security risk remains low.\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated (around 0.2), reflecting the general concern with wildcard imports but not indicating high risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Should stay at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Could be slightly lowered to 0.1 in some cases, given the lack of malicious activity, but 0.2 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to wildcard import practice, but no actual malicious behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scoring is reasonable and justified. No significant changes are necessary based on the provided code snippet and analysis.",
