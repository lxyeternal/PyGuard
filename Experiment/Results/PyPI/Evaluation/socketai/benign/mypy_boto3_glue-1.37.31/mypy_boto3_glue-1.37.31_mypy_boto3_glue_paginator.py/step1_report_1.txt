{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and pagination classes for AWS Glue service client in boto3, enabling type-checked iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and function definitions, import statements, and type annotations. It also references data types for request and response structures imported from other modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain direct data sinks, such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks. It primarily defines classes and method signatures for pagination.",
  "flows": "The class methods (paginate) receive parameters via **kwargs and return PageIterator objects. These flows are typical for boto3 paginators, with no untrusted data sources or insecure data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names are present. The code strictly defines type annotations and class structures for paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, type-annotated set of paginator classes for AWS Glue, generated with careful consideration of type safety and documentation links. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code relies on standard boto3 and typing extensions, with no dynamic or unsafe behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotation and pagination interface definitions for AWS Glue SDK via boto3. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be an official or semi-official stub implementation intended to improve type safety.",
