  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Glue service in boto3, serving as SDK stubs for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Class methods 'paginate' accepting **kwargs, importing type definitions, and class constructors calling 'client.get_paginator'.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods pass **kwargs directly into boto3's paginator.paginate() without validation, but this is standard for SDK wrappers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (**kwargs) flow into boto3's paginator.paginate(), with responses returned as PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK stub style.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations, importing response and request types, and methods that delegate to boto3's paginator. No external data sources or untrusted data processing occurs. Passing **kwargs directly is typical for SDK wrappers, not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code is static, well-structured, and intended for type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated set of type-annotated classes for AWS Glue paginators, with no malicious or security concerns.",
