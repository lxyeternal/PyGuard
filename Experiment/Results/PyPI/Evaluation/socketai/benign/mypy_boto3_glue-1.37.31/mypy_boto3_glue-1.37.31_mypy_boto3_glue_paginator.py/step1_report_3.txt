{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Glue service client, providing type-safe access to paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded module imports, type definitions, and class/method definitions. No external untrusted data sources or user inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data, network communication, or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources leading to sinks; all code consists of class definitions and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is structured for type safety with standard Python and boto3 patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes for AWS Glue, utilizing Python's type annotations and generics. It includes conditional imports for typing extensions, and systematically creates subclasses that override the 'paginate' method, which simply forwards the call with unpacked keyword arguments. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling is present. All patterns follow standard library and SDK practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of boto3 paginator type annotations and classes. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, representing typical SDK type stubs with no security risks.",
