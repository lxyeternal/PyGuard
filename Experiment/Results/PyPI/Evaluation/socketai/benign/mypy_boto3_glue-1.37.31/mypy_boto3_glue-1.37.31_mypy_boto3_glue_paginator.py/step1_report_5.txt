{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Glue service client, providing typed paginator interfaces for various Glue operations.",
  "sources": "Code reads only from predefined classes, methods, and type definitions; no external input sources or user data are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or data leak points identified; the code primarily defines classes and method signatures without performing data output or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines paginator classes with their methods, without executing any dynamic or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors observed. The code is structurally consistent with auto-generated type annotations. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present; the code is straightforward class and method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Glue paginators, including proper use of generics, conditional imports for compatibility, and well-documented method signatures. It relies on standard boto3 and typing libraries, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate code for type stubs, with no runtime or network operations. It does not read untrusted input nor write to external sinks. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious code snippets. The structure is clear, and the purpose is solely for type hinting and interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for Glue paginator interfaces, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be an auto-generated or documentation-oriented module intended to aid static type checking.",
