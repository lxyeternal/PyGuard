  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Glue service, enabling type-checked interactions with the AWS Glue API in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, AWS SDK components (botocore, boto3), and various type definitions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that perform API calls to AWS Glue, passing parameters and returning responses or exceptions.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input parameters (via **kwargs) flow into API calls, and responses or exceptions flow back to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is predominantly interface/typing definitions with no runtime logic or external network operations embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations, client class structure, exception types, method signatures, and overloads for paginator creation. All operations align with AWS SDK standards for a service client, with no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The extensive use of type annotations and method definitions suggests this is a type stub implementation or interface, not runtime executable logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured type stub/interface for the AWS Glue SDK in Python, focusing on type safety and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate, security-focused SDK interface definition.",
