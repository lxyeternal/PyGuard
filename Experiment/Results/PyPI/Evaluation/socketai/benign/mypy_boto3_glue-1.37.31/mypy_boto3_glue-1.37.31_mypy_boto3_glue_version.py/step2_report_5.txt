  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are observed.\n- The code is standard for package metadata declaration.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the copyright year being in the future (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n**Presence of Issues:**  \n- The code is straightforward and contains only a version string assignment. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**Errors or Flaws in Reports:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n\n- **malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **securityRisk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **obfuscated score:** All assign 0, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The only anomaly is the future year (2025). This is not a security concern but might be a typo or placeholder. The reports correctly dismiss this as minor and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware and Security Risk:**  \n  The scores are correctly set to 0. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is transparent; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The overall risk is negligible, and scores reflect that.\n\n- **Future Year (2025):**  \n  While unusual, it does not impact security. The reports correctly identify it as a minor anomaly.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues. The only minor anomaly (future year) does not warrant concern. The current scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that version files are kept up-to-date and accurate, but from a security perspective, this code is safe.",
