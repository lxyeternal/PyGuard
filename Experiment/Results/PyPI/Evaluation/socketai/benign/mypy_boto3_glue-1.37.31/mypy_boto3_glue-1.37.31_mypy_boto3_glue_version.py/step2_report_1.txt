  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe a very simple version assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.31\"`.\n- There are no external data flows, code execution, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward assignment of a version string.\n- **Malicious activity:** No report indicates any malicious code, payload, or suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is not obfuscated; all reports agree on this.\n- **Security risk:** Given the simplicity, the risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only anomaly is the copyright year being in the future (2025). While unusual, it doesn't pose a security risk. It might be a typo or placeholder.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n- The risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- Confidence is 1, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** No changes needed; all scores are reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk/malware scores:** Since there's no malicious code, the scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Future copyright year:** While it may be a typo, it doesn't impact security; thus, it doesn't affect the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration. The reports are consistent, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity or security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code remains a benign, straightforward version declaration with no security implications.",
