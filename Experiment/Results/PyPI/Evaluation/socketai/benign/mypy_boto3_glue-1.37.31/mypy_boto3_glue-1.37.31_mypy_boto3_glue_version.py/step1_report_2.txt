  "purpose": "Define and store the version number of the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the __version__ variable with a static string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright comment with a future year (2025) which may be a typo or deliberate placeholder; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a version string for the package and includes a copyright statement. There are no input or output data flows, no code execution, no external data fetching, or sensitive information handling. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year being in the future (2025), which could be a typo or placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard for version definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a basic version identifier with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not suspicious.",
