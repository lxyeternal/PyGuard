  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes a comment about the source of truth, a copyright notice, and a version string assignment. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, and no malicious constructs. The version string is hardcoded but benign, serving as metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard practice for defining package metadata.",
