  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only version info with a copyright statement. No suspicious code, no external data reading, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and includes a copyright comment. No data input, no external file access, no network activity, or code execution. The version string appears standard. The copyright year is set to 2025, which is a future date relative to the current year, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n\nThe code is straightforward and appears to serve as a simple metadata declaration. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign version declaration with no malicious or security-related concerns. The code's purpose is purely to define the package version. No suspicious activity detected.",
