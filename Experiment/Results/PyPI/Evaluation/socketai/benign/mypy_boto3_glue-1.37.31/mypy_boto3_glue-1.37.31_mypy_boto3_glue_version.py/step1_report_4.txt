  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring and a single variable assignment setting __version__ to '1.37.31'. The docstring states it's the source of truth for version, and the assignment is straightforward. No input handling, data processing, or suspicious code structures are present. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
