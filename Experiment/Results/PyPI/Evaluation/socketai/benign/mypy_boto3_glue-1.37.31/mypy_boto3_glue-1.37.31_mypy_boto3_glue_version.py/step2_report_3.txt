  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.31\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues:\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration, assigning a static string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, no data flows, no code execution, no network activity.\n- The only notable aspect is the copyright year being in the future (2025).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities present. The code is a standard practice for package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- *Summary:* No anomalies, straightforward assignment, no malicious intent.  \n- *Score:* malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0  \n- *Assessment:* Correct. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- *Summary:* Future year (2025) might be a typo or placeholder, but not malicious.  \n- *Score:* malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0  \n- *Assessment:* Correct. The future date is not a security concern but could be flagged as a minor anomaly. No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- *Summary:* Simple assignment, no data flow, no anomalies.  \n- *Score:* malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0  \n- *Assessment:* Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- *Summary:* Only a version string assignment and a docstring. No suspicious behavior.  \n- *Score:* malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0  \n- *Assessment:* Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- *Summary:* Similar to others; minimal code, no external interactions, benign.  \n- *Score:* malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0  \n- *Assessment:* Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- Risk score is appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, given no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always keep an eye on future copyright years, but in this context, it does not impact security.",
