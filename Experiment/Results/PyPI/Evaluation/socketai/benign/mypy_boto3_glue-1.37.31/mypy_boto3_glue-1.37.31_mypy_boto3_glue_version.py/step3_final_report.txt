  "purpose": "A simple version string declaration serving as the source of truth for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '__version__ = \"1.37.31\"' and the module docstring.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data inputs or outputs; no untrusted data flows or network interactions.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, with no data flow to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future and likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static assignment of a version string with an accompanying docstring. No malicious code, obfuscation, or data flows are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and standard. No suspicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity. The only noted anomaly (future year) is not a security issue.",
