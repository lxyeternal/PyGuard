  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external data sources, no code execution, no data flows, and no suspicious code behavior are identified.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and findings:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is straightforward and correct: `__version__ = \"1.37.31\"`.\n   - No errors, flaws, or malicious code are present.\n   - No data flows, external inputs, or outputs are involved.\n   - The code is standard for package metadata.\n\n2. **Anomalies:**\n   - The only anomaly noted is the future year (2025). This is not suspicious but could be a typo or placeholder.\n   - No other anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation, are present.\n\n3. **Malware and security risks:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores and reasoning:**\n   - The scores assigned in each report seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No report suggests a higher risk than warranted.\n   - Since the code is purely metadata with no malicious or suspicious behavior, all scores are appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Is there any reason to increase the malware score?**  \n  No. The code contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Is the risk score justified?**  \n  Yes, at 0, as the code is benign.\n\n- **Are the explanations and conclusions valid?**  \n  Yes, they are consistent and well-justified.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No, all reports are aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThe only potential point is the future year (2025). If desired, it could be flagged as a typo, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**The code is a simple, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues.**  \n**Scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.**  \n**No modifications needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**This aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.**",
