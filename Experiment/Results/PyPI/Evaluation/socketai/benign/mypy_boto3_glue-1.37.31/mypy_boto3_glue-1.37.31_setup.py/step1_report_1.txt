  "purpose": "This setup script defines the configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-glue' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports from standard libraries and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static data assignments and package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, using well-known modules and conventions. It reads static metadata and package data, with no input/output operations involving external data sources or untrusted inputs. No code injections, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The license and author information are standard, and no runtime or network activities are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
