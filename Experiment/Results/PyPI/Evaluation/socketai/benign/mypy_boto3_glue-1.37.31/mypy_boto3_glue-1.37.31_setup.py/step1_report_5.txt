  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-glue package, providing metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data outputs or network operations occur in this script.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content for description; processes package setup data without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the description and configures package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, network communication, or runtime code execution that could be malicious is present. The code appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration file with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely configures package distribution parameters and dependencies without performing any unsafe operations.",
