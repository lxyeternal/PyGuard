{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-glue', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or inputs processed that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content (README.md) and supplies package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The script follows standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, no use of environment variables for sensitive data, and no network connections or other suspicious activities. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The use of static metadata and file reading is typical and safe.",
