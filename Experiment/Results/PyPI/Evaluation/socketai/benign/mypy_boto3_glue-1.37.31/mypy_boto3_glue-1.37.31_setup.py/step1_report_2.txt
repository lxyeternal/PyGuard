  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The URL and email appear legitimate; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and defines package setup metadata using setuptools. It specifies package details, URLs, author info, dependencies, and classifiers. All code appears typical for a Python package setup script. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the code does not execute external commands or process untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package.",
