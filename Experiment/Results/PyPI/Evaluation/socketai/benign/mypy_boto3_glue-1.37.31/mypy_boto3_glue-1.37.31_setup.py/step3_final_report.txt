  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-glue, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static files (README.md), standard modules (pathlib), and package metadata within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; all data is static and confined within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows common packaging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, reading a local README.md for description, and specifying package info, dependencies, and URLs. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external command execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero with high confidence. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The scores are consistent with the static, well-understood nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
