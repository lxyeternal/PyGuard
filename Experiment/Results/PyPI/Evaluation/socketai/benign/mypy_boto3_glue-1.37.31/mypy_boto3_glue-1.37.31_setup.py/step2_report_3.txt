  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard, benign Python setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or network activities are present.\n- The code only reads static files and defines package metadata.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches typical `setup.py` patterns; no issues with the logic or syntax.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no network, file, or command execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; static configuration only.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard package setup, no security risks.\n\nAll reports assign maximum confidence (1.0) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scoring in the reports is appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications needed; the reports accurately reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Conclusion:** The setup script poses no security threat and functions solely as a package configuration file.",
