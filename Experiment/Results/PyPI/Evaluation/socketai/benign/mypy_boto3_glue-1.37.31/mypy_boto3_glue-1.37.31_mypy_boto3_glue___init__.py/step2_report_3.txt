  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its structure, and the provided evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward SDK wrapper, importing classes and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data are present.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious or obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion is appropriate; the confidence level is justified at 1.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk: 0 (benign SDK wrapper)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the standard nature of the code.\n- No external data handling, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- The class aliasing (`Client = GlueClient`) is benign.\n- The confidence is justified at 1.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Also describes the code as a standard SDK wrapper.\n- No signs of malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscated code.\n- The aliasing and imports are typical.\n- Confidence level is justified at 1.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, correctly identifies the code as a typical interface layer.\n- No suspicious logic, no external data, no dynamic code.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Also correctly states that the code is a standard SDK wrapper.\n- No malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- The structure is straightforward.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a benign, standard SDK wrapper with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk features. The provided scores (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional note:** Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious patterns, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a benign, well-structured SDK wrapper module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
