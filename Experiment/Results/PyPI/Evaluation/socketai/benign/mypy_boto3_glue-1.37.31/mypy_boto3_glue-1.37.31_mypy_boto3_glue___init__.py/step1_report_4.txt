{
  "purpose": "This module provides a main interface and re-exports for the AWS Glue service client and its associated paginators, facilitating easy access to various AWS Glue API operations and paginators.",
  "sources": "The code defines imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), sets a class alias, and defines an __all__ list for export. It does not read external data or user input directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code. There are no functions or statements that process untrusted data or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input leading to sensitive operations. The code primarily sets up class references and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward module re-exporting and class aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and paginators related to AWS Glue, assigns a class alias, and defines an export list. It appears to be a standard module setup without any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as a straightforward interface layer for AWS Glue clients and paginators. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is clean, standard, and safe for use.",
