{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module for interfacing with the AWS Glue service, providing imports, class definitions, and exports for various paginator classes and a client class.",
  "sources": "The code imports from local modules: .client and .paginator, and defines a class alias.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sink that processes untrusted data or executes untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily consists of class definitions and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The class alias assignment ('Client = GlueClient') is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and functions, defines an alias, and exports these components via __all__. It includes a detailed docstring with usage examples. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or system commands are present. The import paths and class aliasing are standard patterns for modular code organization. The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or contain any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured Python module for AWS Glue SDK wrappers. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, and no security risks. It is safe and intended for library use.",
