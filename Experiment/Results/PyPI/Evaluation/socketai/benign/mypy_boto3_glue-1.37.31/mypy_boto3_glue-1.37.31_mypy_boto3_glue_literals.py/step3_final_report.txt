  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS Glue literal values used for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Defined string literals and type aliases within the module; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static definitions serve only for type annotations, not runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static type aliases do not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal for various AWS Glue and related service constants. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is standard. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data interactions, network calls, or runtime logic. No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The purpose is purely for static type safety, with no security or malicious implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of type aliases for AWS Glue literals, with no malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It is intended solely for type checking and code clarity.",
