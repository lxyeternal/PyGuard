  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS Glue and related services; sources are standard modules and static definitions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data output; purely static type definitions.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign static type alias module, intended for static type checking, with no malicious behavior or security issues.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature and purpose for type safety.  \n- No external data, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward, no security risks.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Reiterates the static, non-executable nature of the code, with no data flow or external interactions.  \n- No malicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Static type definitions, benign, no security concerns.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same pattern: static literals, no external input or output, no malicious logic.  \n- No signs of sabotage or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely for type annotations.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Emphasizes the static, declarative nature, with no runtime or external data handling.  \n- No suspicious patterns or malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely for static type safety.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a large collection of static string literal type definitions used for type annotations in Python, specifically for AWS Glue and related services.  \n- **Behavior & Risks:** The code does not perform any runtime logic, external data access, network communication, or execute any untrusted code.  \n- **Malicious Indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- **Security & Malware Scores:** All reports assign malware risk as 0, which is consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, static, and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any dynamic behavior, external interactions, or secrets, the overall security risk is negligible. I would assign a **risk score of 0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a static, well-structured set of type alias definitions for AWS Glue literals. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no external data interactions. The purpose is purely to enhance static type checking and code clarity. The provided reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and benign.",
