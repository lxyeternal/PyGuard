  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\nAll five reports agree that:\n- The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using `Literal` for AWS Glue and related AWS service constants.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking, improve code clarity, and enforce value constraints.\n- The code conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, network activity, or I/O operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n- The code is well-structured, static, and intended purely for type annotation purposes.\n\n**Technical observations:**\n\n- The code only defines string literal types for various AWS resource names, statuses, options, and enums.\n- The import pattern for `Literal` is standard and safe.\n- No external dependencies or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The purpose aligns with common SDK or type declaration files.\n\n**Security assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** The reports consistently indicate no malicious activity or behavior. The code is purely static and declarative.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are used.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Since the code contains no runtime logic, no external interactions, and only static type annotations, the security risk is negligible. The highest possible score here is 0.0, indicating no security concern.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- The purpose is purely to improve type safety in static analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n| Metric            | Score / Explanation                                              |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**      | 0.0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.                   |\n| **Obfuscated**   | 0.0 — Clear, straightforward static type definitions.           |\n| **Risk**         | 0.0 — No security risk; purely static, type annotation code.   |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a safe, static type declaration module for AWS Glue literals. It poses no security threat, malware, or obfuscation concerns. It is a standard pattern for type safety in Python projects, with no malicious activity or security issues detected.",
