{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Glue and related services, used for type annotations and validation.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to type aliases, imported modules such as sys and typing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard pattern of defining Literal types. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional import is normal. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a comprehensive set of string literal types for AWS Glue and AWS services. The conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version is appropriate. All definitions are static, compile-time string literals used for type annotations. No dynamic execution, external data reading, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type definitions module intended for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS Glue literals. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no external interactions. It is consistent with typical type annotation patterns in Python projects.",
