{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations for various string literals used as constants or enumerations in the AWS Glue SDK, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports modules and defines constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive literal definitions, which are typical in SDKs for enum-like values. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', then defines a large set of type aliases using 'Literal' for various AWS Glue and related services. All constants are string literals representing valid AWS resource types, statuses, and configuration options. There is no input processing, no external data handling, and no runtime logic. The file is a comprehensive, static collection of type annotations intended for type checking and IDE support. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'Literal' for enum-like values is standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS Glue SDK literals. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely as a type annotation utility, with no malicious intent or security threats.",
