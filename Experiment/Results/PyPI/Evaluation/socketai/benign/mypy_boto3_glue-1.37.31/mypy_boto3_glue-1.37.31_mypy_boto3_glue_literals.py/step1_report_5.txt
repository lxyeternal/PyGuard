{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various literal string values used in AWS Glue service and related dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import of sys, the version check for importing Literal, and the definitions of numerous Literal types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only defines type annotations without processing untrusted data or executing input/output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely provides static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an extensive list of string literals for type annotations but no suspicious or unusual patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The script checks Python version to conditionally import 'Literal' from the correct module, then proceeds to define multiple type aliases using 'Literal' for AWS Glue related constants and enums. All content consists of static type annotations with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. The purpose appears solely to facilitate type checking in client code. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or obfuscation are detected. The structure and content are consistent with standard type declaration files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static type alias definition module for AWS Glue literals. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious behavior. It is a benign, purely declarative script intended to aid static analysis and type safety.",
