{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for various string literals used in the AWS Glue service, primarily for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import 'sys' and the conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It also defines many string literal types.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any untrusted data input, external network calls, file I/O, or execution of dynamic code. It merely defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type aliases for literals.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The license and author info are benign. The code's structure is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. It then declares many type alias constants as string literals for use in type annotations. The structure is static, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or I/O. No obfuscation, malicious functions, or unusual behaviors are present. The purpose appears solely to provide type safety and better code documentation for AWS Glue literals. The license and author info are benign. Overall, the code is a straightforward declaration module with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type definitions module for AWS Glue literals, with no malicious behavior or security issues. It serves only to improve type safety in client code. No risks or malicious activity are detected.",
