  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\nAll five reports uniformly conclude that this code is a static, benign module defining string literal types for AWS Glue and related AWS services. They emphasize that:\n\n- The code imports standard modules (`sys`, `typing`) and conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version.\n- It defines numerous type aliases as string literals, serving as type annotations for static type checking.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no runtime logic, no external data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate code clarity, type safety, and IDE support.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, secrets, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Concerns:\n\n- **Code behavior:** The code is purely static type definitions. No dynamic code, no external I/O, no data processing.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Data leaks or external interactions:** Absent. No network, file, or input/output operations.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about untrusted data, nor are there any runtime evaluations or code injections.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — static, safe, and purpose-specific; no security risk.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\nThe code is a standard, static type alias module used for type checking in Python projects involving AWS Glue. It is well-structured, compatible, and contains no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **No changes needed** for the scores; they are appropriate.\n- **Justify high scores:** None needed, as all evidence points to benign, static code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a safe, benign, static type definitions module with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Please let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or have additional reports to review.**",
