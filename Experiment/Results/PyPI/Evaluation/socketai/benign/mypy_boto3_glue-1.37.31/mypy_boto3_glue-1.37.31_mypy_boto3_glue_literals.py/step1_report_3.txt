{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations using Literal types for various constants related to AWS Glue and other AWS services, aimed at type checking in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported 'sys' module and from the type annotations defined as string literals.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects. The code only defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the literals are static definitions for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code strictly defines static type literals and conditional import logic based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines numerous Literal type aliases for various AWS Glue and AWS service related constants, such as resource names, statuses, types, and options. All these definitions are static and do not process or execute any external or untrusted data. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose appears to be to facilitate static type checking with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static definition of type annotations for AWS Glue and related services. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose and contains no suspicious or anomalous code.",
