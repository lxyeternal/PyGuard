  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a static, benign module defining string literal types for AWS Glue and related services.\n- They highlight that the code:\n  - Uses conditional import for `Literal` based on Python version.\n  - Contains extensive, static string literal type aliases for enums and constants.\n  - Has no data processing, external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n  - Contains no hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n  - Serves solely for static type checking, improving code clarity and safety.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining type aliases.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No external data or network activity.\n- No obfuscation or malicious logic.\n- The conditional import pattern is standard for compatibility.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n\n- The only unusual aspect might be the extensive list of string literals, but this is typical for SDKs and type annotations.\n- No signs of code injection, dynamic execution, or external interactions.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerability present.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\nThe code is a benign, static type definition module. It provides type safety for AWS Glue literals without any malicious intent, security risk, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The provided scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware and risk.\n- The confidence level is high (1), given the consistent analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a standard, safe, static type annotations module for AWS Glue literals with no security concerns.**",
