  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that outputs package info and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout, sys.argv is read for command control",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and outputs version info; otherwise, outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code simply outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that prints package-related information. It reads command-line input via sys.argv to determine whether to display version info or package details. The output is directed to stdout. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or sensitive data processing occurs. The code is minimal, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script intended for informational purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
