  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \n- The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument.  \n- No dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, no obfuscated code, no secrets, no malicious payloads.  \n- All reports agree on this point.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning.**  \n- The reports are consistent: they correctly identify the script as benign, straightforward, and without malicious behavior.  \n- No flawed reasoning detected.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- All reports assign:  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0  \n  - Malware: 0.0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.0  \n  - Confidence: 1.0 (or very close)  \n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \n- No issues warrant a higher risk score. The code is purely informational, with no vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score.**  \n- All reports correctly assign malware score 0.0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions.**  \n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions, stating the code is static and benign.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency between scores and report content.**  \n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0.0  \n- No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n- Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.0  \n- No security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is a minimal CLI utility, safe and benign.  \n- All reports agree, and their reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
