{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 Glue stubs.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are sent to stdout via sys.stdout.write; no untrusted input is used for critical operations or security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in sys.argv, the code calls print_version() and outputs the version; otherwise, it calls print_info() and outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for standard input/output handling. It defines functions to print static package info and version details. The main() function checks for a specific command-line argument '--version' and conditionally outputs version info or general package info. The script runs main() when executed directly. All data outputs are static strings, and there are no sources or sinks involving untrusted input or external data streams. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package and version information. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use.",
