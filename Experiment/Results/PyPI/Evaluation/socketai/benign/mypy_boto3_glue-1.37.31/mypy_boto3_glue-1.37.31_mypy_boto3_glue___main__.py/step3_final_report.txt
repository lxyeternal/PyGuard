  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version number based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line input",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to output version or info via sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static data, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no secrets or external data sources",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that checks for '--version' argument and outputs static package info or version. It uses sys.argv for input and sys.stdout.write for output. No external data, dynamic code, or sensitive data handling. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The logic is simple and static, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. The code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static informational CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward code. The scores of malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified as zero. No further action or modification is necessary.",
