  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a metadata header containing licensing comments and a version string.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or data processing is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n- The code snippets are purely static comments and a simple variable assignment (`__version__ = \"2.19.2\"`).\n- There are no sinks, flows, or data that could be exploited.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as metadata, a standard practice in open-source projects.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- None of the reports identify any anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is consistent and sound.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code is a standard license and version header with no security concerns.",
