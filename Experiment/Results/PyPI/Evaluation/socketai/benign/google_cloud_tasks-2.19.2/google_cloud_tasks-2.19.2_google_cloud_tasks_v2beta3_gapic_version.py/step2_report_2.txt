  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their conclusions, as well as the scoring assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static header with licensing comments and a version string.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is purely metadata, serving as a header or version annotation.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippet contains only comments and a single assignment to `__version__`.\n   - No executable logic, no data flows, no external interactions.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata, and licensing information.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **No errors found.**\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n   - **Scores seem reasonable and consistent.**\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is purely static metadata with no executable or malicious elements.\n   - **No justification needed for higher scores.**\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity is evident or implied.\n   - **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies or contradictions.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is standard license and version header, posing no security concern.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
