{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a metadata header for a Python package, providing licensing, version, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "The only sources are static comments, license headers, and a version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks—no data processing, input/output, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code contains only comments and a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is purely metadata with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license and version header, containing no executable logic or data handling. It does not read input, access environment variables, or perform any operations that could be malicious. There are no obfuscated elements or hidden code segments. Given the absence of dynamic code or external data processing, it cannot be considered malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign license header and version annotation with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as metadata for the package and contains no code that could be exploited or that performs any harmful actions.",
