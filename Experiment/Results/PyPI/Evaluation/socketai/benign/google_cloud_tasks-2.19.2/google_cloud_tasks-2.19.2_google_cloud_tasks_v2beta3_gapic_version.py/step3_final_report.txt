  "purpose": "Metadata header containing licensing information and versioning for the open-source package.",
  "sources": "Static comments, licensing headers, and a version string assignment (__version__ = \"2.19.2\").",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is static and contains only comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, non-executable nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license and version header with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risk and is entirely benign.",
