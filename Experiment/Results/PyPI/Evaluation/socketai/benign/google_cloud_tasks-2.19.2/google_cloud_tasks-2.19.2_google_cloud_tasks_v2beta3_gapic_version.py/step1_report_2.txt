  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns. The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard licensing header with a version assignment. No dynamic code, input handling, or data processing is present. It does not contain any code that could be malicious or suspicious. The only active statement is the assignment of a version string to __version__, which is a common practice in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely informational, serving as metadata for a Python package or module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
