  "purpose": "Metadata and licensing information for a Python package, including versioning and licensing details.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data; all lines are comments, licensing info, and a version variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only contains comments and a version string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version assignment. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or contain any code that could lead to malicious behavior. The version string is a static assignment with no dynamic or obfuscated code. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely informational, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate for open-source licensing and versioning.",
