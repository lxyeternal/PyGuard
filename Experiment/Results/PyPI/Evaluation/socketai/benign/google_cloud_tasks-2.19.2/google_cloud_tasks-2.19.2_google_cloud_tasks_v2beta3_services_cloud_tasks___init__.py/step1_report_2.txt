  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for a Google Cloud Tasks SDK, providing access to client classes for synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.async_client and .client), and the module's own __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions; the code only exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module imports and exports, with licensing comments and no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network operations. It is standard module setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script for a Python client library, containing no malicious code or security risks.",
