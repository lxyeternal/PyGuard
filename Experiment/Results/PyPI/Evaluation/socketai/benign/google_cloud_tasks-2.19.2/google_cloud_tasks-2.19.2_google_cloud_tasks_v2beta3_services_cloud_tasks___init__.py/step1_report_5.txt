  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for the Cloud Tasks client libraries, providing access to synchronous and asynchronous clients.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths; the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module export pattern with licensing comments. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module initialization file defining exports for a client library. It imports classes from local modules and specifies them in __all__. No input handling, no external data processing, and no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
