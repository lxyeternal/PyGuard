  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for a Python package 'google-cloud-tasks', defining dependencies, package metadata, and reading version info.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'google/cloud/tasks/gapic_version.py' and README content from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that execute untrusted code or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README content, then uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external communications are present. The code primarily performs file I/O and package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code reads version data from a specific Python file using regex, then reads a README file. It defines dependencies and package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() for package installation configuration. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or other risky behaviors are evident. The process appears to be standard for Python package setup, with no malicious intent or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It securely reads version info and package description, then configures package metadata for distribution. There are no anomalies or malicious signals detected.",
