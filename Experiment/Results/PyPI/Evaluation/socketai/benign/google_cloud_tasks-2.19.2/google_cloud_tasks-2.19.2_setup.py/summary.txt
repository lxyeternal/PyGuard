  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The slight overestimation of security risk in one report (score 0.1) is unjustified; it should be 0. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should be 0."
