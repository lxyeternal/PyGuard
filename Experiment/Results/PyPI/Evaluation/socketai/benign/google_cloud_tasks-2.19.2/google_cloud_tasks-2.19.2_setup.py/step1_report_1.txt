  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README content, then passes static data to setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. Uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info, loading README, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. All operations involve static file reads and data passing to setuptools without any dynamic code execution, input from external sources, or security-sensitive actions. No obfuscated code or malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
