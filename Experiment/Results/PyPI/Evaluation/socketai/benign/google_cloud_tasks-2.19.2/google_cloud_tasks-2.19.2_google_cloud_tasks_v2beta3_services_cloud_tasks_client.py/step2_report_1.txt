  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a client library for Google Cloud Tasks v2beta3.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard environment variables, request handling, API calls.\n- Anomalies: None detected; code is standard, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: The code is a typical, well-structured client library, handling credentials, environment configs, and API requests securely.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or security risks detected.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Error: Empty response, no data.\n- No analysis possible.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, describing a client library for Google Cloud Tasks.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard environment variables, credential handling, API request flows.\n- Anomalies: None; code follows typical patterns, no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- Analysis: Standard auto-generated Google Cloud client library, with secure credential and endpoint management.\n- Conclusion: No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, client library for Google Cloud Tasks.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard, with environment variables, request handling, API calls.\n- Anomalies: None detected; no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical, secure SDK code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or security risks.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar client library for Google Cloud Tasks.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard API request flow, environment variables, credential handling.\n- Anomalies: None; standard patterns, no suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Legitimate, well-structured client SDK, with no signs of malware or sabotage.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical, auto-generated Google Cloud SDK client library.\n- **Malware signals:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated segments, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** No evident risks; code handles credentials, environment configs, and API requests securely.\n- **Scores justification:** All reports consistently assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, standard, and auto-generated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard client library, no security issues.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, legitimate client SDK for Google Cloud Tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
