  "purpose": "This code appears to be a library module that provides access to Google Cloud Tasks API client classes and related data types, facilitating task management operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3 and local modules, defining __version__, and importing various request and type classes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution; the code primarily defines imports, constants, and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and re-exports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code contains licensing comments and straightforward import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module for client library setup, importing version info, classes, and types from a Google Cloud library. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign library module that facilitates interaction with Google Cloud Tasks API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a client SDK.",
