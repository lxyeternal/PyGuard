{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python client library module for Google Cloud Tasks, providing import statements, versioning, and export definitions for various classes and functions related to task management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3, local module imports, and version info from package_version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network communication, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static import and export setup; no runtime data flows or external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard license headers and import/export structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module primarily consisting of import statements, version info, and __all__ exports. It contains no data processing, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code functions as a boilerplate for a client SDK, with all indicators pointing to benign, standard structure. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
