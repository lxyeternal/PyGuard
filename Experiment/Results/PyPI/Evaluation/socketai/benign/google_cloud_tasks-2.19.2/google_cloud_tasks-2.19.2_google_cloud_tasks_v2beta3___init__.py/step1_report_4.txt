  "purpose": "This code defines and exports classes, functions, and data types for interfacing with Google Cloud Tasks API, facilitating task queue management and execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.tasks_v2beta3 and internal module attributes (e.g., package_version.__version__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are present in this code",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs observed; license headers are standard and non-malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version assignment, and __all__ declarations to expose API components. It imports specific classes and functions from a Google Cloud package and defines module exports. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present. The license headers and comments are standard boilerplate. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for a client library, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard Python module for Google Cloud Tasks API client setup. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and purely structural, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
