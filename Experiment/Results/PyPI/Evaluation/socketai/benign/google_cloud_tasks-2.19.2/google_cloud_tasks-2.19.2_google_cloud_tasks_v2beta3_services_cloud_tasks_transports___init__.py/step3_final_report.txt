  "purpose": "Registry setup for transport classes in a client library, importing classes and registering them in an ordered dictionary for later use.",
  "sources": "Local module imports and static class references.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of class references to a registry dictionary; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and static with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The code's simplicity and structure indicate a benign setup component. All signals point to safe, standard code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup module for registering transport classes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
