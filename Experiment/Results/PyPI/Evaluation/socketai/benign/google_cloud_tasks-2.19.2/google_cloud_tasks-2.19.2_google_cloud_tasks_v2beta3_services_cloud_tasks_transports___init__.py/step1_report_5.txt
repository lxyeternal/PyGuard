{
  "purpose": "The code defines a registry for different transport mechanisms for the Cloud Tasks service, including gRPC and REST transports, facilitating modular transport management.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and local modules; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, especially no untrusted data handling or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up class mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and conventional for a Python package component.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up an ordered dictionary to register transport classes, and defines a list of exported classes. There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. All code appears to be static and intended for internal registry purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical registry setup for transport classes in a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It appears safe and aligned with standard package structure.",
