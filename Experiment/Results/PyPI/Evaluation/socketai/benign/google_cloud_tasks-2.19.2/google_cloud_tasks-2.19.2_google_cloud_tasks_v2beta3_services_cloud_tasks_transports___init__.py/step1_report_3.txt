{
  "purpose": "This code defines a registry of transport classes for Cloud Tasks API, enabling selection among gRPC, async gRPC, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, class definitions, and a hardcoded ordered dictionary of transport types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data leaks are present. No sinks are identified that could lead to data exfiltration or system effects.",
  "flows": "The module imports are static, and the transport registry is assigned with class references. There are no dynamic flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. All code appears standard for a transport registry.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a static registry of transport classes, and exposes relevant classes via __all__. It appears to be a typical setup for managing transport options in a client library. No code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module establishing a registry of transport classes. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
