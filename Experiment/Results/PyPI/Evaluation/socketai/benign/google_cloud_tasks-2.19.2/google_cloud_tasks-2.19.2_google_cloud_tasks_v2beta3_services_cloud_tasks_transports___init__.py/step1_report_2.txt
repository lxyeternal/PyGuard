{
  "purpose": "Defines and registers transport classes for Google Cloud Tasks client, including gRPC and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (collections, typing), relative imports from the same package (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only sets up class registry.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and internal modules, then creates a registry of transport classes for use elsewhere. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or potential backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a typical module setup for a client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup module for transport classes in a Google Cloud client library. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It simply registers transport implementations for later use.",
