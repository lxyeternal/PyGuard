{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers different transport mechanisms for the CloudTasks API, including gRPC and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard Python libraries (collections, typing), local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), and static dictionary initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks are present; the code only sets up internal class references and an ordered dictionary.",
  "flows": "Imports → registry dictionary setup → registration of transport classes → export of symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and types, then compiles an ordered dictionary to register transport classes. It does not process external input, handle secrets, or perform network operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident. It appears to be a standard module setup for a client library, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module for transport registration in a client library, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It only defines and exports classes and a registry.",
