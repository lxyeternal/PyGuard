  "purpose": "This script evaluates Japanese morphological analysis output by comparing system results with reference answers, calculating precision, recall, and F-measure for word segmentation and POS tagging.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified via command-line arguments, processing each line to extract surface forms and POS tags.",
  "sinks": "Outputs evaluation metrics to standard output; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> processes data in memory -> computes metrics -> prints results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external connections detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O with UTF-8 encoding, processes data line-by-line, and calculates evaluation metrics. No external network or system calls are present. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The minimal file handling and output are typical for evaluation scripts, and no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard evaluation tool for Japanese morphological analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal file handling. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
