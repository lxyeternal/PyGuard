{
  "purpose": "This script evaluates the performance of a Japanese morphological analyzer by comparing system output with reference data, calculating precision, recall, and F-measure at word segmentation and POS-tagging levels.",
  "sources": "Input files specified via command line arguments ('--system' and '--answer'), read through the 'readFile' function which opens files with codecs and processes lines.",
  "sinks": "Data read from input files; no unsafe data handling or external connections; no data leaks or malicious data processing observed.",
  "flows": "User supplies file paths; 'readFile' reads and processes files; data flows into 'mecab_eval' for analysis; results are printed via 'print_eval'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present; code structure straightforward, focused on evaluation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file reading, data processing, and statistical calculations for evaluation metrics. It utilizes 'codecs.open' for UTF-8 handling, which is standard. No external network connections, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling, nor obfuscated segments. All functions serve legitimate evaluation purposes. The code is well-structured, with clear input, processing, and output steps. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate evaluation script for linguistic analysis with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. It solely processes input files for performance metrics without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
