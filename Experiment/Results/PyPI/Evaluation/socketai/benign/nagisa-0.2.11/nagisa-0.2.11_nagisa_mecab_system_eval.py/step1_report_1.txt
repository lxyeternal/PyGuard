  "purpose": "This script evaluates the performance of a word segmentation and POS-tagging system by comparing system output files against reference answer files.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified via command line arguments (--system, --answer). Uses codecs.open to read files with UTF-8 encoding.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or external system interactions beyond file reading and printing results.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> processes data in memory -> outputs evaluation metrics to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward data reading, comparison, and printing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines functions for reading files, evaluating segmentation/POS tagging, calculating F-values, and printing results. It uses command-line arguments to specify input files, reads UTF-8 encoded data, and performs a standard comparison. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or obfuscated constructs. The code is a typical evaluation script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard evaluation tool for NLP tasks without malicious or suspicious behavior. It only reads specified files and outputs metrics, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
