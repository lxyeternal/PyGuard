{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nagisa' Python package, defining dependencies, extensions, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional logic for reading 'README.md', functions defining extensions and dependencies, setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data directly influences system behavior or causes data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into 'long_description'. No user input flows into critical parts such as execution or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code performs standard setup tasks, with conditional dependency management based on environment.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and third-party tools like setuptools, Cython, and numpy. It conditionally converts a markdown file to reStructuredText for long description, which is typical. The 'extensions' function sets up Cython extensions with numpy include directories. The 'switch_install_requires' function conditionally adjusts dependencies based on Python version and OS. The 'setup()' call configures the package with metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and extension modules. All code appears to serve legitimate setup and build purposes without suspicious logic or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It manages dependencies and extensions securely and transparently. No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code is found.",
