  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup.py for a Python package, with no suspicious activity. It reads the README, manages dependencies, configures Cython extensions, and sets metadata. No network, data leaks, or code injections are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward and typical for package setup. No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior. It emphasizes that no untrusted data handling or external communications are involved.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code performs standard package configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. It highlights the lack of external network activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, confirming the code is typical for package setup, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — fitting.\n\n- **Assessment:** Valid; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a normal setup script, with a note that the security risk score is 0.2, possibly due to the conditional dependency management based on environment.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — somewhat cautious but still reasonable.\n\n- **Assessment:** While the code itself is benign, the slight security risk score reflects awareness that conditional dependency logic could, in some contexts, be exploited if dependencies are malicious. However, in this case, the logic is straightforward and typical.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report. The code performs standard package setup tasks.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed. The code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, as no malicious behaviors are present.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** All are appropriate; the minor security risk in report 5 is justifiable given the dependency management, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks evident)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The slight security risk score in report 5 is reasonable but does not indicate actual malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malware or obfuscation. The dependency management logic is typical and does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a zero or near-zero security risk score.",
