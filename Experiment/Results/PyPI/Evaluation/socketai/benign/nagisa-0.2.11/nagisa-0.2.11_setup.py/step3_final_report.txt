  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python module with Cython extensions and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, imports modules, defines dependencies, and configures extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network communication, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads files, sets dependencies, and initializes setup; no external data flow or user input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package, including conditional dependencies and Cython extension configuration. It performs standard package setup tasks without any network activity, data leaks, or malicious code. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The dependency logic is conventional and does not pose security risks. Overall, the script is safe and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports appears conservative and unwarranted given the code's straightforward nature.",
