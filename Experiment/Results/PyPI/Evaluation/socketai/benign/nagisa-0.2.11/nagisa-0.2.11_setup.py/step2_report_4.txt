  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup.py script with no suspicious activity, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirming the script's standard nature, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, the script performs typical setup tasks, no suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion: standard setup script, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Also describes a typical setup script, with a note on conditional dependencies and no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Additional note:** The report assigns a small security risk (0.2) possibly due to the conditional dependency logic, but this is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for package setup.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. The small 0.2 risk assigned in Report 5 seems to be an overestimate; conditional dependency logic is common and not risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all assessments.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all assessments.\n- **Risk:** 0, as no security threats are present.\n\n**Overall, the code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no security concerns.**",
