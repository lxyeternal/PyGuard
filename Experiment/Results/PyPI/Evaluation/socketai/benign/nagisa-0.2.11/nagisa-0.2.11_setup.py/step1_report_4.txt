  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nagisa' Python package, configuring dependencies, extensions, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing modules, defining functions, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified that handle untrusted data directly; no network, file, or environment variable leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading files to set long description, defining package dependencies, and configuring extensions and setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The code primarily handles package setup and configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including conditional dependency management based on Python version and OS. It imports modules securely, reads documentation files, and configures Cython extensions with numpy include directories. No suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor code are present. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use.",
