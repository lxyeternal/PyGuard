  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nagisa' Python package, configuring build, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long description, importing setuptools, sys, os, and optional modules for setup.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No untrusted data handling, no external data inputs processed dynamically.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. Use of standard setup and build patterns. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading README for description, configuring extension modules with Cython and numpy, setting dependencies based on Python version, and defining package metadata. It includes conditional importing and fallback mechanisms for reading files. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed. The code appears standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages dependencies, extensions, and metadata securely. No malware or malicious anomalies are detected.",
