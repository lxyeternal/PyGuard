  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'nagisa', including optional Cython extensions, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional logic for reading 'README.md', and functions defining extensions and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified that involve untrusted data processing or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content and constructing the setup configuration; no untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The script primarily configures package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading a README file, defining package classifiers, configuring Cython extensions, and setting dependencies based on environment. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity is evident. The only dynamic behavior involves reading files and setting dependencies conditionally, which are common in setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. All functions and conditional logic serve typical package configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or data leaks. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
