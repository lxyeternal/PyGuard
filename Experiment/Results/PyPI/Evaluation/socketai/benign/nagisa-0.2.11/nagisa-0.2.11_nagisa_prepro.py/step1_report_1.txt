{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load, process, and generate vocabulary dictionaries from text datasets for NLP tasks, particularly involving token embeddings, word, POS tags, and n-grams, and to prepare data for model training.",
  "sources": "File reading operations in 'embedding_loader', 'create_vocabs_from_trainset', and 'from_file' class constructor; data normalization and tokenization functions; reading pre-trained embeddings; reading training and dataset files.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects; no code injections or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data read from files (sources) flows into vocabulary creation, token processing, and feature extraction functions, ultimately used to generate embedding matrices and structured datasets; no untrusted data flows into sensitive system calls or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code uses standard data processing and vocabulary creation techniques. No obfuscated or suspicious dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data loading, normalization, and vocabulary creation for NLP tasks. It reads from files containing text data and pre-trained embeddings, processes text into tokens, and builds dictionaries with frequency thresholds. No network communication, system command execution, or hidden behaviors are present. All data handling appears to be straightforward and consistent with typical NLP preprocessing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard NLP data preprocessing module with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It effectively loads and processes data for training NLP models. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
