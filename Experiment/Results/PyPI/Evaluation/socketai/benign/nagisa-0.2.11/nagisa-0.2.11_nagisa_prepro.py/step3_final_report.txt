{
  "purpose": "The code loads pre-trained embeddings, creates vocabularies from training data, and processes text data for NLP tasks, including normalization and feature extraction.",
  "sources": "File input for embeddings, training set, and dictionary files; data reading for vocabulary creation and text processing.",
  "sinks": "Local data structures; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Reads embedding and training data files (sources) -> processes and constructs vocabularies and features -> outputs data structures for NLP models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of random.uniform for unknown embeddings is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP preprocessing: loading embeddings, creating vocabularies with frequency thresholds, normalizing text, and preparing data for models. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. External utility functions are assumed safe. Random initialization of unknown embeddings is common. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard NLP preprocessing module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
