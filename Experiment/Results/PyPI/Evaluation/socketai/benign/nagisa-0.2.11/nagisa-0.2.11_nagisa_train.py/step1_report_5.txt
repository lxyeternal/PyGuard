{
  "purpose": "This code implements a training pipeline for a joint word segmentation and sequence labeling model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation functions.",
  "sources": "Data files for training, validation, and testing; environment variables for seed; embedding files if provided.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that perform unsafe operations; no network or system commands executed from untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data (files) -> data preprocessing functions -> model training and evaluation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No use of insecure environment variables, unsafe SQL, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a fixed random seed, loads datasets, constructs models, and performs training with evaluation checkpoints. No network operations, system commands, or suspicious data handling are present. The only external inputs are data files and optional embedding files, which are used in a standard manner. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are detected. The overall structure appears typical for a machine learning training pipeline. No indicators of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or sabotage are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate training script for a NLP model with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It uses standard libraries and practices, and no suspicious activities are evident.",
