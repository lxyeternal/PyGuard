{
  "purpose": "A standard NLP training pipeline for joint word segmentation and sequence labeling, involving data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving models.",
  "sources": "File inputs for training, development, and test datasets; optional embedding and dictionary files; data read during preprocessing.",
  "sinks": "Model files saved to disk; data processed in memory; no network or external system calls observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files through preprocessing functions to training routines; models are periodically saved; evaluation functions process data and generate metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code structure is straightforward and typical for ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps for NLP tasks. It uses common libraries and practices, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's structure. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), justified by potential file access or data sensitivity, but no active threats are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured NLP training script with no signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the context. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
