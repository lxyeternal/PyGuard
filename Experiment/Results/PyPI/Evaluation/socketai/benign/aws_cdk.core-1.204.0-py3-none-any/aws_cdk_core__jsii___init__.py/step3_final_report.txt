  "purpose": "Setup and load a JSII assembly for AWS CDK core module, then publish module info.",
  "sources": "Import statements, jsii.JSIIAssembly.load(), publication.publish()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; assembly load and publish are standard operations",
  "flows": "Imports and assembly load lead to publication; no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for AWS CDK module setup",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports, loads a specific versioned JSII assembly, and publishes module info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The assembly load and publish are typical in CDK modules. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected. The code is static, readable, and aligns with typical setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign AWS CDK module setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code's nature. Overall, it poses no security risks.",
