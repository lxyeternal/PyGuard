{
  "purpose": "Provides tile access to Girder items with tifffile-readable files by extending existing classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from girder_large_image.girder_tilesource and local module . (TifffileFileTileSource)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no network, file, or environment variable usage observed",
  "flows": "The class defines attributes and inherits methods, with no direct data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; straightforward class inheritance with documentation",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a subclass that combines functionality from two parent classes. It sets class attributes for caching and naming. No data input handling, environment interaction, or external communication observed. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, harmless class definition extending existing image tile source classes. No malicious activity, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
