{
  "purpose": "Provides tile access to TIFF images within a Girder environment by extending existing classes.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance from TifffileFileTileSource and GirderTileSource, static attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, output, or network communication; static code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely class attribute setup.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscation; straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class inheriting from two base classes, setting static attributes. No input handling, external communication, or dynamic execution is present. The code is standard for extending image tiling functionality, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. The security assessments across reports agree that the code is benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight variation in security risk scores (0 or 0.1) is negligible; given the static nature, 0 is more appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard class extension with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
