  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard plugin registry system with no malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins loaded via entry points. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3), consistent with the potential risks of plugin architectures."
