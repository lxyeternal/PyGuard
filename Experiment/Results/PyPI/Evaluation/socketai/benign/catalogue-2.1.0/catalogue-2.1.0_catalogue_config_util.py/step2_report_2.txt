  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code consists of utility functions and classes: a Protocol for decorators, a custom partial function that preserves docstrings, and a generator validator class.\n- All components use standard Python libraries.\n- No external or untrusted input sources, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No network, filesystem, or system modification.\n- No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and serve typical utility purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign utility module, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1).\n- **Reasoning:** Since the code is purely utility with no external interactions, a securityRisk of 0.1 seems slightly overestimated. It might be a default conservative score.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Given the code's nature, a securityRisk of 0.1 is still very low but acceptable as a minimal residual risk.  \n**Verdict:** Slightly reduce securityRisk to 0, as no actual risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility module, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The only point of contention is the securityRisk score in Report 2, which is slightly elevated at 0.1 despite no real security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** For reports 1, 3, 4, 5, keep at 0.\n  - For report 2, reduce from 0.1 to 0, as no actual security risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is straightforward utility code with no malicious or obfuscated components, and the scores should reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, and the reports are mostly accurate. The slight overestimation of security risk in one report should be corrected for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n**This aligns with the code's benign nature.**",
