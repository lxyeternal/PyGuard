{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility classes and functions for function decoration, partial application, and generator validation, primarily for use in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Code reads module imports, sys.version_info, and class/method definitions. No external input or data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform critical operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; functions and classes are used internally for code organization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code appears straightforward, focusing on utility functions and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, implements a Protocol for type safety, defines a custom partial function that preserves docstrings, and a generator class with validation methods. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The use of type hints and protocols indicates attention to type safety, not obfuscation or malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for internal use, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides helpful abstractions for function decoration and generator validation.",
