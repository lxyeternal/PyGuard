{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes and functions for Python programming, including decorators, partial function wrappers, and custom generator validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (contextlib, functools, shutil, sys, tempfile, pathlib, typing), and class/function definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code mainly defines utility constructs without data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of Protocol for type hinting, standard function wrappers, and generator validation appear legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Protocol-based Decorator class for type hinting, a custom partial function to preserve metadata, and a Generator class for validating iterators. All components rely solely on standard library imports and straightforward logic. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The functions and classes serve as utility components without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for Python programming, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
