  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility classes and functions using standard Python libraries. It does not perform any network, filesystem, or system modifications. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is static, well-structured, and typical for utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report can be adjusted to 0 for consistency, as no actual risk exists.",
