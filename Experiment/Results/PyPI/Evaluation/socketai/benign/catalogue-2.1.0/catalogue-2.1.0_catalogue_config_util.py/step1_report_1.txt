{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes and functions for decorators, partial function creation, and custom generator validation.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input sources; the code imports standard libraries and defines functions/classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions are purely utility wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Protocol for decorators, a custom partial function that retains docstrings, and a generator validator class with standard methods. All parts are typical utility functions/classes with no data processing, network activity, or system modification. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The imports and functions are standard and do not interact with external or sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides well-defined, standard utility functions and classes without any suspicious behavior.",
