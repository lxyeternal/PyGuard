  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions/classes with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no data flows from untrusted sources, no external interactions, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Fully benign, consistent with the report. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard library imports, no external data handling, and no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is slightly above zero, possibly reflecting minimal inherent risk due to code utility nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n**Verdict:** The low securityRisk score is reasonable, given the utility nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing benign utility functions.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns or suspicious behavior. The code is purely utility with standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility code with no external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. Given the code's utility nature and lack of external interactions, a small non-zero score (like 0.1) for minimal inherent risk is reasonable, but even 0.1 might be slightly high.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** Confirmed to be 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, I would suggest **0** for all reports, as the code does not pose any security threat or risk.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The code is standard utility code, safe for supply chain inclusion.\n- The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report could be adjusted down to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis, confirming the code's benign nature and absence of security issues.",
