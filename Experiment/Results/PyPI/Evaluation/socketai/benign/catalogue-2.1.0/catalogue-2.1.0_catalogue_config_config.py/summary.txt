  "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but presents a supply chain risk if registry functions are untrusted. It is secure when used with trusted registry entries. The main security concern is the dynamic execution of external functions, which could be exploited if malicious code is registered. No signs of embedded malware or obfuscation are detected."
