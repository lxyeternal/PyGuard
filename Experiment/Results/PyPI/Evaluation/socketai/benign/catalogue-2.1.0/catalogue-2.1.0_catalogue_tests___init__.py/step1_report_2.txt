  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script designed for data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose or high-level description is evident from the code snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, local variables, and possibly environment variables via os.environ. No external data sources or network inputs are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to standard output and performs file operations (if any). No dangerous sinks such as network connections, eval, exec, or database queries are detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (from parameters or environment) is processed locally. There are no evident flows leading to potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code structure appears straightforward. No suspicious dynamic execution or obscure language features detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows the code uses standard Python constructs, with no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. No external network calls, no untrusted input handling leading to unsafe operations, and no hidden behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign and suitable for use.",
