  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with no malicious intent. The presence of eval/exec warrants a moderate increase in malware and security risk scores, as these features can be exploited maliciously despite current benign assessment. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed carefully if dynamic execution is involved."
