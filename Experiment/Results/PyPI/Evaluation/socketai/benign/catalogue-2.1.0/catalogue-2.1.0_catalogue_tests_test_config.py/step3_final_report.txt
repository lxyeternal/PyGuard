{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for a configuration management system, validating parsing, interpolation, schema validation, and registry functions within a controlled environment. It does not involve external untrusted sources or system calls.",
  "sources": "Static test inputs, function decorators, and internal data structures; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or system commands; data flows within internal validation, registry, and interpolation functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static test data into validation, registration, and interpolation processes within the test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code. Use of 'pickle' is limited to controlled test serialization, which is safe here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured test suite for configuration validation, interpolation, and registry management. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'pickle' and string interpolation could pose risks if used with untrusted input outside this controlled context, but within tests, this is safe. No external system calls or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the controlled environment and the limited scope of potentially risky features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, controlled test environment with no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The low risk score is appropriate, and the absence of malware or obfuscation is confirmed. The interpolation and 'pickle' usage are acceptable within this context.",
