  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package metadata handler with a known potential vector in dynamic module loading. No active malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary risk stems from the dynamic import, which could be exploited if untrusted entry points are installed. Therefore, the malware score should be low but acknowledge this vector, and the overall security risk remains moderate due to this potential."
