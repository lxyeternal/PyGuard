The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security risk remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package metadata handler with a known potential vector in dynamic module loading. No active malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary risk stems from the dynamic import, which could be exploited if untrusted entry points are installed. Therefore, the malware score should be low but acknowledge this vector, and the overall security risk remains moderate due to this potential."

The main security concern is the dynamic execution of external functions, which could be exploited if malicious code is registered. No signs of embedded malware or obfuscation are detected."

The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report can be adjusted to 0 for consistency, as no actual risk exists."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with no malicious intent. The presence of eval/exec warrants a moderate increase in malware and security risk scores, as these features can be exploited maliciously despite current benign assessment. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed carefully if dynamic execution is involved."
