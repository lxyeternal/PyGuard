  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'catalogue' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "No untrusted data sources; static import of setuptools modules and fixed package name.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static code with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with a fixed package name. It executes only if run as main, with no input handling, no secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscation. All indicators point to a benign, standard packaging utility. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common practices confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python setup utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
