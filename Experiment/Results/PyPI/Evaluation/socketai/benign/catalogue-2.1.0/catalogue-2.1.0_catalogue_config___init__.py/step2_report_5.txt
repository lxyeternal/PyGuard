  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .config import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code performs a relative import of all symbols from a local module named `config`.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`*`), which is generally discouraged because it pollutes the namespace and can hide malicious code or sensitive data.\n- The actual content of `config` is unknown; thus, any security assessment depends on its contents.\n- No other code or data flows are present in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all symbols from 'config'.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states this is a standard import, with no malicious activity evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'config'.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes dependence on 'config' contents.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.5\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. Slightly higher securityRisk due to reliance on external module, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'config'.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes that wildcard import is discouraged and can conceal malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly flags wildcard import as suspicious due to namespace pollution and potential concealment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.6\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The concern about obscured malicious code is valid, but without evidence, malware score remains zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'config'.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Similar to previous, flags the wildcard import as a potential security concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.3, confidence=0.6\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reasoning. No direct malicious activity, but the risk due to obscurity is acknowledged.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'config'.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; emphasizes that the import alone isn't malicious but depends on 'config'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Low risk, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign zero, as the import statement itself isn't malicious.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign zero, but given the use of `from .config import *`, which is discouraged and can hide malicious code, a small obfuscation concern could be justified if the 'config' module's contents are unknown. However, since the content isn't provided, it's acceptable to keep obfuscated=0.\n- **Security risk:** The scores vary from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the concern that wildcard imports can hide malicious code or cause namespace pollution. This is reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The reasoning is sound; the main concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a known bad practice and can be exploited if 'config' is malicious.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate unless evidence of malicious code within 'config' is provided.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation techniques visible; the wildcard import is a concern but not necessarily obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate concern due to use of wildcard import and potential for hidden malicious code if 'config' is compromised)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The main security concern is the use of `from .config import *`, which can obscure malicious code if 'config' is malicious or compromised. However, without evidence, there's no reason to assign a higher malware score.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3.",
