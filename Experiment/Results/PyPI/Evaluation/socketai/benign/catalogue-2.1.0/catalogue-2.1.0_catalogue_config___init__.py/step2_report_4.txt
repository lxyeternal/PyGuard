  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Standard import, no malicious activity or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Fully reasonable. The code is a straightforward import with no signs of malicious intent. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Same as Report 1, but with a lower confidence (0.5) and a slight security risk score (0.2).  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.5, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, which is appropriate given the dependence on the 'config' module's content. The malware score remains 0, which is correct because the line itself isn't malicious. The security risk score is modest, reflecting the potential concern if 'config' is malicious. This seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Uses a wildcard import (`from .config import *`), which is generally discouraged.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.6, malware=0, securityRisk=0.4  \n- **Assessment:** The higher security risk score (0.4) is justified due to the use of wildcard import, which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious code. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate because the import statement alone isn't malicious. The confidence level is slightly higher, reflecting the concern about obscurity. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 3, with emphasis on obscurity and potential concealment of malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.6, malware=0, securityRisk=0.3  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk score (0.3) than Report 3, which is acceptable. The reasoning aligns with best practices; wildcard imports can hide malicious code if the 'config' module is compromised. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Same as previous, minimal import statement with no further context.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.2, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** The low confidence (0.2) is justified due to lack of context. The security risk is also low, as the import alone isn't suspicious. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the import statement itself isn't malicious.\n- The main concern revolves around the use of wildcard imports (`from .config import *`), which can hide malicious code if the 'config' module is compromised.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the information.\n- The security risk scores are higher where wildcard imports are used, reflecting valid concern about obscurity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are generally consistent and reasonable.\n- No report overestimates the malicious potential; all maintain a malware score of 0.\n- The security risk scores appropriately reflect the risk introduced by wildcard imports.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code snippet itself is benign; all concerns are about the potential risk depending on the 'config' module's contents.\n- The scores align well with the analysis.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard import statement with no inherent malicious behavior.  \n- The use of wildcard import introduces a potential security concern due to obscurity, but not malicious activity.  \n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation beyond standard wildcard import, which is discouraged but not malicious)  \n- **Risk:** 0.3 (due to wildcard import, potential for hidden malicious code if 'config' is compromised)\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
