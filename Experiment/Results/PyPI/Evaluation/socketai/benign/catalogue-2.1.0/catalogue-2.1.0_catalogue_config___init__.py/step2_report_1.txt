  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .config import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Standard import of all symbols from a local module `config`.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity or malicious behavior detected. The confidence is high (1), and all scores are zero.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and no issues are present.\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Import all contents from `config`; potential concern depends on `config` content.\n- **Findings:** The reasoning is sound; the import is straightforward, but the security risk depends on the content of `config`.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.5, securityRisk 0.2, malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The risk is low but not negligible if `config` is compromised.\n- **Score adjustments:** No significant change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Use of wildcard import (`from .config import *`), which is discouraged.\n- **Findings:** Wildcard imports can obscure dependencies and potentially hide malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, securityRisk 0.4, malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly highlights the risk associated with wildcard imports. The concern about concealment is valid.\n- **Score adjustments:** Slightly higher malware score could be justified if the `config` module is malicious, but since content is unknown, keeping malware at 0 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; wildcard import, potential obscurity.\n- **Findings:** Same reasoning; no direct malicious activity, but the use of wildcard import raises concerns.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, securityRisk 0.3, malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Import from `config`, no apparent malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Same as previous; import is standard but depends on `config` content.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.2, securityRisk 0.2, malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign malware as 0 because the import statement alone does not indicate malicious behavior. However, the use of wildcard imports (`from .config import *`) can be a vector for malicious code if the `config` module is compromised or malicious. Since the actual content of `config` is unknown, the malware score could be marginally increased in reports emphasizing the risks of wildcard imports, but given the information, keeping it at 0 is reasonable.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variations exist, but they are all within reasonable bounds considering the potential for hidden malicious code in `config`. The highest risk is associated with wildcard import, which is correctly reflected.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The use of wildcard import (`from .config import *`) is a concern but not inherently malicious. It warrants caution and further review of the `config` module itself.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (since no malicious activity can be inferred solely from the import statement).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (the code is clear and straightforward).\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 to 0.3 (due to the wildcard import's potential to hide malicious code, but without evidence, it remains low).\n\n**In conclusion**, the import statement itself is benign, but the use of wildcard import warrants caution. Further inspection of the `config` module is recommended to rule out malicious payloads.",
