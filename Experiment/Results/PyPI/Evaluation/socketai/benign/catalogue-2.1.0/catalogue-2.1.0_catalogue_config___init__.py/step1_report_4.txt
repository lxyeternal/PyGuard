  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local 'config' module.",

  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Importing 'config' may influence subsequent code execution by providing configurations, but no direct data flow is observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a relative import with a wildcard '*', which can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious code or sensitive information. No explicit code or data manipulation is visible here.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import from the 'config' module. The use of 'from .config import *' can be risky because it imports all definitions into the current namespace, potentially overwriting existing variables or hiding malicious code within 'config'. Since the content of 'config' is not shown, it is impossible to determine if it contains malicious code or sensitive data. The import alone is not malicious, but it raises concerns about obscured code or potential misuse if 'config' is malicious or poorly secured.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple relative import which, in isolation, is not inherently malicious. However, the use of wildcard import can hide malicious behavior or sensitive information, especially if the 'config' module is compromised. Without further context, this presents a potential security concern due to obscurity rather than explicit malicious activity.",
