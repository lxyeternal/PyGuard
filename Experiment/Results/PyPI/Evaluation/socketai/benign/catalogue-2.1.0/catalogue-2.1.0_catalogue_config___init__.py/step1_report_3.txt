  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local config module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from a local module named config",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential use of imported variables or functions could lead to data flow issues",
  "flows": "Not explicitly defined in this line; depends on how imported items are used elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import (from .config import *) is generally discouraged as it can obscure dependencies and introduce hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of all symbols from a module named 'config'. Such wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution and make static analysis difficult. Without seeing the contents of 'config', it's impossible to determine if malicious code or backdoors are present. However, the use of a wildcard import itself is suspicious as it can be used to hide malicious code, especially if the config module contains malicious payloads. No other code or logic is present in this snippet to analyze further.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal but raises some concerns due to the use of wildcard import, which could conceal malicious code or backdoors if the 'config' module is compromised. Additional review of the 'config' module is necessary to ensure safety.",
