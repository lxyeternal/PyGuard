  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from a local module named 'config'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .config module.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data output or external communication shown.",
  "flows": "Imported symbols from config are available for use, but no execution flow is provided.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a single import statement with a relative import, which is minimal but does not indicate malicious behavior by itself. However, import statements can be used to execute malicious code if the module imported is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing everything from the 'config' module. This is common in Python projects to include configuration variables or settings. Since no further code or context is provided, it is impossible to determine if the 'config' module contains malicious code. The import itself is not inherently suspicious but relies on the trustworthiness of the 'config' module. Without additional context or content of 'config', no malicious behavior can be confirmed or denied.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement that, in isolation, shows no evidence of malicious behavior. Its security implications depend entirely on the contents of the 'config' module, which are not provided. Therefore, based solely on this line, no malicious intent or security risks can be determined.",
