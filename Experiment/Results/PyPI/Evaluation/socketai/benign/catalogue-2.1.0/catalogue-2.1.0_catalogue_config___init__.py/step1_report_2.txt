  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local 'config' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'config' module in the current package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leak points; import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths are present in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; potential concern if 'config' contains malicious code or backdoors, but this cannot be determined from this single line.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement, importing all definitions from a local module named 'config'. The actual content and behavior depend entirely on the contents of 'config'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this line alone. No unusual language features or obfuscation are present. The code's security implications depend on the 'config' module's contents, which are not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. Security risks depend on the contents of 'config'. No malicious activity is evident from this line alone.",
