{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from a local module named 'config'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; potential issues depend on the content of 'config'.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet; reliance on external 'config' module content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('from .config import *'), which can obscure dependencies and hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious activity. Wildcard imports are discouraged as they can conceal malicious payloads or sensitive data, especially if the 'config' module is compromised. The scores reflect that the import itself is benign (malware=0), not obfuscated (obfuscated=0), but the use of wildcard import introduces a security concern (risk=0.3). The confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9), but the potential for hidden malicious code warrants caution. Overall, the code is simple and safe in isolation, but the import method warrants further review of the 'config' module.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign; no malicious activity is evident. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if 'config' is compromised. Scores are appropriate, with low malware risk but moderate security concern due to import style.",
