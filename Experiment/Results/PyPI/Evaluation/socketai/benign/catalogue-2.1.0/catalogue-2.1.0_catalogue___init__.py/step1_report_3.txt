{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config', likely to set up or configure an application or system based on external modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this snippet only contains import statements without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from external modules. The use of wildcard imports is discouraged as it reduces code clarity and can hide malicious imports if present. No other suspicious or malicious activity is evident from this fragment. Without access to the imported modules, it is impossible to determine if they contain malicious code. The snippet itself does not perform any operations or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to import statements with no direct malicious behavior. The use of wildcard imports is a concern for code clarity but not necessarily malicious. No malware or security risks are evident from this fragment alone.",
