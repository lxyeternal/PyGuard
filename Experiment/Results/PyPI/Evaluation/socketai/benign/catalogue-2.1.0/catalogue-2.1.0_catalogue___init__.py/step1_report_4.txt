{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config', likely for configuration and registry access within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in these lines.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements present, no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure actual imported components, potentially hiding malicious or unnecessary code. No evidence of malicious code in these statements alone.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple import statements, which do not execute any code or handle data directly. The use of wildcard imports can be suspicious if the modules contain malicious or unnecessary code, but without inspecting the modules themselves, this cannot be confirmed. No signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident from these lines alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements with no apparent malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged but does not inherently indicate malicious activity. No malware or security risks are detectable from these lines alone.",
