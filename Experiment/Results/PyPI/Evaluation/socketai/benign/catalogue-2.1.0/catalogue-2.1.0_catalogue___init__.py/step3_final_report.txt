  "sources": "Places where code reads input or data: Import statements from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config'.",
  "sinks": "Places where untrusted data can lead to potential data leak or effect: Import statements themselves do not act as sinks; reliance on external modules could be a concern if modules are malicious.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths: The import statements load external modules into the namespace; no data flow or execution beyond import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols and hinder static analysis; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements using wildcard imports from external modules. No runtime behavior, data flow, or malicious activity is evident. The wildcard imports are a coding best practice concern but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the minimal code and potential for external module compromise. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign import statements with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure imported symbols and complicate security auditing. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security risk remains low.",
