  "purpose": "The code imports modules or symbols from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config', likely for configuration and registry management within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing modules or symbols from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in these import statements alone.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are observable from these imports alone.",
  "anomalies": "Import statements are standard; however, the absence of further code prevents detection of any malicious behavior or obfuscation. Potential concern if imported modules contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from the import statements alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config'. These are standard Python import statements used to include modules or symbols. Without additional code, it's impossible to determine if the imported modules contain malicious behavior. The import pattern itself does not indicate malicious activity, but reliance on external modules always warrants caution if those modules are compromised or malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident in these lines. Given only these lines, there's insufficient evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code only contains import statements, which are typical in Python programs. There is no direct malicious behavior or obfuscation evident. However, because the code relies on external modules, their integrity should be verified in the broader context. Overall, the code itself appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
