  "purpose": "Import all contents from catalogue.registry and catalogue.config modules, likely to use their functionalities or data in the larger program.",
  "sources": "Imports entire modules catalogue.registry and catalogue.config",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks observed; however, imported modules may contain functions or data that could be used downstream for sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown in this snippet; potential flows depend on how imported functions or variables are used later.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can obscure which specific variables or functions are imported, potentially hiding malicious or sensitive data. No malicious code is evident in these import statements alone.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet imports all contents from two modules without explicit selection. While this pattern can lead to namespace pollution, it does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Without additional context or usage, it is not possible to identify malicious intent. The import pattern alone is common in Python but can be exploited to hide malicious code if combined with malicious modules, which cannot be determined here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard imports is a best practice concern but not malicious in itself. Further analysis would require examining the contents of 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config'.",
