{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and variables from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config' modules, likely to configure or initialize certain components of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'catalogue.registry' and 'catalogue.config' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The imported modules may define data flows internally, but there are no explicit source-to-sink flows visible in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure what functions or variables are being imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. No explicit malicious code or suspicious behavior detected in this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code performs imports from two modules using wildcard syntax, which can hide imported items and make static analysis more difficult. No other logic, data handling, or dynamic behavior is present. Since the code only involves imports, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this fragment. However, the use of wildcard imports can be considered a practice that hampers clarity and security auditing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is limited to import statements and does not contain any overt malicious behavior or security issues on its own. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can conceal malicious or unintended code in the imported modules. Further review of the imported modules would be necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
