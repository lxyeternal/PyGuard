{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an API for color operations, importing functions from local modules and defining module metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from .operations and .utils modules, likely local code files",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or other data leaks are evident",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; module simply re-exports imported functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected; code structure is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py file",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from local modules, sets version info, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no user input handling, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. All elements are consistent with a standard package initializer. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation. The code functions solely to organize and expose module components.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an interface for other modules without performing any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
