{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export color operation functions and utilities related to image processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from .operations and .utils modules; no external data inputs observed.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; only imports and exports are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports functions and variables from internal submodules and defines an export list. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious operations. The module appears to serve as an interface or API for image processing functions. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are evident based on this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup with imports and exports, showing no malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign part of a larger package, likely used for image color operations.",
