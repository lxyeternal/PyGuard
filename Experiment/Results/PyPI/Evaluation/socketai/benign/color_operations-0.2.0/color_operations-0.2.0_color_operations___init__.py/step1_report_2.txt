{
  "purpose": "This module appears to provide color operation functions and utilities for image processing, exporting certain functions and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules '.operations' and '.utils'. No external input sources or data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only imports and exports functions, with no data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is solely defining and exporting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions related to image processing from local modules and defines the package version and exported symbols. It is purely declarative with no data processing, user input, or external communications. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, intended for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer for a color operations library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only imports and re-exports functions, and there are no suspicious or malicious elements.",
