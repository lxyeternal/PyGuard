  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` for a Python package.\n- It imports functions (`gamma`, `parse_operations`, `saturation`, `sigmoidal`) from `.operations`.\n- It imports utilities (`magick_to_operations`, `scale_dtype`, `to_math_type`) from `.utils`.\n- Sets a version string `__version__ = \"0.2.0\"`.\n- Defines `__all__` to specify public API exports.\n\n**Security and Malware Considerations:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no handling of untrusted input, and no obfuscated code.\n   - All imports are from local modules, and no external data or user input is involved.\n   - The structure and purpose align with a standard package initializer.\n\n2. **Potential Risks or Flaws:**\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation.\n   - No suspicious data flows or external communication.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as an API surface.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks evident; the code is a benign package initializer.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives; the reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with a confidence level of 1.\n- The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Given the code's nature, I would maintain the current scores.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet appears to be a standard, safe package initializer with no security concerns.",
