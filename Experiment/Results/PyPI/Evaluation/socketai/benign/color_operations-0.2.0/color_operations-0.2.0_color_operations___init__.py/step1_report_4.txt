  "purpose": "Module exporting color operation functions and utilities for image processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.operations and .utils). No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks identified; no dynamic execution or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific functions and variables from sibling modules and then exposes them via __all__ for public API. It defines a version string. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an interface to submodules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization file with no suspicious or malicious code present. It solely re-exports functions and variables for external use, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
