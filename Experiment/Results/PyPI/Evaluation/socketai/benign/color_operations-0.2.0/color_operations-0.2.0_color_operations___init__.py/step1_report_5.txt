  "purpose": "Module for color operations including gamma correction, saturation adjustment, and related utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.operations and .utils), no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sensitive sinks; only imports and exports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns; simple import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and module metadata such as version and exported symbols. It does not process any input data, perform computations, or execute any code beyond module setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, no hidden or malicious code, no external data transmission, and no security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward Python package interface definition with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger color processing library.",
