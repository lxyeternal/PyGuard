  "purpose": "Unit tests for color_operations.utils module functions related to image processing.",
  "sources": "np.array inputs, function calls such as to_math_type, scale_dtype, magick_to_rio",
  "sinks": "Assertions on array values and data types; no untrusted data sources or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input arrays processed by utility functions, results checked against expected values; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard test cases.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and pytest for testing. It defines a fixture array and several test functions that validate utility functions in the color_operations.utils module. The tests check conversions between data types, scaling, and color adjustments. All code operates on internally generated data without external input or side effects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden payloads. The code is straightforward and consistent with typical unit testing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of unit tests for image processing utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
