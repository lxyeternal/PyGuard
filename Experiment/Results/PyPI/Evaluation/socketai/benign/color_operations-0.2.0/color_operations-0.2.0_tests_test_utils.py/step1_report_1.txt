  "purpose": "Utility functions for color operations including type conversions, scaling, and command string parsing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from numpy arrays, function parameters, and string inputs in magick_to_rio.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no data leaks or insecure outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Input strings in magick_to_rio flow into parsing functions to produce command sequences; array data flows through conversion functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code, excessive dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains utility functions for data conversion and string parsing. numpy arrays are used for data processing with no external input sources or untrusted data flows. The magick_to_rio function parses a command string into a sequence of commands, which appears to be standard string processing without any evident malicious intent. No suspicious code patterns, secret data, or malicious payloads are present. Overall, this is benign utility code with no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for image/color data manipulation and command parsing. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
