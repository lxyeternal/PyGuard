  "purpose": "Utility functions for color operations and associated test code.",
  "sources": "Static command strings in magick_to_rio and internal numpy array data.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sources; data flows are internal and static.",
  "flows": "Static command string processed by magick_to_rio; numpy arrays converted internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and tests with static data and command strings. No external inputs or untrusted data flows are present. The functions perform data conversions and string parsing typical for image processing tasks. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is evident. The static command strings are used for testing purposes and do not pose security risks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its utility and test nature. The assessments across all reports are consistent and justified.",
