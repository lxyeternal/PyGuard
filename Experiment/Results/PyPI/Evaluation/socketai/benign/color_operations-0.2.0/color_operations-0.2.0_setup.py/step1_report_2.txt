  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package related to color image operations, configuring build and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing modules, accessing numpy for headers, reading setup parameters, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous operations. The script primarily configures package setup.",
  "flows": "N/A — standard setup flow: reading files, importing modules, configuring extensions, and executing setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. Use of import statements and setup configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks for a Python package, including conditional Cython compilation and environment checks. No indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. All operations are related to package configuration and dependency management, with no network or system modifications. The only external interaction is reading a README file and obtaining headers from numpy, both benign. The import of modules and reading of environment variables are standard for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It handles package configuration and dependencies securely without any evident security risks.",
