{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package related to color image processing, handling dependencies and Cython compilation.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file, imports system modules, imports dependencies like numpy and Cython, reads setup arguments, and uses package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Calls setup() function to install or build the package, but does not write to or modify system files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Imports data from files and dependencies, passes package metadata and extension modules to setup(), uses dependency imports to influence build process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with conditional compilation using Cython, standard dependencies, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations for a Python package with optional Cython compilation. It imports 'numpy' and 'Cython', with fallback logic. It reads a README file, configures extensions based on availability, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. No network activity, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package that compiles Cython extensions if available. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs expected setup functions with standard dependencies and metadata.",
