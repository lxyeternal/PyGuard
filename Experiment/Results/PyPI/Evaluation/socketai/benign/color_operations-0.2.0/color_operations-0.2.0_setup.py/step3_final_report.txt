{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package involving optional Cython compilation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file, imports modules (setuptools, numpy), and checks for Cython and numpy availability.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and dependencies, configures extensions, and calls setup() with package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "None; typical setup process with standard error handling and conditional compilation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script for a Python package. It conditionally uses Cython if available, reads the README file, manages dependencies like numpy, and exits if numpy is missing. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The control flow and dependency handling are standard, and there are no external data flows or network operations. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
