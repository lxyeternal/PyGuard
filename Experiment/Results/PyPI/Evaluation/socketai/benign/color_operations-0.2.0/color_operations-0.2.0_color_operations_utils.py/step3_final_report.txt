  "purpose": "Utility functions for color data manipulation and translating ImageMagick command options into internal color operation strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: strings for ImageMagick options, numpy arrays for color data.",
  "sinks": "Generated command strings and scaled numpy arrays; no external data flows or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed within functions; no external data flow beyond function scope.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'global' variable 'bands' is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for color data scaling and ImageMagick command translation. It does not perform network, file, or system operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only concern is the use of 'global' for 'bands', which is poor practice but not a security issue. The functions are well-structured, and no vulnerabilities are evident. Scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for color data processing and command translation. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor concern about 'global' variables does not impact security.",
