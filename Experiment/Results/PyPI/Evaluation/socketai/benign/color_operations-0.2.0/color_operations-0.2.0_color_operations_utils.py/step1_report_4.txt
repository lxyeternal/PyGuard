  "purpose": "Utility functions for color manipulation, conversions, and image processing parameter translation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'convert_opts' in 'magick_to_operations'.",
  "sinks": "String outputs representing color operation commands; no direct sinks for untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "Input string 'convert_opts' -> parsing and splitting -> conditional logic -> string formatting for operations output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'global' variables ('bands') which could lead to unexpected side-effects in larger context; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors found.",
  "analysis": "The code provides color utility functions and a parser for ImageMagick command options, converting them into internal operation strings. No dynamic code execution, eval, or insecure input handling detected. Use of regex and string operations appears standard. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. Global variables usage is notable but not malicious. The functions are straightforward and do not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains standard utility functions for color processing and command translation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily performs data transformation and string formatting with no external side effects or malicious intent.",
