{
  "purpose": "Defines an EasyPost API client class for authenticating and configuring HTTP calls, with various services and hooks.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters (api_key, api_base, timeout), import statements, internal method calls (like urlfetch.get_default_fetch_deadline()), and environment detection logic.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data handling through api_key; use of external libraries (requests, urlfetch) which could be manipulated, but standard in context.",
  "flows": "The api_key is stored but not used directly in this code; hooks are registered via methods. External libraries are imported and used for HTTP requests. Hooks may run custom functions, but no direct code execution or untrusted data flow is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code dynamically chooses request libraries based on environment; this is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a client object for API interaction, configuring service classes and hooks. It conditionally imports libraries based on environment and checks library versions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The hooks allow custom functions to be attached, which could be misused if hooks are misconfigured, but this is standard plugin architecture. Environment detection and exception handling are typical. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client setup with hooks for extensibility. No malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are detected. It relies on standard libraries and environment detection logic. Overall, it is safe based on the provided fragment.",
