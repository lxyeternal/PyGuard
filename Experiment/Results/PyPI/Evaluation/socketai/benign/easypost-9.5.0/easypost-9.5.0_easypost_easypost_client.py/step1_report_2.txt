{
  "purpose": "Defines an EasyPost client class to facilitate authenticated API interactions, service initializations, and request/response hooks.",
  "sources": "Imports constants, hooks, services, and external libraries (requests or google.appengine.api.urlfetch).",
  "sinks": "Assignment of API key, dynamic service instantiation, and hook subscriptions could potentially handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "API key input flows into the class constructor; hook functions can be added or removed; request library selection depends on environment; hooks execute during requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the dynamic import of request libraries based on environment is standard; no obfuscated or suspicious code detected; exception handling for library import/version check is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an API client with configurable parameters, imports necessary modules, and manages request/response hooks. It carefully selects request libraries based on environment, handling potential import errors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. Hook management allows extensibility but does not introduce malicious behavior. The use of external libraries (requests, urlfetch) is standard for such clients and does not indicate malicious intent. Exception handling ensures robustness against environment issues but does not suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client setup with proper handling of dependencies, hooks, and environment-specific configurations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected; the structure and logic are consistent with intended functionality. The overall security risk is minimal, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
