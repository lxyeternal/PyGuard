{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a client class for interacting with the EasyPost API, configuring services, hooks, and request library setup.",
  "sources": "API key input (constructor parameter), module imports, environment-dependent request library (google.appengine.api.urlfetch or requests).",
  "sinks": "Potential sink if the api_key is mishandled or exposed; request hooks could potentially process untrusted data if misused.",
  "flows": "API key input -> stored in self.api_key; hooks (request and response) -> user-defined functions; request library choice -> environment-based.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors. The request hooks and flexible request library setup are standard and not malicious. Exception handling around import and version checks is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages the API key as an instance variable. It conditionally uses urlfetch on Google App Engine or requests elsewhere, with appropriate error handling. Hook subscription methods are standard. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network activity directly but prepares for it via configured services. The environment-dependent logic appears standard for supporting multiple deployment platforms. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client setup with environment-aware request library configuration, hook management, and service initialization. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
