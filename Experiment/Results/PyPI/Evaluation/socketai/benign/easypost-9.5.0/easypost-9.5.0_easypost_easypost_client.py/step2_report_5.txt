  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: an API client class for EasyPost, with service initialization, hook management, environment-aware request library selection, and standard import practices.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The dynamic import of 'requests' or 'urlfetch' is typical for cross-platform compatibility.\n- Hook mechanisms are standard extension points, allowing user-defined functions during request/response cycles.\n- Exception handling and version checks are appropriate and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious data handling.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The API key is stored securely as an instance variable; no direct misuse or exposure is evident.\n- The request library selection is environment-specific and standard.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis: malware scores at 0, obfuscated at 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2).\n\n**Potential Concerns (though none are present here):**\n- The hook system allows user-defined functions, which could be misused if hooks are misconfigured, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- The dynamic import and version checks are standard practices.\n\n**Summary & Justification:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured API client setup.\n- No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the content.\n- Given the thorough review, I agree with the provided scores.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to hooks and environment-dependent code, but nothing malicious)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and standard for an API client setup.",
