{
  "purpose": "Defines the EasyPostClient class for interacting with the EasyPost API, including configuration, service initialization, and hooks.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, import statements, and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "API key usage, dynamic import of request libraries, and hook functions.",
  "flows": "API key and configuration data flow into service objects; hooks are registered and invoked during requests/responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded import paths, dynamic request library selection based on environment, and no evident code injection points.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a client for the EasyPost API with flexible request library selection. It imports constants and services, manages hooks, and handles API configuration parameters. The dynamic import of 'requests' or 'urlfetch' is standard for cross-platform compatibility. The API key is stored in an instance variable but not used insecurely within this snippet. Hook subscription methods are standard event patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The only notable aspect is the dynamic library selection and version checks, which are benign and necessary for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard client setup for API interaction with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It manages hooks and services securely, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows.",
