  "purpose": "A client object used to authenticate and configure all HTTP calls to the EasyPost API.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, class initialization parameters, and internal service constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code primarily initializes services and manages hooks.",
  "flows": "Initialization of API key and base URL -> environment detection for request library -> service instantiation -> hook subscription methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard environment detection and service setup; hooks are typical extension points.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client class that manages configuration, environment-specific request library selection, and service initialization. It includes hook management for request and response processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The dynamic import pattern for 'requests' and 'urlfetch' is standard. Exception handling and version checks are appropriate. The overall structure is clear, and no obfuscation or malicious activity is detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, secure API client setup with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The low security risk and malware scores are justified, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
