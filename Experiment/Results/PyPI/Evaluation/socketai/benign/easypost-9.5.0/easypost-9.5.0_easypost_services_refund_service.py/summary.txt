  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The security risk score could be marginally lowered to 0.0 if input validation is enforced, but given the context, the minimal risk score of around 0.1-0.2 is acceptable."
