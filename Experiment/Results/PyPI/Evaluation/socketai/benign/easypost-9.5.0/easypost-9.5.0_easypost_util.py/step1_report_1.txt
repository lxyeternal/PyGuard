  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing shipping rates, handling webhooks, and selecting the lowest rate options in an EasyPost integration.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as 'easypost_object', 'smart_rates', 'stateless_rates', and 'event_body'; reads HTTP headers in 'validate_webhook'; reads JSON payload from 'raw_input'.",
  "sinks": "JSON parsing in 'receive_event', HMAC signature verification in 'validate_webhook'.",
  "flows": "Input data (rates, event payloads, headers) flows through filtering and selection functions; 'validate_webhook' processes headers and payload to verify authenticity.",
  "anomalies": "The HMAC signature verification uses standard libraries and appears correct; no hardcoded secrets or credentials present; no unusual or obfuscated code detected; no code execution or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for selecting lowest rates and verifying webhooks, with standard and secure practices. Rate selection functions filter data based on provided criteria and raise errors if no suitable rates are found. The 'validate_webhook' function normalizes secrets, computes HMAC signatures, and compares them securely. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed. Usage of 'json.loads' and 'hmac.compare_digest' aligns with best practices. No hardcoded credentials or potentially harmful code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data processing and security verification for a webhook-based system. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It appears to be well-structured, with appropriate security measures for webhook validation.",
