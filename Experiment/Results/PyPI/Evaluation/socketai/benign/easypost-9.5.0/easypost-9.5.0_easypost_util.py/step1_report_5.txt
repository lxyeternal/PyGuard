{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing shipping rates, validating webhooks, and handling EasyPost objects in a shipping application.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include HTTP headers, raw webhook payloads, and data within EasyPost objects such as rates and stateless rates.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include JSON parsing, HMAC signature verification, and raising exceptions on errors; no dangerous sinks like executing code or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (headers, raw webhook payloads, rate objects) through validation or filtering logic, ending in exception raising or returning processed objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The HMAC verification appears standard and correctly implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles rate filtering, rate selection, and webhook validation. Rate filtering functions compare input rates against criteria, raising errors if none match, which is expected. The webhook validation uses HMAC with a secret to verify authenticity, employing standard libraries and practices without hardcoded secrets or unusual operations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. All operations align with typical, secure API handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and secure. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injection. It performs legitimate functions related to rate filtering and webhook verification without suspicious activities.",
