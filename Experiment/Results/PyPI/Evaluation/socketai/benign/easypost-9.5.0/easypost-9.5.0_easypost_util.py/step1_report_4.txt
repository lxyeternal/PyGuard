  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing rates, processing events, and validating webhooks in the EasyPost API integration.",
  "sources": "Input data from webhooks (raw_input, headers, event_body), data from EasyPost objects and external rates.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if untrusted data influences rate filtering, or if webhook validation fails, allowing malicious webhook data to be processed.",
  "flows": "Webhook HTTP headers and body are processed for signature validation; rate data flows through filtering functions based on user input; data from external sources is processed for rate comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual variables. The webhook validation process appears standard and secure. No backdoors or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides rate filtering functions with standard practices, using case normalization and safe float conversions. Webhook validation employs HMAC with proper normalization, digest comparison, and exception handling. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The code relies on external modules for constants and objects, which are not shown but appear standard. No anomalies or malicious intent evident; the functions seem intended for legitimate rate management and webhook validation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation for rate filtering and webhook validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions follow best practices for security and data handling, with proper validation and exception management.",
