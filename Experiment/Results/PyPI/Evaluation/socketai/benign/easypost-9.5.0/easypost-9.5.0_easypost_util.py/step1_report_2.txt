{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling shipping rates and webhook validation within the EasyPost integration.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters (e.g., event_body, headers, rate lists, easypost_object), JSON deserialization in 'receive_event'.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write to external systems or perform dangerous operations directly; the 'validate_webhook' function performs cryptographic signature verification.",
  "flows": "Input data (raw JSON or headers) flows into signature validation or object processing; rates are retrieved and compared internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated or unusual code structures; standard use of cryptographic libraries. Signature validation correctly normalizes and compares signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides rate selection, object handling, and webhook validation functions with proper use of normalization, cryptography, and error handling. No signs of malicious or sabotage behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. It performs expected cryptographic verification and data filtering without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation for rate processing and webhook validation with no malicious intent or harmful behavior detected. It follows proper cryptographic practices and data handling procedures.",
