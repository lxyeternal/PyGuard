  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling shipping rates, webhooks, and event data in the EasyPost API integration.",
  "sources": "Input data from webhooks (raw_input, headers, event_body), rate objects, and dictionary/list data structures within functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data received from webhooks (event_body, headers), and external data sources like rate lists and event JSON.",
  "flows": "Webhook event data is received as raw input, validated with HMAC signature, then parsed into JSON; rate functions process rate data for filtering and selection.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook validation process involves normalizing and comparing HMAC signatures, which is standard. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No malicious behavior or backdoors detected. Code logic is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles rate filtering and webhook validation. Rate filtering functions process lists/dictionaries to find the lowest rates based on given criteria, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Webhook validation employs HMAC with a secret, normalizing the secret string before use, which is a common practice. The functions use proper exception handling for errors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activities are present. No signs of malware, such as data exfiltration or malicious commands, are detected. The code appears to be standard application logic for a shipping API integration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of rate filtering and webhook validation for an API integration. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It performs expected functions securely without obfuscated or suspicious code.",
