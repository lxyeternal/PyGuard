  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: utility functions for rate filtering, webhook validation, and event processing.\n- The code uses standard libraries (`json`, `hmac`, `hashlib`, `unicodedata`) with no signs of obfuscation.\n- The logic for rate filtering and webhook validation appears correct and secure.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code snippets are present.\n- The scores assigned to malware are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), which seems appropriate given the thorough reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are identified in the code snippets.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk.\n- **Potential assumptions:** The reports do not rely on assumptions about vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the cryptographic validation process.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The `validate_webhook` function normalizes the secret string before creating the HMAC, which is good practice.\n- Signature comparison uses `hmac.compare_digest`, preventing timing attacks.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is inferred from the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code appears clear and straightforward.\n**Risk score:** Given the context (webhook validation, rate filtering), the risk is minimal, but some potential for misconfiguration exists, so scores around 0.1-0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential misconfigurations or misuse, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard, secure, and free of malicious behavior. The scoring aligns well with the analysis. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and the risk is minimal.",
