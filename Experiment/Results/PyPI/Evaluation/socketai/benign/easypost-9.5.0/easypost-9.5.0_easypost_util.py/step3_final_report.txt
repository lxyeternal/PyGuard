{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for rate filtering and webhook validation, including cryptographic signature verification and event processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, JSON payloads, and HTTP headers.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions and data normalization; no direct data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (raw event body, headers, secrets) is processed through normalization, HMAC computation, and signature comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices (HMAC with normalization and secure digest comparison). It performs rate filtering with case-insensitive comparisons and float conversions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate, raising exceptions on invalid signatures or missing data. The overall structure is straightforward and adheres to security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of webhook validation and rate filtering functions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the detailed analysis and multiple reports.",
