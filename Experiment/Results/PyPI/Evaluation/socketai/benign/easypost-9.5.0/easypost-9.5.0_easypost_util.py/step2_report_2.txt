  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the described code snippets and their logic, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for rate filtering and webhook validation; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** Uses standard libraries (`json`, `hmac`, `hashlib`) for security; no hardcoded secrets; proper normalization and signature comparison.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, due to general webhooks handling).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cryptographic practices and data filtering.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, correct use of normalization and secure comparison.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focus on handling webhook validation and rate filtering; no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Proper use of normalization, HMAC, exception handling, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to the involvement of external data sources, but still no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Rate filtering and webhook validation; no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Standard practices, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with code and previous reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard rate filtering and webhook validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, proper security practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code snippets are straightforward, employing standard cryptographic and data handling practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as zero, which aligns with the code's clarity and standard library usage.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects minimal security concern, which is reasonable given the code's function.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code's core functionality—rate filtering and webhook validation—is inherently security-sensitive, but the implementation appears correct and secure.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The use of `unicodedata.normalize`, `hmac.compare_digest`, and proper exception handling indicates adherence to security best practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\nBased on all the information, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, readable code with no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, inherent to webhook validation functions but no significant security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented component of an API integration, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, considering the functions' purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1             |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's integrity and security posture.",
