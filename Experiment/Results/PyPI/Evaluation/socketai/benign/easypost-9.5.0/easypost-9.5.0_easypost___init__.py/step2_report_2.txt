  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippet consists solely of import statements and setting module-level metadata variables.\n- No data processing, user input handling, network activity, file operations, or system calls are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup or initialization code for a package interacting with the EasyPost API.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None detected.\n- **Security flaws:** None detected.\n- **Code quality issues:** None; the code is clean and standard for a module setup.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or indicators.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nAll reports consistently assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for obfuscated, malware, and security risk scores, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- No external inputs or outputs are handled.\n- The imports are from a known package and appear to be for configuration or setup purposes.\n\n### Potential points of contention:\n- Some reports mention \"reading configuration or sensitive data\" from imported modules. However, importing constants or functions does not, by itself, pose a security risk unless those modules contain secrets or malicious code. No such issues are evident here.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard setup code, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is straightforward, safe code. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review above.",
