{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up imports and metadata for an EasyPost API client module, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from easypost.constant, easypost.easypost_client, and easypost.util modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are evident within this snippet; it only imports constants and functions, and sets module metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and primarily imports and sets metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants, classes, and functions from the 'easypost' package, and assigns module-level metadata variables. There are no data inputs, external connections, or data processing logic shown that could pose security issues. The import statements are standard, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are evident. It does not contain any network activity, data handling, or code execution beyond imports.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module setup with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalous behaviors. It functions as part of a larger package setup and does not perform any harmful operations.",
