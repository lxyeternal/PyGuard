  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import modules and assign metadata variables; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and variable assignments for package metadata. No data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The imports are from a known SDK, and the code appears to be standard setup code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe module initialization snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
