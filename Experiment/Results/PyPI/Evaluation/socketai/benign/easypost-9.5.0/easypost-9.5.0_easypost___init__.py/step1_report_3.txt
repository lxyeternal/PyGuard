{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up imports and metadata for a Python package related to EasyPost API client functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'easypost.constant', 'easypost.easypost_client', and 'easypost.util' modules, which may include constants, classes, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; potential data leaks or malicious actions could occur if imported functions or constants are used improperly elsewhere, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly shown; the code only imports modules and assigns metadata variables. There are no runtime data flows or untrusted input handling in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, primarily importing components and setting metadata variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants, classes, and utility functions from the 'easypost' package. It assigns imported constants to module variables for author, version, and version info. There are no apparent data flows, user input, or malicious constructs. The code is typical of an initial module setup in a package. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware indications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup segment, importing constants and utilities for the EasyPost client library. It contains no malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
