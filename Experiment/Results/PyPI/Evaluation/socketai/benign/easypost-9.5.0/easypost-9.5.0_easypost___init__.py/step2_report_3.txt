  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup: importing constants, classes, and utility functions from the 'easypost' package, and assigning some metadata variables.\n- No evidence of data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of a standard package initialization or setup routine.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code snippet is minimal and only involves import statements and metadata assignments.\n- No actual data flows, external data, or system calls are present.\n- Based on the information, there are no signs of supply chain vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n**Potential points of contention:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements and variable assignments, a risk score higher than 0.1 would not be justified.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The confidence level is high (1) across reports, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no security issues detected.\n- The assigned scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action needed; the code snippet is safe and standard for a package setup.",
