  "purpose": "This code imports constants, classes, and functions from the 'easypost' package, likely for use in a larger application related to EasyPost API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'easypost.constant', 'easypost.easypost_client', and 'easypost.util'. No external inputs or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network connections, or file writing are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks are present in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code merely sets module-level variables and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and functions from an external package and sets module metadata variables. No dynamic execution, data handling, or system interaction occurs here. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure appears straightforward and standard for a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import and metadata assignment snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase utilizing the EasyPost API.",
