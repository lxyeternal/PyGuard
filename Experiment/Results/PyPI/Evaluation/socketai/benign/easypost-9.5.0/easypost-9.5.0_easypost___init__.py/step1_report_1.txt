  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module-level metadata and import various constants, classes, and utility functions related to the EasyPost API client.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'easypost.constant', 'easypost.easypost_client', and 'easypost.util' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls are present. The code only imports modules and assigns metadata variables.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of import statements and metadata assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants, classes, and utility functions from the 'easypost' package and sets module metadata variables. There is no evidence of data processing, input handling, or potential security risks. It appears to be standard setup code for a package or module initialization. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or secret credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module setup with imports and metadata assignments. It does not perform any malicious actions or handle untrusted data. No security issues are detected.",
