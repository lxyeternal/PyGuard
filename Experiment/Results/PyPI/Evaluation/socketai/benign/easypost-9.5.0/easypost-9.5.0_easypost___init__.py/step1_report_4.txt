{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import constants, classes, and utility functions related to the easypost package, likely for interacting with the EasyPost API.",
  "sources": "Imports from easypost.constant, easypost.easypost_client, and easypost.util modules, which may read configuration or sensitive data if these modules contain such logic.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration functions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly visible; the code only assigns imported constants to module-level variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code only performs imports and variable assignments without any dynamic or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants, classes, and utility functions from the easypost package, and assigns some imported constants to module variables. There is no indication of data processing, input reading, or network activity. The imported items appear to be standard for a client SDK, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with imports and variable assignments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this snippet.",
