  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet consists solely of import statements and assignment of metadata variables.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, file operations, or system calls are present.\n- The code appears to be standard setup code for a Python package/module.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and typical for a package initialization.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code does not contain any security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as expected.\n- **Risk score:** Zero, given the benign nature.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external interactions.\n- The import modules are standard and seem to be part of the EasyPost SDK.\n- No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, safe module setup with no security concerns. The scores and conclusions in the reports are justified and should remain as is.",
