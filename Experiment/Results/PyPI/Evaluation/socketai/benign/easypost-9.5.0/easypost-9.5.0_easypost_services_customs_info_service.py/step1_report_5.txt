{
  "purpose": "This code defines a service class for managing CustomsInfo resources via an API client.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'params' argument in the create method and the 'id' argument in the retrieve method.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is passed into create or retrieve, leading to unintended API calls or data exposure.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'params' flows into '_create_resource', and 'id' flows into '_retrieve_resource', both methods likely sending requests to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of __name__ for model class is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a service class with methods to create and retrieve CustomsInfo objects. It imports models and base services, and uses class initialization to store client and model info. The methods pass parameters directly to internal resource handling functions. No indicators of malicious activity, hidden behaviors, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a typical API client wrapper with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a service class interfacing with an API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. It simply manages resource creation and retrieval with no evident security concerns.",
