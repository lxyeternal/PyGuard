{
  "purpose": "The code defines a service class for handling CustomsInfo resources in an easypost API client, providing methods to create and retrieve CustomsInfo objects.",
  "sources": "The class uses input parameters from method calls (__init__, create, retrieve) and the client object passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from method parameters to internal resource creation or retrieval functions, possibly involving network communication via the client object.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like 'id' in retrieve or 'params' in create) flow into internal methods (_create_resource, _retrieve_resource), which likely communicate with external services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or unusual patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a service layer.",
  "analysis": "The code imports models and base services, then defines a class with methods to create and retrieve CustomsInfo objects. The methods delegate to internal functions, likely performing network calls. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of the client object is typical for API services. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a service class for an API client, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for such a context.",
