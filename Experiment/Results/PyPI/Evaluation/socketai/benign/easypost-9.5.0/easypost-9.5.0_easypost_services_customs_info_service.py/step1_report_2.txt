{
  "purpose": "Define a service class for managing CustomsInfo resources via an API client.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'client' parameter during initialization, uses CustomsInfo.__name__ to specify model class, and accepts parameters for resource creation.",
  "sinks": "The code calls internal methods _create_resource and _retrieve_resource, which are potential points where data could be sent to external systems or databases.",
  "flows": "Input parameters for create() are passed directly to _create_resource; the retrieve() method uses an ID parameter, which could originate from external input. These flow into internal resource handling methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper around API calls with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a service class that manages CustomsInfo resources, with methods to create and retrieve resources. It relies on internal methods _create_resource and _retrieve_resource, which are not shown but likely handle API communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured service layer implementation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical API wrapper for resource management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
