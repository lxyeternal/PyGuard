{
  "purpose": "This code defines a service class for managing CustomsInfo resources via an API, providing methods to create and retrieve CustomsInfo objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'client' parameter during class initialization and uses it internally; it also references CustomsInfo model for object creation and retrieval.",
  "sinks": "The methods use internal functions '_create_resource' and '_retrieve_resource', which are likely to interact with external systems or APIs; however, no direct sinks like network calls or data leaks are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('params' for create and 'id' for retrieve) flow into internal methods that handle resource creation and retrieval; data flows from these parameters to the underlying resource management functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code structure appears straightforward and typical for service classes. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious intent is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports models and base service classes, then defines a service class for CustomsInfo. It initializes with a client object, which is stored for use in resource operations. The 'create' method constructs a new CustomsInfo resource with provided parameters, while 'retrieve' fetches an existing resource by ID. No data manipulation, user input sanitization, or insecure operations are visible. The reliance on internal methods ('_create_resource' and '_retrieve_resource') suggests standard API interactions, but their implementations are not provided. Overall, this appears to be a typical, well-structured service class without suspicious or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a service class for handling CustomsInfo resources, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
