  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a `CustomsInfoService` class for managing CustomsInfo resources.\n- Uses an API client passed during initialization.\n- Provides `create` and `retrieve` methods that delegate to internal functions `_create_resource` and `_retrieve_resource`.\n- Imports models and base service classes.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The internal methods are not shown, but their naming suggests standard API interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper for resource management.\n- No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are visible.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- No evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or code injection.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The report notes that the internal methods `_create_resource` and `_retrieve_resource` are not shown, so the security of data handling depends on their implementation.\n- The code relies on external functions for security, but nothing indicates these are insecure.\n- The code does not perform input validation or sanitization explicitly, but this is typical for such wrapper classes; validation might be handled elsewhere.\n\n### Scores review:\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0, correctly indicating clear code.\n- Risk scores: mostly 0.1-0.2, which are low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. Given the code's simplicity and the lack of suspicious patterns, the low scores are justified.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since the code is a simple API wrapper, the main concern would be if the internal methods `_create_resource` and `_retrieve_resource` are insecure or malicious. However, their absence from the snippet and the reports' consensus suggest they are standard implementations.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent, so a risk score higher than 0.2 would be unwarranted.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed as 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the security of data depends on the internal methods, but there's no evidence to assume these are insecure.\n- No indication of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured service class for resource management.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to external dependencies and unshown internal methods, but nothing suspicious)\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThe code appears benign and secure based on the provided snippet and reports. The low scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
