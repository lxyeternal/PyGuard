{
  "purpose": "API wrapper class for managing CustomsInfo resources via an external client, providing create and retrieve functionalities.",
  "sources": "Initialization with client object; parameters passed to create method; resource ID passed to retrieve method.",
  "sinks": "Delegation to internal methods _create_resource and _retrieve_resource; no direct sinks in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into internal methods for resource creation or retrieval; no external data leaks or malicious flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; reliance on external internal methods whose security is not shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API service class that delegates core operations to inherited methods. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The security of the overall system depends on the implementation of the internal methods, which are not provided, but the visible code itself is benign. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured.",
