{
  "purpose": "The code implements a request handler for interacting with the EasyPost API, including request preparation, sending, and response interpretation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters, environment info via platform module, and configuration attributes such as API keys.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include usage of API keys in headers, request payloads, and URL parameters; network requests to external services; and the handling of response data.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters, environment info) -> request construction (headers, URL, body) -> network request -> response handling -> error processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; request URLs are constructed from base URL and parameters, but no suspicious domain or code injection is evident; exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs and sends HTTP requests to a specified API, using environment info for headers and encoding parameters carefully. It uses standard libraries and practices for network communication and error handling. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden payloads. The only potential concern could be the handling of API keys, but they are stored in the client object and used in headers, which is standard for authenticated API requests. The code does not include any suspicious code flows, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. All functions perform typical request management tasks with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API request handler with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected tasks securely, with appropriate error handling and environment info gathering. No malware or security risks are evident.",
