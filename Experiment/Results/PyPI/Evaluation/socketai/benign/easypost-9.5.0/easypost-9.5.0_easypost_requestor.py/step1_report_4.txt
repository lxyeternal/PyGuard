{
  "purpose": "This code implements a request handler for the EasyPost API, managing HTTP requests, response interpretation, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method parameters, environment info for user-agent, and configuration attributes like API keys and URLs.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to external servers via HTTP requests, and internal request logging and hooks could potentially leak data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters and environment info through request construction, request execution, and response handling to outputs and hooks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Usage of environment info is standard. Request construction and error handling are typical. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs HTTP requests with proper headers, handles different request methods, and interprets responses, raising specific errors for HTTP issues. User-agent string construction uses system info but is standard. No signs of code injection, data leaks, or hidden backdoors. The code manages errors gracefully and logs request details via hooks, but these are expected features. No suspicious data exfiltration or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate request handler for API communication with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard patterns for API interaction and error handling without any suspicious modifications or backdoors.",
