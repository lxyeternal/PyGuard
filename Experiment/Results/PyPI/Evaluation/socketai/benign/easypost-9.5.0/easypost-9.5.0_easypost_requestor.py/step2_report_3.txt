  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, consistency of scores, and potential security risks.\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard API request handler for EasyPost, involving request construction, parameter encoding, response interpretation, and error handling.\n- They emphasize that the code uses environment info for headers, manages request lifecycle securely, and does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic behaviors.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2), indicating no malicious activity or sabotage detected.\n- Confidence levels are high (~0.9-0.95), reinforcing the assessment that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Flaws:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports find any signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard libraries, handles errors gracefully, and constructs requests securely.\n- **Request Handling & Environment Info:** Usage of platform info, UUIDs, and environment variables is standard for client identification, not malicious.\n- **API Key Handling:** API keys are stored in the client object and used in headers, which is typical for authenticated API clients.\n- **Error Handling:** Properly maps HTTP status codes to exceptions, with no suspicious exception patterns.\n- **Network Requests:** Use of `requests` or `urlfetch` libraries with try-except blocks to handle timeouts and errors is standard.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; no logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- They correctly identify that the code does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low given the benign nature.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscated code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher (~0.1-0.2) due to potential concerns about data leakage via request/response logging, but overall low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the detailed analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the code appears secure and benign.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, standard, and non-obfuscated.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to external request handling and logging considerations, but no significant security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured API client component with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The high confidence and low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are accurate; no malicious activity or obfuscation is present.  \n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.  \n- The code is secure, standard, and unlikely to pose any security threat.",
