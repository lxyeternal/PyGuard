{
  "purpose": "This code implements a request handler for interacting with the EasyPost API, managing request creation, parameter encoding, response interpretation, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method parameters (params, method, url), environment info (platform, datetime), and client configuration (api_key, api_base, request hooks).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could reach network requests (requests or urlfetch) with potentially manipulated headers or params; error messages could leak details if not properly sanitized.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through _objects_to_ids -> request_raw -> request methods, ultimately reaching network requests; response data flows back through interpret_response to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or backdoors detected. Usage of platform info gathering and UUIDs appear standard. No obfuscated code observed. The code appropriately handles errors and logs request details without apparent data leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs API requests, encodes parameters, and interprets responses. No malicious behavior such as unauthorized data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors is evident. The only potential concern is the logging of request/response details, which should be controlled to prevent leakage of sensitive info, but no explicit sensitive data is handled here. The usage of platform info is standard for client identification. No suspicious or malicious code paths or obfuscated sections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API request handler without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It correctly manages request lifecycle, error handling, and data encoding. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
