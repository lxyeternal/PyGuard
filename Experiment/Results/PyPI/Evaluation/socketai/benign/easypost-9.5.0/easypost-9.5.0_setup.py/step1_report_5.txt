{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'easypost', including dependencies, metadata, and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "File reading 'README.md' for long description, hardcoded package dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; no user input or external data processing is present.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> Assign long_description; define package metadata and dependencies -> Pass to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The dependencies are pinned versions, which is typical for reproducibility, not malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of package setup instructions using setuptools. It loads a markdown file for description, specifies dependencies with version pins, and defines metadata for distribution. There are no apparent malicious code segments, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. All code appears to serve legitimate package configuration purposes. No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs are present, and no anomalies or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The script is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
