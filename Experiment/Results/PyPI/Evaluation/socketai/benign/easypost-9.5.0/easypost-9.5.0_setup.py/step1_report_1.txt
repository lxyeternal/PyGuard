  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and configuring the packaging of the 'easypost' Python library, including dependencies and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file, hardcoded package data, requirements lists, and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup()' to define package installation, dependencies, and metadata; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> sets package configuration -> executes setup() with collected parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard Python package setup patterns using setuptools. It reads the long description from a file, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and sets project metadata. No code injection, unsafe execution, or malicious activities are present. All dependencies and parameters appear to be well-defined for typical package setup purposes. No anomalies or suspicious flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It functions solely to package and distribute the 'easypost' library.",
