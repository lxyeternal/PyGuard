  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior. It notes that the code reads from a file, defines dependencies, and calls `setup()` with static data. No untrusted input, code injection, or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent with the benign nature of the script.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the script is a straightforward package setup with explicit dependencies and no external input or dynamic code execution. The dependencies are pinned explicitly, which reduces risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity. It emphasizes the static nature of dependencies and the absence of external input handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with previous reports. No dynamic or untrusted data handling, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, and explicit dependencies.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a conventional, static setup script for packaging a Python library. All dependencies are explicitly pinned, no external or untrusted data is processed, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious flows. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis package setup script is benign and poses no security threat based on the provided code and reports.",
