{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'easypost'. It defines dependencies, package metadata, and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the contents of 'README.md' for the long description; reads dependencies from the code itself (hardcoded lists). No external input sources or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup()' to process and install the package; no untrusted data is passed or handled that could lead to code injection or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' -> passes static data to setup() for packaging; no dynamic or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected. The code primarily consists of static configuration and dependency declarations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup using setuptools, with dependencies specified explicitly and package metadata defined. No external input processing, no code execution based on untrusted data, and no suspicious or obfuscated code present. All dependencies are pinned or version-specified explicitly, reducing risk of malicious dependency behavior. The code lacks any dynamic execution or user input handling. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward, benign setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs typical package installation procedures without external input or suspicious patterns.",
