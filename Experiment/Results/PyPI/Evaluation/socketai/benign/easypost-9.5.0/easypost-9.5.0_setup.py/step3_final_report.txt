{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, defining dependencies, metadata, and configuration for packaging.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines dependencies in REQUIREMENTS and DEV_REQUIREMENTS lists; static data in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no dynamic code execution or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from variables into setup() parameters; no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows common packaging patterns; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with explicit dependency pinning and static configuration. It reads a README file for description, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic or untrusted data processing, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The explicit version pins and comments indicate careful dependency management. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code structure and content align with best practices for package distribution, and all dependencies are explicitly pinned, reducing dependency-related risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and static nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
