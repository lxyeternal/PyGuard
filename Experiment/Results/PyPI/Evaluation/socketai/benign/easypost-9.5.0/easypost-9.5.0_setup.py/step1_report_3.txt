{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'easypost' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and distribution settings.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; importing functions from setuptools; hardcoded dependency lists; static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data or user input handling, no data leaks, or unsafe code execution points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; dependencies and metadata are statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that defines dependencies, package info, and metadata. It reads a static README file and specifies dependencies with fixed versions. No external input handling or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies are well-defined with comments indicating version pins for stability. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and appropriate for package distribution.",
