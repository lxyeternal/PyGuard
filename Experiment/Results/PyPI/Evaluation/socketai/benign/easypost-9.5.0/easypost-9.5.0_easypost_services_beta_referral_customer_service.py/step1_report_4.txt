{
  "purpose": "Provides methods for managing referral customer payment methods and refunds via the EasyPost API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as stripe_customer_id, payment_method_reference, refund_amount, payment_log_id.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests made via Requestor.request() to specific API endpoints with parameters constructed from input data.",
  "flows": "Input data (sources) are wrapped into request parameters, then sent through HTTP requests to API endpoints; responses are converted to EasyPost objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of beta endpoints indicates experimental features but not malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to add payment methods and process refunds through an API. Input parameters are straightforward and are used to construct request payloads. Requests are made via a Requestor object with a 'beta' flag, indicating they are for beta features but do not suggest malicious activity. The code does not contain any network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It primarily performs standard API interactions. No hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard API client code for managing referral payments and refunds with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles input parameters and makes API requests with no suspicious operations.",
