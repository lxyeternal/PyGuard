  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is a straightforward API client wrapper for managing referral customer payment methods and refunds. They note no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious control flow, or malicious patterns. The code's purpose aligns with standard SDK or API client practices.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**  \n   The code appears correct and well-structured for its intended purpose. It wraps parameters and makes API requests without evident logical errors. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of 'beta=True', which suggests these endpoints are experimental, but that does not imply maliciousness.\n\n3. **Scores Given in Reports:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0.2, which is a cautious but acceptable score given the use of beta endpoints and handling sensitive data.\n\n   **Suggestion:** The security risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate; it reflects caution due to beta features but not a significant threat.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate. The code does handle sensitive payment data, but it does so in a standard, expected manner.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. No evidence suggests malware or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious but do not make unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the use of beta endpoints but do not infer malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: no obfuscation, no malware, and a low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No signs of malware or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slight caution due to beta endpoints and handling sensitive data, but overall low risk.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code functions as a typical API client for managing referral payments and refunds. It handles sensitive data but does so securely and transparently. The use of beta endpoints warrants some caution but does not elevate the risk to a high level. No malicious activity or security flaws are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report's assessments are accurate. The code is safe, and the low scores are justified. No changes are necessary.",
