  "purpose": "API client wrapper for managing referral customer payment methods and refunds via the EasyPost API.",
  "sources": "Method arguments providing IDs and amounts; data sent over network requests to specific endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external API endpoints with user-provided parameters.",
  "flows": "Parameters are wrapped into request payloads and transmitted via POST requests to designated URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; use of 'beta=True' endpoints noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client that wraps parameters and makes network requests for payment and refund operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws are evident. The use of beta endpoints indicates experimental features but does not imply malicious intent. The parameters involve sensitive payment data but are handled in a standard manner. No suspicious logic, data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected. The code's clarity and purpose align with typical SDK practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate API client for managing referral payments and refunds. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering the handling of sensitive data and use of beta features. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy.",
