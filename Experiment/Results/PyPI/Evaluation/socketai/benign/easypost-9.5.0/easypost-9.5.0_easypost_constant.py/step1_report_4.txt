  "purpose": "Define configuration constants, error messages, and internal constants for EasyPost API client.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments, string definitions, and list initializations",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data; static strings are used for error messages and configuration",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets static variables",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions for API configuration, error messages, and internal constants. No input reading, data processing, or external interactions are present. All strings are static, and there are no functions or executable logic that could be exploited or manipulated. The constants seem to serve as configuration and error messaging for the client library, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration and messaging module without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
