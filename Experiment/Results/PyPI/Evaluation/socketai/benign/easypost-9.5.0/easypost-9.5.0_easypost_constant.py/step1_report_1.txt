  "purpose": "Define configuration constants, error messages, and internal parameters for the EasyPost API client library.",
  "sources": "Constants and string definitions used throughout the client code.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes untrusted input or outputs sensitive data; mostly static definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or unusual runtime behavior. The internal constants and error messages are standard for API client libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains static constant definitions, error message templates, and configuration parameters for an API client. It does not include data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The constants, such as URLs and email addresses, are typical for a service SDK. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected. The internal constants are for internal use only and do not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration and message definition module for the EasyPost API client. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
