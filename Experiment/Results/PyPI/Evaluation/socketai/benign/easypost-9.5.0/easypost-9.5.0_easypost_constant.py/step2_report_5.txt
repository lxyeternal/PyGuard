  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It consists solely of static constant definitions, error message templates, configuration parameters, and internal constants.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network communication, or user input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The variables include URLs, emails, version info, and error messages, all standard for an SDK or API client library.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Purpose: Configuration constants and error messages.  \n   - Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static data, no data flow.  \n   - Anomalies: None observed.  \n   - Analysis: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets.  \n   - Conclusion: Benign, standard SDK setup.  \n   - Confidence: 1; Malware: 0; Security risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static strings and configuration.  \n   - No untrusted data, no secrets, no suspicious patterns.  \n   - Conclusion: No malicious activity.  \n   - Confidence: 1; Malware: 0; Security risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Same findings: static constants, no dynamic code or secrets.  \n   - No signs of malicious behavior.  \n   - Conclusion: Safe configuration code.  \n   - Confidence: 1; Malware: 0; Security risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Similar analysis: static, configuration-only code, no secrets or obfuscation.  \n   - No malicious indicators.  \n   - Conclusion: Non-malicious setup code.  \n   - Confidence: 1; Malware: 0; Security risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Same as above: static constants, no external data, no secrets, no suspicious patterns.  \n   - Conclusion: Benign configuration code.  \n   - Confidence: 1; Malware: 0; Security risk: 0.  \n   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely static configuration and message definitions.\n- **Malicious behavior or malware:** None detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard, benign configuration module for an SDK.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n- The detailed analysis aligns with the evidence.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
