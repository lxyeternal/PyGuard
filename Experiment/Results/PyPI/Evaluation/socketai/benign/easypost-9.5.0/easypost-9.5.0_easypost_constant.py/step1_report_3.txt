  "purpose": "Define constants, error messages, and configuration parameters for the EasyPost API client library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; only static variables and constants are defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely sets up constants and error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. Constants and error messages are standard, with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of variable assignments for configuration, error messages, and internal constants. No user input handling, external data processing, or function calls are present. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The presence of detailed error messages and static configuration suggests typical library setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration and message definition module for an API client library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
