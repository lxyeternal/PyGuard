  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the code provided.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of static constant definitions, error message templates, configuration parameters, and internal constants.\n- No dynamic code, input processing, network communication, or executable logic is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns are observed.\n- The constants and messages are typical for an API client library.\n- The URLs, emails, and version info are publicly available and non-sensitive.\n- The internal constants serve configuration purposes only.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of the Reports:\n\n**Report 1 to 5:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static configuration and messaging definitions.\n- They note the absence of any suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The malware scores are all 0, consistent with no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the lack of any security concerns.\n\n**Any issues or discrepancies?**\n- No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores and Claims:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly 0 across all reports. No malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All 0, which is appropriate given the static, non-sensitive nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5?\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is purely configuration with no dynamic or executable components.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions?\n- The reports correctly challenge any claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions. They rightly state that the code does not process untrusted input or output sensitive data, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven all the above, **my own estimates** for the scores are:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign configuration module for the EasyPost API client. There are no signs of supply chain risks, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
