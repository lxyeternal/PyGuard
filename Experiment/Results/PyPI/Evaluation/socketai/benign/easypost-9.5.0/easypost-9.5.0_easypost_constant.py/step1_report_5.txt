  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration, and error messages for the EasyPost API client library.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and string assignments; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; no external data outputs or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static constant values used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration constants, error messages, and internal variables for the library. It includes version info, API URLs, support emails, error message templates, and internal class lists. There are no input handling, dynamic code execution, or external data interactions. The constants and messages are standard, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. All variables and strings are non-sensitive and appear to serve normal library functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and messaging setup for an API client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and intended for normal operational purposes.",
