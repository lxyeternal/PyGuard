  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of static constant definitions, error message templates, configuration parameters, and internal class/list constants.\n- No functions, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code snippets are detected.\n- The constants include URLs, emails, and error messages, all of which are typical for a client SDK.\n- The code is straightforward and appears to serve as configuration and messaging setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is purely static configuration; there are no processing steps, inputs, or outputs that could be exploited.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors.\n- The reported \"sources\" and \"sinks\" in each report align with the code's static nature.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- The internal constants and error messages are standard and do not pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration and message definitions.\n- They all conclude that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- No inaccuracies or overstatements are present in their reasoning.\n\n**No issues with the logical reasoning of the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores assigned in the reports:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n- Since no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard configuration module with no malicious intent.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate and align with the actual code content. The overall security assessment should remain at zero risk, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
