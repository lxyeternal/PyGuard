  "purpose": "Static configuration constants, error message templates, internal parameters, and version info for the EasyPost API client library.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only static variable definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process data or execute logic, only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants, configuration parameters, and internal lists. There are no functions, dynamic code, input handling, or network interactions. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are present. The constants are typical for an SDK setup, and the structure indicates a benign configuration module. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks are evident. The code's static nature and lack of dynamic or external interactions support a conclusion of safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for the EasyPost SDK, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence points to it being a standard setup component without any supply chain or malicious concerns.",
