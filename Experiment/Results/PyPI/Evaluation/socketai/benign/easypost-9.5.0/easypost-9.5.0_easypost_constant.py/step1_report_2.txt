{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, configuration parameters, and error messages for the EasyPost API client library.",
  "sources": "No input sources; primarily static assignment of strings, lists, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or command execution points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is purely configuration and message definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious logic, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. Constants and messages are standard for an API client.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes configuration variables, constants, and error messages for an API client. It uses only static string assignments and lists with no dynamic code execution, no input handling, or data processing. The only potentially sensitive data is the support email and API base URL, which are publicly available and not secret. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage is present. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or malicious payloads identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module defining constants and messages for the EasyPost API client. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to serve its purpose without any malicious or suspicious features.",
