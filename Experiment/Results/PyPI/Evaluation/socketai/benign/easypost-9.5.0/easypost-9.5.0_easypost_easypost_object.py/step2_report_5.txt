  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the dynamic import mechanism based on response data, especially 'object' and 'id' fields, which could be exploited if response data is malicious. The mappings and controlled class names mitigate risk. No malware or malicious behavior identified.\n\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Risk 0.2, Malware 0.0.  \n  These seem reasonable given the potential for dynamic import abuse but the presence of controlled mappings reduces actual risk.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the main concern—the dynamic import based on response data—and notes that the risk is mitigated by static mappings. No evidence of malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that dynamic import via 'importlib' could be exploited if response data is malicious. No signs of malware or malicious code. The risk is moderate, mainly due to dynamic import.\n\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.4, Malware 0.0.  \n  Slightly higher risk score than Report 1, possibly reflecting the acknowledgment of the dynamic import as a potential attack vector.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No malware, but the dynamic import mechanism warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, focuses on dynamic import and attribute setting. Finds no hardcoded secrets or malicious code, but notes that response data manipulation could be exploited.\n\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.2, Malware 0.0.  \n  Consistent with the analysis that the code is low risk but has a potential attack surface via dynamic import.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly concludes low risk, with no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that dynamic import based on response data could be exploited if data is malicious. No malicious behavior observed.\n\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.4, Malware 0.0.  \n  Slightly higher risk score, consistent with the potential for exploitation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code's design is typical for SDKs with dynamic models, with no malware evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the dynamic class import, potential risks if response data is manipulated, but no evidence of malicious activity. The code is standard for SDKs.\n\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.2, Malware 0.0.  \n  Appropriate given the context.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and cautious, recognizing the potential risk but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** The code dynamically imports modules based on response data, which could be exploited if response data is maliciously crafted. However, the mappings and controlled class names limit this risk.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate. No signs of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct; the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 across reports, reflecting the potential attack surface due to dynamic imports but no actual exploitation or malware.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0.0** — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Considering the potential for exploitation via dynamic import if response data is malicious, I would assign a **risk score of approximately 0.3**. This reflects a low but non-negligible risk, especially if response data can be influenced by an attacker.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0                    |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Risk             | 0.3                    |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is primarily safe and well-structured for its purpose, with the main concern being the dynamic import mechanism. Proper validation or whitelisting of class names and response data can mitigate this risk further. No malware or malicious intent is evident.",
