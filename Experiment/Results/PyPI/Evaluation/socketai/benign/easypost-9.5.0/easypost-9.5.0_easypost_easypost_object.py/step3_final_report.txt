  "purpose": "Convert API response data into structured EasyPostObject instances with dynamic class instantiation based on response content.",
  "sources": "Response dictionary fields 'object' and 'id' that provide type information; response data passed to convert_to_easypost_object.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via importlib.import_module, which loads modules based on response-derived class names; potential for exploitation if response data is malicious.",
  "flows": "Response data's 'object' or 'id' fields determine class name; class name used to import module; construct_from creates object; convert_each_value populates attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of response data to determine module import path introduces risk; no explicit validation or sanitization of response data before import.",
  "analysis": "The code employs dynamic class import based on response 'object' and 'id' fields, with mappings controlling class names. While this pattern is common in SDKs, it can be exploited if response data is manipulated. The mappings limit class names, reducing the attack surface. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.2-0.4) are appropriate, reflecting a low to moderate risk primarily due to dynamic import potential. Proper validation of response data can further mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for dynamic response handling with controlled class instantiation. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main concern is the dynamic import mechanism, which should be safeguarded with input validation. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use with appropriate precautions.",
