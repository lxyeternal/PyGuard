  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code uses dynamic class import based on response data, which could be exploited if response data is malicious. The mappings limit the class names, reducing risk.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malware. The dynamic import is a potential attack vector if response data is untrusted, but mappings mitigate this.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, which seems reasonable given the controlled dynamic import.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the dynamic import based on response data. Potential risk if response data is malicious.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior observed. The risk is moderate due to dynamic import, but overall low.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.4, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The code converts responses into objects with dynamic class import. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic import could be exploited if response data is manipulated, but the mappings and controls seem sufficient.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, consistent with the report.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with focus on dynamic import risks.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, but dynamic import mechanism warrants caution.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.4, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, dynamic class import based on response data, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No malware, risk is inherent but controlled.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting the potential risk due to dynamic imports but controlled via mappings.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The dynamic import mechanism is a potential attack vector if response data is untrusted. However, the code's design with mappings and controlled class names mitigates this.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 - 0.4 (moderate, due to dynamic import, but mitigated)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard implementation for dynamic API response handling with controlled class instantiation. While the dynamic import pattern can be exploited if response data is malicious, the current mappings and controls significantly reduce this risk. No malware or malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Final malware score: 0**  \n**Final obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Final risk score: 0.2**",
