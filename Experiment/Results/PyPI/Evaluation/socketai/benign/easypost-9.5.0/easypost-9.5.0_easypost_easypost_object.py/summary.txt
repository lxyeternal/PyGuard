  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for dynamic response handling with controlled class instantiation. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main concern is the dynamic import mechanism, which should be safeguarded with input validation. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use with appropriate precautions."
