{
  "purpose": "The code prepares a machine learning model graph for post-training quantization, including statistics collection, graph transformations, and quantization parameter calculation.",
  "sources": "representative_data_gen (dataset generator), graph (model representation), fw_impl (framework-specific methods), fw_info (framework info), core_config (configuration parameters), hessian_info_service (optional Hessian-based scores), tb_w (optional tensorboard logger)",
  "sinks": "Potentially modified graph object, but no data sinks or untrusted data outputs are explicitly present",
  "flows": "Input data from representative_data_gen flows through infer() calls in ModelCollector, influencing graph transformations, quantization parameter calculations, and substitutions; no external data leaks or harmful effects are evident",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Usage of tqdm for progress display is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically performs model optimization, statistics collection, and quantization parameter computation. It uses standard libraries and well-structured functions, with no signs of data leakage, malicious network activity, or harmful operations. The focus is on model processing and visualization, with optional logging. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident. All data flows appear contained within model processing pipeline, with no external communication or file operations that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of post-training quantization preparation. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
