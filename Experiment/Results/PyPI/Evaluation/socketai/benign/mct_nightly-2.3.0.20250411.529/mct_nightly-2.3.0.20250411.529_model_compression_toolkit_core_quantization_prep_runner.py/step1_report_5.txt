{
  "purpose": "The code prepares a trained model for post-training quantization by collecting statistics, editing the network graph, calculating quantization parameters, and applying substitutions and corrections to optimize the model.",
  "sources": "representative_data_gen (dataset generator), graph (model graph), fw_impl (framework-specific methods), hessian_info_service (Hessian scores), core_config (configuration parameters), tb_w (Tensorboard writer for logging)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external systems, network, or files in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "Data from representative_data_gen flows through mi.infer for statistics collection, then the graph is edited and quantization parameters are computed, followed by substitutions and corrections, with optional logging via tb_w.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations are present. The code appears to follow a typical model quantization workflow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs model graph optimization, statistics collection, and quantization parameter computation using standard practices and well-documented methods. It includes optional logging and graph modifications based on configuration. No suspicious or malicious behavior, network activity, or data leakage is evident. All operations relate to model processing for quantization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard model quantization preparation script with no signs of malicious behavior. It strictly performs model transformation, statistics collection, and configuration updates without any suspicious side effects.",
