{
  "purpose": "The code prepares a machine learning model graph for post-training quantization, including collecting statistics, editing the graph, calculating quantization parameters, and applying transformations.",
  "sources": "representative_data_gen() (data generation), graph (model graph), fw_impl (framework-specific methods), core_config, fw_info, hessian_info_service, tb_w (optional logging)",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; the code mainly processes data and modifies model graph without external data leakage or malicious effects",
  "flows": "Data from representative_data_gen() flows into infer() for statistics collection, then through graph editing, quantization parameter calculation, substitutions, and optional negative activation shift, ending in returning a processed graph",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard procedures for model quantization preparation, including collecting statistics, applying graph transformations, and optional corrections. The use of tqdm for progress indication and optional Tensorboard logging appears normal. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious system manipulations are evident. Functions are well-structured, and external inputs are handled through provided functions and objects. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a model quantization pipeline without malicious intent. It performs standard operations for preparing a model for quantization with no suspicious activity detected.",
