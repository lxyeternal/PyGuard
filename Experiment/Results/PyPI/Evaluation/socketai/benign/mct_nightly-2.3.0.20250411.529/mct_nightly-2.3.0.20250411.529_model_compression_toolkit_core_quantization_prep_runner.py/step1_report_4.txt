{
  "purpose": "The function prepares a trained model graph for post-training quantization by collecting statistics, editing the graph, calculating quantization parameters, and applying substitutions.",
  "sources": "Representative data generator (representative_data_gen), model graph (graph), optional Tensorboard writer (tb_w), and Hessian info service (hessian_info_service).",
  "sinks": "The code primarily performs model analysis and transformations; no evident sinks that handle untrusted input data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from representative_data_gen through infer() calls to model collector, then through graph edits, quantization parameter calculation, and substitutions, finally returning a modified graph.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of tqdm for progress indication is benign. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code follows a standard pattern for model quantization preparation, including statistic collection, graph editing, substitution, and optional correction steps. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of external libraries like tqdm and function calls are typical for such workflows. No suspicious data handling or external network activity is present. The code maintains clear separation of concerns, and all steps are related to model quantization, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and safe, focusing on model quantization preparation. No malicious behavior or security risks identified based on the provided code. It is a typical implementation for model optimization workflows.",
