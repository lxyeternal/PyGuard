{
  "purpose": "The code prepares a neural network graph for post-training quantization, including collecting statistics, editing the network graph, calculating quantization parameters, applying substitutions, and performing statistical correction.",
  "sources": "Representative data generator (representative_data_gen), model graph input (graph), configuration objects (core_config, fw_info, fw_impl), optional TensorboardWriter (tb_w), Hessian info service (hessian_info_service).",
  "sinks": "Data collection during inference (mi.infer), graph editing functions (edit_network_graph), quantization parameter calculation (calculate_quantization_params), substitution application (substitute), negative shift correction (fw_impl.shift_negative_correction), statistics correction runner (statistics_correction_runner).",
  "flows": "Input data flows from representative_data_gen to infer method of ModelCollector; graph is modified at various stages through functions like edit_network_graph, calculate_quantization_params, substitute, shift_negative_correction, and statistics_correction_runner.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; usage of third-party libraries (tqdm) appears standard; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution; no suspicious network calls or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured model preparation for quantization, involving multiple stages of data collection, graph editing, parameter calculation, substitution, and correction. All operations use standard functions and clearly documented steps, with no signs of hidden or malicious code. The external dependencies are typical for such tasks and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or network communications are present. The structure and function calls align with standard model quantization workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a model quantization preparation pipeline with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly performs model graph modifications, data collection, and quantization calculations without suspicious activities.",
