  "purpose": "This code implements a model quantization pipeline, including graph optimization, calibration, resource estimation, and mixed-precision configuration, to prepare a trained model for efficient inference.",
  "sources": "Input model, representative data generator, configuration objects, and internal graph structures.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, configuration modifications, and internal graph updates; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input model and data generator through graph preparation, calibration, resource analysis, and configuration steps, culminating in graph modifications and resource utilization summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard practices for model quantization and resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model quantization tasks, including graph optimization, calibration, mixed-precision search, and resource utilization calculation. It employs typical logging and configuration handling without external network activity or suspicious data flows. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The functions and data flows are consistent with legitimate model compression workflows, and the security considerations are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a model quantization and optimization pipeline, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk are appropriate and justified.",
