  "purpose": "This code imports modules and functions from the 'model_compression_toolkit' package for purposes related to model compression, quantization, and infrastructure setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'model_compression_toolkit' package modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network operations, file writes, or environment variable usage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly consists of import statements and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or unusual code activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports various modules and functions from a well-known package ('model_compression_toolkit') related to model compression techniques. It sets a version string. There are no indications of data handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident in these imports or version assignment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard import/setup script for a model compression toolkit, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
