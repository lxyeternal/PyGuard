  "purpose": "Import statements for the model compression toolkit modules and version declaration, serving as a setup script for a machine learning model compression environment.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'model_compression_toolkit' modules and version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements executed at module load; no data flow or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard import statements and license header.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from a well-known package and a version string, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The license header and version string are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for importing modules of a legitimate open-source machine learning model compression toolkit. It poses no security risks or malicious threats based on the provided snippet and analysis.",
