{
  "purpose": "Import statements for a model compression toolkit, setting up various modules and functionalities related to model capabilities, logging, training, quantization, exporting, and data generation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'model_compression_toolkit' library modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or data leaks; no external network connections or data outputs are present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; imports are static and do not process untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a known library related to model compression. All imported modules are standard components of the toolkit, and there are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code execution. The presence of version info is typical for package metadata. No suspicious or anomalous code behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import setup for a model compression toolkit with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate package for machine learning model processing.",
