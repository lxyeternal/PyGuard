  "purpose": "Detects the presence of ML libraries (TensorFlow, Torch, torchvision, onnx, onnxruntime) and checks TensorFlow version for compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec() calls for each library, and tf.__version__ for TensorFlow version check",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external outputs; purely environment detection",
  "flows": "Library presence checks lead to internal flags; no data flows to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dependency detection logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment detection by checking for the presence of specific ML libraries and their versions. It uses safe module detection methods and includes a version check for TensorFlow to disable support for versions >= 2.16. There are no data leaks, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors. The logic is typical for setup scripts, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detection snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors. It performs standard dependency checks and version validation without any suspicious or malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
