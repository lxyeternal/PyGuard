{
  "purpose": "The code detects the presence of specific machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, Torch, ONNX) and checks the version of TensorFlow to determine support or compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads import specifications to detect whether certain libraries (tensorflow, torch, torchvision, onnx, onnxruntime) are available in the environment.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious actions; no output or data transmission functions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking for the existence of specific modules and then conditionally importing or setting flags based on library presence and version, with no data passing from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes version comparison logic for TensorFlow but does not perform any unusual or suspicious operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated or misleading code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment inspection by checking the availability and versions of certain ML libraries. It uses importlib.util.find_spec() for safe module detection and compares TensorFlow versions to determine compatibility. No user input, environment variables, or external data are processed in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The code's structure and purpose are straightforward, focusing solely on environment setup and compatibility checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign environment detection routine without any malicious intent. It does not contain malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It simply verifies the presence and version of libraries to support compatibility logic.",
