{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the presence of specific deep learning libraries (TensorFlow, Torch, ONNX) and their versions to determine compatibility or support within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Import statements and importlib.util.find_spec() calls to detect presence of external libraries.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only detects the presence and versions of libraries without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import detection flows, but no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward library detection and version checking.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and constants. It detects whether TensorFlow, Torch, ONNX, and ONNX Runtime are installed using importlib.util.find_spec(). For TensorFlow, it additionally checks the version and sets a flag accordingly. No malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The logic is standard for environment setup or dependency checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing environment checks for library presence and versions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are observed.",
