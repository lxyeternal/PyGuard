{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to check for the presence of specific machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX) and verify their versions or availability, likely for conditional import or compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads import specifications using importlib.util.find_spec for the modules 'tensorflow', 'torch', 'torchvision', 'onnx', and 'onnxruntime'. It also reads the version of tensorflow if found.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data flows to cause security issues. The code does not execute or process external inputs directly.",
  "flows": "The code checks for library presence, then conditionally imports 'tensorflow' and compares its version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, primarily performing library detection and version checks. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules necessary for import checking and version comparison. It checks whether TensorFlow is installed, and if so, whether its version is below 2.16 before importing it. It also checks for the presence of torch, torchvision, onnx, and onnxruntime libraries. All operations are standard and do not involve any execution of untrusted input or malicious behavior. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be compatibility or environment detection for further processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detection script for common ML libraries. It performs no malicious actions, does not leak data, and contains no suspicious or malicious code. It is safe and aligned with typical dependency detection logic.",
