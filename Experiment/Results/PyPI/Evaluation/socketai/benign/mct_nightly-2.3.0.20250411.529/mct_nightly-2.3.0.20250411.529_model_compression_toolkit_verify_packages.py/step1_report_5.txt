{
  "purpose": "To conditionally import deep learning frameworks based on their availability and version compatibility for model compression tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads package specifications to check for the presence of 'tensorflow', 'torch', 'torchvision', 'onnx', and 'onnxruntime'. It also reads the version of TensorFlow if present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data leakage could occur. No untrusted input is handled or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking the presence of specific packages, then conditionally importing them or setting flags based on version constraints.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected. The code uses standard library functions for package detection and version comparison. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules for dynamic import checks and version parsing. It then checks for the presence of the TensorFlow package using importlib.util.find_spec, setting a flag accordingly. If TensorFlow is found, it attempts to import it and verify that its version is below 2.16; if not, it resets the flag. Similar checks are performed for torch, torchvision, onnx, and onnxruntime packages. All operations are standard for dependency detection and version compatibility handling. There are no external inputs, outputs, or suspicious logic involved. No malware or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate dependency checks for a deep learning model compression toolkit. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, and no security risks are evident. It appears to be a straightforward setup script for package detection with version handling.",
