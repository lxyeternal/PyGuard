{
  "purpose": "To conditionally import machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Torch, ONNX) based on their availability and version constraints.",
  "sources": "Import statements and package version checks.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import and version checking flow to determine framework availability.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward conditional imports and version logic.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of specific ML frameworks (TensorFlow, Torch, ONNX) using importlib, then imports TensorFlow only if available and its version is below 2.16. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The logic appears standard for environment detection. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical environment setup snippet for ML frameworks, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign configuration code with no malicious intent.",
