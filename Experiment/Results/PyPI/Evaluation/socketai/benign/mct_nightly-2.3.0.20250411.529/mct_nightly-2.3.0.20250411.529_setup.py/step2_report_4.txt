  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the script as a standard Python setup configuration.\n- No reports mention any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The code reads local files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.md') and processes command-line arguments using standard libraries.\n- No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The use of open() and argparse is typical for setup scripts.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code reads files with open() without exception handling, which could be a minor concern if files are missing or corrupted, but this is standard practice in setup scripts and not malicious.\n- The manipulation of sys.argv in `get_release_arguments()` is a common pattern to handle unknown command-line args; no malicious intent is implied.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1.0\n- These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is also correct.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security issues or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm that the overall assessment is that this code is safe and benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The code is a standard, legitimate setup script for a Python package.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
