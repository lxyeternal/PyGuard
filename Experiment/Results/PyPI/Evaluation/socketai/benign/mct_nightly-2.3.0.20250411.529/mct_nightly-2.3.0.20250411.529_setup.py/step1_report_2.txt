{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'mct-nightly' with specific dependencies and package information, facilitating distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt' to obtain dependencies, reads from 'README.md' for long description, processes command-line arguments via argparse, and accesses sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data is sent over networks, written to external files, or used in unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' flows into package setup parameters; command-line arguments are processed but not used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'print' statements in utility functions is benign; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code adheres to standard setup script practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures, including reading dependencies and description files, parsing command-line arguments, and configuring package metadata. It utilizes open files and standard libraries without any suspicious behavior. No data leakage, malicious commands, or unusual code patterns are present. The functions are straightforward, and the overall structure aligns with typical Python setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate for package distribution.",
