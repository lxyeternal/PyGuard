{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for configuring and packaging a Python project, reading dependencies and description from local files, and handling command-line arguments for setup options.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reads 'README.md' for long description, and processes command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data, connect to external servers, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and parses command-line arguments; no external data flow or untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior; standard use of open() and argparse without exception handling is typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading dependencies, description, and handling arguments. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or contain hardcoded secrets. All operations are typical for a Python package setup file, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
