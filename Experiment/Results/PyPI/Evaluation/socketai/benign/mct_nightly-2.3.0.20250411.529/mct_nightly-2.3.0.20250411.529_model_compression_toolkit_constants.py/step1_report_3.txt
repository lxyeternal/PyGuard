{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning model compression and quantization framework, primarily focused on deep learning models with support for TensorFlow and PyTorch.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from constant definitions and configuration parameters set within the script, including environment variables or external configuration files are not explicitly referenced.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data output, network communication, or external system interaction beyond setting constants and parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows, user input handling, or untrusted data processing present in the code; it purely sets static constants and configuration attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are observed. All variables are straightforward configuration parameters related to quantization, resource estimation, or model structure. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and configuration parameters for a machine learning model compression and quantization library. No code execution, input processing, or data handling is present. It avoids dynamic execution or obfuscation, and there are no indicators of malicious intent. The constants pertain to model quantization, resource calculations, and scheduling, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of configuration constants for a deep learning model compression framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign setup script for model quantization and resource estimation purposes.",
