  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature:**\n   - The code is a collection of static constant definitions, configuration parameters, attribute names, and framework identifiers.\n   - It does not include functions, data processing, external data sources, or runtime logic.\n   - It is clearly intended as a configuration or constants module for a neural network quantization and optimization framework.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n   - No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or embedded payloads are detected.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a foundation for other modules.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to external systems.\n   - There are no signs of data leaks, injection points, or malicious logic.\n   - All constants and attribute names are standard for model quantization and resource estimation.\n\n4. **Scores & Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or payloads detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present; code is straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — Given the above, the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, purely declarative, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the static and straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No report suggests any anomalies or signs of compromise.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely constants and configuration, it cannot execute malicious actions on its own.\n   - Any security concerns would stem from how this code is used elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, there are no issues.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (consistent with all reports)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**My personal estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is a benign, static configuration module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, non-malicious, and suitable for inclusion in a supply chain without concern for security risks.",
