{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, configuration parameters, and attribute names for a neural network quantization and optimization framework, serving as static configuration data.",
  "sources": "Static constant definitions, attribute name strings, framework identifiers, and configuration parameters; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code contains straightforward static constants with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants and configuration parameters used in model quantization and resource estimation. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to serve as a configuration module, and it does not interact with external data or perform any runtime actions. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code. The malware scores are appropriately zero; the risk scores are also zero, except for a slightly inflated value in one report which is inconsistent with the static nature. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with its content. No modifications are necessary.",
