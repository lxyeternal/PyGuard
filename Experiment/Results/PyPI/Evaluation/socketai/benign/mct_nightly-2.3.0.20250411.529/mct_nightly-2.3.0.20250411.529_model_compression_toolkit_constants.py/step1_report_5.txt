{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning model compression or quantization framework, possibly for use with neural network optimization.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading points are present; the code contains only variable definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks are present; the code does not include functions or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code solely defines static configuration parameters without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative with no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of constants and parameters relevant to quantization, resource estimation, and scheduling for neural network models. It includes settings for different quantization schemes, iteration counts, thresholds, and memory constants. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions that could indicate malicious intent. The content appears standard for a machine learning framework configuration, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module defining constants for a neural network quantization framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
