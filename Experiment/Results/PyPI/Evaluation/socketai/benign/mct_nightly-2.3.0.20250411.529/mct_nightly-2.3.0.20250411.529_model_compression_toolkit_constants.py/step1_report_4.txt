{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning model quantization and optimization framework, specifically related to TensorFlow and PyTorch models.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or external data; it only defines static configuration variables and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no functions, data writes, or output operations present that could serve as sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the code consists solely of constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No suspicious code patterns, dynamic execution, or embedded payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static configuration constants used in a model quantization and resource estimation framework. It includes framework identifiers, quantization parameters, iteration counts for search algorithms, and other configuration constants. There are no functions, I/O operations, or data manipulations that could indicate malicious activity. The code's content and structure are consistent with legitimate configuration files used in machine learning pipelines. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration/constants module used for model quantization and optimization processes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be standard for its purpose, with no suspicious elements.",
