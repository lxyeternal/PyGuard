{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, configuration parameters, and attribute names used for model quantization, resource utilization, and scheduling in a neural network model optimization framework, likely related to model compression or acceleration.",
  "sources": "Definitions of constants, attribute names, and configuration parameters, primarily static data without dynamic input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or output; the code mainly sets constants and attributes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from external sources to sinks; the code contains no data processing or input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code is purely declarative, defining configuration values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of static constant definitions and configuration parameters for a model quantization and optimization framework. It includes framework identifiers, quantization settings, iteration parameters, and various attribute keys. There are no dynamic or external data sources, no data transformations, and no suspicious operations. The absence of input/output handling, external data processing, or code execution points indicates it is a straightforward configuration script. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior are detected. The code appears to serve as a foundation for other modules that perform actual computation or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and constant declaration script without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is purely declarative and does not perform any runtime actions that could harm or compromise systems.",
