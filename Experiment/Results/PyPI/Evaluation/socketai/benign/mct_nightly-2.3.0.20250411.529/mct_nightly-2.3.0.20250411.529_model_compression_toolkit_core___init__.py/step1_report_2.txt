{
  "purpose": "Importing various modules related to model compression, quantization, and resource utilization for framework-specific tools.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from external modules in the 'model_compression_toolkit' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures. The code appears to be standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for modules related to model compression, quantization, and resource utilization across different frameworks (Keras, PyTorch). It includes no executable logic, user input handling, or external data processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed. The imports are typical for a model optimization toolkit.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of import statements from a well-defined open-source package, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is likely part of a larger project aimed at model compression and quantization.",
