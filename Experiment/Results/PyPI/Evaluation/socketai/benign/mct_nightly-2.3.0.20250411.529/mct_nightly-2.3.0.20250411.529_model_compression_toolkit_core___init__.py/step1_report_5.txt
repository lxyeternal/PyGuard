{
  "purpose": "Importing modules and classes related to model compression, quantization, and resource utilization for deep learning frameworks (Keras and PyTorch).",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes; no data input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sink identified; no untrusted data or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various modules related to model quantization and resource utilization. There are no data inputs, network operations, or code execution features that could be exploited. All imported modules seem to be standard components of a model compression toolkit. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import section of a model compression toolkit, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger framework.",
