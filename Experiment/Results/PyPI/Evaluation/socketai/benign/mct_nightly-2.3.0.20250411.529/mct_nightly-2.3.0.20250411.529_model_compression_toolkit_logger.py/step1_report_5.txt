{
  "purpose": "The code provides a logging utility class and functions to manage logging configurations such as setting log levels, log file paths, and shutdown procedures.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (LOG_PATH), system time (datetime.now()), and input parameters (log_folder, log_level).",
  "sinks": "The code writes log data to files specified by constructed paths, including logs and error messages.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or input parameters determine log folder paths, which are used to create directories and log files. Log messages are generated and saved to these files, with some functions raising exceptions on critical logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code employs standard logging practices, and all data handling appears normal and expected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Logger class for managing application logging, including setting levels, creating log directories, and handling log files. It utilizes environment variables for flexible log path configuration and includes methods to shutdown logging properly. All operations are typical for logging utilities and do not involve any suspicious or malicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious sinks are detected. The use of raising exceptions on critical logs is standard for error handling. Overall, the implementation appears safe and legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard logging utility module with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is designed to facilitate logging in applications and does not perform any harmful or unauthorized actions.",
