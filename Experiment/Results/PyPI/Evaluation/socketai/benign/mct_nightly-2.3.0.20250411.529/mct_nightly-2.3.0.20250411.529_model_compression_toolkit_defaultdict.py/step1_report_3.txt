  "purpose": "Implement a simple wrapper around a dictionary that provides default values for missing keys.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources; the code operates on provided arguments and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: storing a dictionary and returning values or keys; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The class DefaultDict is a basic wrapper for a dictionary with default value handling. It initializes with an optional dictionary and default value, and provides methods to retrieve values and keys. The get() method returns the value associated with a key or a deepcopy of the default value if the key is missing. No external input, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be standard utility code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for dictionary management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this snippet.",
