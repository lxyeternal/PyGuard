{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a default dictionary wrapper that returns a default value for missing keys.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters 'known_dict' and 'default_value'; method 'get' which retrieves values based on keys.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or sent over networks, and no sensitive data is handled insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys) come from method arguments; retrieval from 'known_dict' or returning 'default_value'. No external data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code functions as a simple dictionary wrapper without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a custom dictionary with default return values. It initializes with optional known dictionary and default value. The 'get' method returns the associated value or a deepcopy of the default value if key is missing. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or external inputs that could be malicious are present. The implementation appears safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility class for dictionary management, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any suspicious activities or data leaks.",
