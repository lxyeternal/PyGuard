  "purpose": "A simple dictionary wrapper that provides default values for missing keys, ensuring safe retrieval without exposing vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data via the 'get' method for keys; internal 'known_dict' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Return of default_value via deepcopy; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input key to 'get' method, which retrieves from 'known_dict' or returns a deepcopy of 'default_value'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility class that wraps a dictionary, providing default values for missing keys. It uses standard Python practices, including 'deepcopy' to prevent unintended mutations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not perform external data access, network communication, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The use of 'deepcopy' is safe and appropriate. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility class with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are consistent with its benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
