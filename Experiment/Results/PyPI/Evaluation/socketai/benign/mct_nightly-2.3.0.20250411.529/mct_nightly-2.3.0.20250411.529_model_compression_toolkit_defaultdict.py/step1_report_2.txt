  "purpose": "Implementation of a wrapper around a dictionary that provides default values for missing keys.",
  "sources": "Initialization of known_dict and default_value in __init__; access to dictionary keys via get() method.",
  "sinks": "The get() method retrieves data from known_dict or default_value; no external output or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Access to self.known_dict[key] flows from source (dictionary) to return; default_value used if key absent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The class appears straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a simple dictionary wrapper with default fallback behavior. It uses deepcopy to return default_value, preventing unintended mutations. There are no external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a default dictionary wrapper without malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
