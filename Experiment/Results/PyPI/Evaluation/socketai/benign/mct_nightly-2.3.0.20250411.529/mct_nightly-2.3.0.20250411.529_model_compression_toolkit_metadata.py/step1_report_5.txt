{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and return metadata for a model, including version information and scheduling details, for use in model compression and quantization workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from the FrameworkQuantizationCapabilities object, and scheduling details from the SchedulerInfo object.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects; the code does not perform data transmission or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Version information from 'fqc' flows into the metadata via get_versions_dict; scheduling information from 'scheduler_info' flows into the metadata via get_scheduler_metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. All data handling seems normal for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating model metadata, extracting version info, and gathering scheduling metadata. It utilizes dataclasses and type hints for clarity. No inputs are taken from untrusted sources beyond the provided objects, and no data is transmitted externally. It does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for a module that reports internal versioning and scheduling data. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden code execution, or malicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata generation module for model versioning and scheduling information. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears safe and legitimate within its intended functionality.",
