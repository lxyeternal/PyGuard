{
  "purpose": "The code generates metadata for a model, including version info and scheduling details, for use in model compression and deployment workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from imported modules and scheduler information from the SchedulerInfo object.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no external network or file I/O based on the provided code.",
  "flows": "Version info from fqc object flows into get_versions_dict; scheduler info flows from SchedulerInfo into get_scheduler_metadata to generate metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The imports and data processing appear standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines functions for creating and collecting metadata related to model versioning and scheduling. It includes safe data handling: importing version info, converting data classes to dicts, and processing scheduler info into nested dictionaries. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious data handling is present. The code depends on external modules and objects but does not contain any evident malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard utility module for metadata generation, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It operates on known data structures and performs straightforward data extraction and formatting. No malware signals or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
