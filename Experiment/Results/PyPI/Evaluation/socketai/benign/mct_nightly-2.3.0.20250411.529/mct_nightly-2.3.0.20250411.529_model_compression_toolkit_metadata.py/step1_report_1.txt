{
  "purpose": "The code generates metadata for a model, including version information and scheduling details, primarily for model compression and quantization workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads version attributes from the FrameworkQuantizationCapabilities object, and extracts scheduling information from the SchedulerInfo object, including operator scheduling, cuts, and fused nodes mapping.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations such as network communication, file access, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Version info from fqc is used to create metadata, which may include scheduling details from scheduler_info; however, data flows are internal and limited to object attributes and function return values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated sections are present. All code appears to be standard data extraction and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs metadata dictionaries for model versioning and scheduling, utilizing data classes and type annotations. Version info is obtained from the FrameworkQuantizationCapabilities object, and scheduling data from SchedulerInfo. The code only reads attributes and creates formatted dictionaries, with no network, file, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected. All operations are benign data formatting for model metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for collecting and formatting model and scheduling metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is standard, well-structured, and appears safe.",
