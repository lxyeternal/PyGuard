{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions for creating metadata about a model, including version information and scheduling details, for use in model compression and target platform capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (model_compression_toolkit and its submodules), and attributes of input objects such as FrameworkQuantizationCapabilities and SchedulerInfo.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file system, or environment variable operations; no data leaks or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects (fqc and scheduling_info) through functions to assemble metadata dictionaries, with no untrusted data manipulation or external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs; code appears standard and well-structured; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation for metadata creation, involving data class usage, version retrieval, and structured extraction of scheduling info. It avoids unsafe operations, external side effects, or hidden behavior. The functions seem solely focused on data organization and reporting, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe, intended for generating metadata about a model's version and scheduling details. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears standard, well-documented, and free of suspicious patterns.",
