{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate metadata for a model, including version information and scheduling details, for use in model compression and deployment workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from imported modules, scheduling info from function arguments, and attributes from complex objects like SchedulerInfo.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code primarily processes and returns data structures without untrusted data outputs or external communication.",
  "flows": "Version info is fetched from imported modules and object attributes, then assembled into dictionaries; scheduling info is extracted from a SchedulerInfo object and formatted into nested dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution detected. Usage of internal package attributes and data class conversions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and constructs metadata dictionaries in a straightforward manner, including optional scheduling data. It uses safe data handling practices and standard Python features. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only noteworthy aspect is the import within a function to avoid circular dependencies, which is a common practice and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears legitimate and safe, focused on metadata creation for a model compression toolkit. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this review.",
