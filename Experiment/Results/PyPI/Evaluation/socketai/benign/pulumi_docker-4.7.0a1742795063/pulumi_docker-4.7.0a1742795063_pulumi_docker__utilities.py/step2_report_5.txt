  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions, version handling, resource registration, environment variable access, and lazy import mechanisms. No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected. It uses standard library functions and appears to be auto-generated SDK code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to dynamic imports)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malicious activity, and the dynamic import functions are standard in SDKs, with no evidence of exploitation. The low security risk is justified given the dynamic import capability, but no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on utility functions, dynamic imports, and resource registration. No malicious behavior observed. Dynamic imports could be exploited if module names are manipulated, but no such evidence here.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1. The code is standard, and dynamic import functions are controlled. No malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions, dynamic import via lazy_import, resource registration, version handling. No signs of malicious activity. The dynamic import could be risky if module names are untrusted, but no such exploitation is evident.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above. The code is typical infrastructure code with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, dynamic module importation, resource registration, version parsing. No signs of malicious activity. Dynamic imports could be exploited if module names are externally controlled, but the code seems controlled.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, version handling, resource registration, decorators. No signs of malicious activity. No network or data exfiltration observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The code is standard infrastructure utility code with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and given the code's nature—utility functions, dynamic imports, resource registration—there's no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and generated, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are uniformly low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the use of dynamic imports and JSON inputs, which could pose risks if misused, but in this context, they are controlled and standard.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to dynamic import potential but no actual exploitation or malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated Pulumi utility module. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. The dynamic import functions are typical for SDKs and are not exploited here.\n\n**Recommendation:** Maintain awareness of dynamic import risks if module names are influenced by untrusted sources, but in this case, the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further analysis or specific focus on any part.",
