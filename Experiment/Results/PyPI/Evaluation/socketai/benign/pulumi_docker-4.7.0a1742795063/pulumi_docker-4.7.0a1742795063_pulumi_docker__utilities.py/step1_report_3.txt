{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions, version handling, dynamic importing, resource registration, and wrapper decorators for Pulumi infrastructure as code operations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via get_env, importlib.metadata for version info, and JSON data input for resource modules and packages.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data passed into resource registration, dynamic import results, or environment variables, which could influence resource creation or configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → get_env functions; JSON data → register function → resource registration; dynamic import → resource construction; decorators wrapping functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports via lazy_import and importlib.util.LazyLoader; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code; no direct network or file system access; version handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is mainly utility and registration code for Pulumi packages and modules, involving environment variable access, dynamic import mechanisms, version parsing, and resource registration. The use of dynamic imports with importlib.util.LazyLoader can be exploited if malicious modules are injected or manipulated, but no direct malicious actions (like network access, data exfiltration, or file modification) are present in this code. The code handles version info securely and does not handle sensitive data directly. No backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic were found. Its purpose is to facilitate resource registration and version management in Pulumi-based infrastructure code, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is utility and infrastructure management code for Pulumi, with dynamic import capabilities that could pose risks if malicious modules are introduced. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior in its current form. It appears to be a standard, well-structured helper library for Pulumi resource management.",
