{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a utility module for Pulumi infrastructure as code framework, providing functions for environment variable access, version handling, resource and module registration, and utility decorators for Pulumi SDK extensions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via get_env and related functions), importlib.metadata for version info, json input for resource/module registration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to leaks or malicious effects are present. No network or file system operations suggest malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variable reads to configuration functions, version info retrieval to internal version management, resource/module registration from JSON input, and decorated functions for Pulumi output handling.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains warnings about generated files and standard utility functions. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code flows. Usage of importlib for lazy loading is standard. No obfuscated or malicious-looking code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script provides utility functions for environment variable access, version management, resource registration, and function decoration within Pulumi's SDK context. The version parsing converts PEP440 to semver, which is standard. Resource registration uses JSON input and dynamic imports but no malicious patterns are observed. No network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be standard infrastructure management utilities, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for Pulumi infrastructure management, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It mainly facilitates version management, dynamic loading, and resource registration. No security risks or malicious activities are identified.",
