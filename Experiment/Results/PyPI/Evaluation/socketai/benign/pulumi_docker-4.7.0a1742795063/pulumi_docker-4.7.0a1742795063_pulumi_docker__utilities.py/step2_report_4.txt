  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions, version handling, resource registration, and dynamic import mechanisms. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code appears straightforward and auto-generated, not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minor concern about dynamic imports if untrusted JSON is used, but overall low.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The dynamic import functions could be exploited if malicious JSON inputs are provided, but this is a typical pattern in SDKs. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with emphasis on dynamic module loading via lazy_import. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, auto-generated.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — same concern about dynamic imports if external input influences module names, but no evidence of exploitation.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies potential risks with dynamic imports but notes no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, dynamic import via importlib.util.LazyLoader, resource registration, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — dynamic import mechanisms could be risky if module names are externally controlled, but no evidence of such exploitation.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; dynamic imports are standard but can be risky if misused.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on resource registration, dynamic import, and version handling. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — potential risk with dynamic import if module names are manipulated, but no indication this occurs.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the potential concern but finds no actual malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for environment variables, version, resource registration; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low; standard utility code.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature. No signs of malicious activity are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All 0, consistent with the clear, auto-generated code.\n- **Security Risks:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 or 0.1, mainly due to dynamic import mechanisms, which are common in SDKs but could be risky if inputs are untrusted. However, no actual exploitation or malicious activity is observed.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard utility module for Pulumi, with dynamic imports, version parsing, and resource registration functions.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- Dynamic import functions could pose a risk if external inputs influence module names, but this is a known pattern in SDKs and is not inherently malicious.\n- The environment variable accessors and version handling are typical and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minimal, related to dynamic import potential, but no actual issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and align with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
