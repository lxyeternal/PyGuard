  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment variable access, version parsing, resource registration, dynamic module import, and resource construction within Pulumi SDK.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.getenv; importlib.metadata for version info; dynamic imports via importlib.util.find_spec and LazyLoader; JSON inputs for resource modules and packages.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic import paths; JSON inputs for resource registration; environment variables; resource construction functions.",
  "flows": "get_env functions read environment variables; _get_semver_version uses importlib.metadata; lazy_import loads modules dynamically; register registers resource packages and modules; resource construction uses lazy_import to instantiate classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import functions which could be manipulated if module names are externally controlled; JSON inputs for resource registration could be untrusted; no explicit validation or sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated Pulumi utility module. It employs environment variable access, version parsing, dynamic module loading, and resource registration. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import functions could pose a risk if module names are influenced by untrusted sources, but in typical SDK usage, these are controlled. The version handling and resource registration follow standard patterns. The overall structure and logic are straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated Pulumi SDK utility module with no malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects the potential but unlikely exploitation of dynamic imports if module names are manipulated externally. All evidence indicates the code is safe and free from malware or obfuscation.",
