  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions, resource registration, and version handling for Pulumi infrastructure as code, along with some environment variable accessors and lazy import mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (get_env, get_env_bool, get_env_int, get_env_float), importlib.metadata for package version, sys.modules for lazy imports, JSON inputs for resource registration.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flow from environment variables, JSON inputs, and lazy imported modules into resource construction and configuration functions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (input) -> get_env functions -> resource options/functions; JSON inputs (resource_modules, resource_packages) -> registration functions -> resource package/module construction; Lazy import mechanisms -> dynamic class/resource instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Use of eval or exec is absent. Lazy import system appears standard; no malicious intent detected. Version handling involves parsing package metadata, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly provides utility functions for environment variable access, version parsing, resource registration, and dynamic module loading. No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The lazy import system dynamically loads modules but relies on standard library functions without malicious modification. The resource construction relies on JSON input to determine modules and classes, which could be exploited if untrusted JSON is provided; however, such data flow is expected in deployment scenarios. No suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious system access, are detected. The functions seem to serve legitimate purposes aligned with Pulumi's infrastructure management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for Pulumi resource management, with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles versioning, dynamic imports, and resource registration securely within expected patterns. Risks could arise if untrusted JSON inputs are used without validation, but that is outside the scope of this code. Overall, the code appears safe and unmalicious.",
