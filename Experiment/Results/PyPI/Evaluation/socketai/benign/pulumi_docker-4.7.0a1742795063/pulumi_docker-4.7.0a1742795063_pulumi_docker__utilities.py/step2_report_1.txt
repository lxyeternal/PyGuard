  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for Pulumi, handling environment variables, version parsing, resource registration, and dynamic imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minor, likely due to dynamic imports and JSON input handling, which could be exploited if untrusted data is used maliciously.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only concern is potential misuse if untrusted JSON or environment variables are maliciously crafted, but this is typical in such SDKs.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dynamic imports and resource registration. No malicious behavior observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — same as above, due to dynamic module loading.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; dynamic imports are standard but could be risky if external inputs are malicious. No evidence of backdoors or malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on utility functions and dynamic imports, with similar conclusions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning applies; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with dynamic importation, version handling, and resource registration. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic import functions could pose a risk if module names are externally manipulated, but no such exploitation is evident here.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions for Pulumi, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — slightly lower, reflecting the generally safe nature but acknowledging the potential risk of dynamic imports if misused.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, code is clear and auto-generated.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2), justified by the use of dynamic imports and untrusted JSON inputs, which could be exploited if misused. However, no evidence of actual exploitation or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n- The low security risk scores reflect awareness of potential misuse but no actual malicious activity.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — considering the dynamic import mechanisms and untrusted JSON inputs, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but no evidence of such exploitation here.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard Pulumi utility module with no malicious intent. The minor security concern relates to dynamic imports and JSON inputs, but within this context, it is acceptable and typical for such SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that any JSON inputs or environment variables used in production are validated and sanitized to mitigate potential exploitation of dynamic import functions.",
