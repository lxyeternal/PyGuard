{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the Pulumi Docker SDK module, importing various resource classes and setting up resource registration and configuration loading.",
  "sources": "Conditional import of 'pulumi_docker.config' via _utilities.lazy_import, static imports of resource classes, embedded JSON strings for resource registration.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no network activity or data leaks; resource registration occurs locally.",
  "flows": "The lazy_import function loads configuration data; registration strings are static; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic lazy import for configuration, embedded JSON registration strings, auto-generated comments, and standard module imports; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated SDK setup module for Pulumi's Docker provider. It performs resource class imports, conditionally loads configuration via a safe utility function, and registers resource modules and packages with static JSON data. No network activity, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The use of lazy_import is typical for optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. The embedded JSON strings are static and benign. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for SDK initialization, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated SDK setup code with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are consistent with this assessment: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting cautious recognition of dynamic import patterns but overall very low risk.",
