{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated module for Pulumi's Docker provider, importing various submodules and registering resource modules and packages related to Docker resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (. utilities, submodules like _enums, container, get_logs, etc.), environment detection for conditional import of 'pulumi_docker.config'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the lazy import of 'pulumi_docker.config' which could load external configurations, but no other untrusted data handling or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from conditional import to lazy loading configuration, and from module imports to registration functions, with no external untrusted data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a warning comment about automatic code generation, and it dynamically imports configuration only if not in type checking mode. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic is observed. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated module for Pulumi's Docker provider. It imports several submodules and registers resource modules and packages via utility functions. The environment check for type checking and lazy import of configuration is typical for avoiding import-time side effects. The presence of a warning comment suggests caution but does not indicate malicious intent. No unusual or malicious code patterns, external network calls, or data leaks are found. The overall structure is consistent with a typical SDK module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, auto-generated SDK module for Pulumi Docker resources. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are identified. It serves as a setup and registration script for Pulumi's Docker resource management.",
