{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an autogenerated module for Pulumi's Docker provider, designed to import and register various Docker resource classes and modules for infrastructure as code management.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_utilities, typing), and the lazy import of 'pulumi_docker.config'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the lazy import 'pulumi_docker.config' which could be misused if the imported module contains malicious code or data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, registering resource modules and packages, and conditionally importing configuration based on typing.TYPE_CHECKING. The data flows from the imports into internal registration functions.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the file is generated by a tool (Pulumi Terraform Bridge), which is common and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The only dynamic behavior is the lazy import of 'pulumi_docker.config', which is standard but could be misused if that module were malicious, though that is external to this code.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a boilerplate for module registration and resource class exportation for Pulumi's Docker provider. It uses standard Python patterns for conditional imports and registration functions. The only dynamic behavior involves the lazy import of 'pulumi_docker.config', which is typical for optional configurations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious operations are evident. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, system modifications, or backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical autogenerated module for Pulumi's Docker provider, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs standard registration and import operations for resource classes, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
