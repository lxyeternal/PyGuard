{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource classes and input types for managing Docker plugins within a Pulumi infrastructure as code setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from class initializers, property setters, and method arguments; it also imports external Pulumi modules and custom utility modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is used directly in resource properties without validation. No explicit sinks for malicious actions are present, but resource properties could influence system state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from initializers and property setters flow into resource property definitions; the get methods retrieve Pulumi outputs which are used for infrastructure provisioning.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an internal bug note indicating 'Type and Name are switched' in the constructor docstrings, but this is a comment, not an active bug. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code appears to be a standard resource class implementation with no obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource class implementation, defining input and output types for managing Docker plugins. It uses typical patterns for resource creation, property getters/setters, and resource lookup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The only noted anomaly is a comment about a known bug in the constructor documentation, which does not impact execution. The imports are standard, and no dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource class for Docker plugins, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as infrastructure management code with standard patterns and no suspicious behaviors.",
