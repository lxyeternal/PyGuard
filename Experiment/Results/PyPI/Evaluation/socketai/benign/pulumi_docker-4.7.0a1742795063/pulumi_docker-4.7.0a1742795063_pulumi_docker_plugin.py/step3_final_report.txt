{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes for managing Docker plugins, reading configuration data from input parameters and class properties. It is auto-generated SDK code for infrastructure management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided during resource instantiation, class property getters.",
  "sinks": "Resource properties assigned from user inputs; no external communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into resource class properties without external or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "A comment indicating a bug ('Type and Name are switched') but no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated Pulumi SDK module for Docker plugin management. It contains resource argument and state classes, with property accessors. No network calls, command executions, or data leaks are present. The reliance on user input is typical for IaC SDKs and does not constitute malicious behavior. The comment about a bug is a non-security-related note. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK code with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1–0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
