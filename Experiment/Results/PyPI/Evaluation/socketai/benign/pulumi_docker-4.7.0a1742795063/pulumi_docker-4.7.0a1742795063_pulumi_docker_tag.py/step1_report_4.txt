{
  "purpose": "Define and manage Docker image tagging resources using Pulumi infrastructure as code framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as source_image, target_image, source_image_id from function arguments and resource properties.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input data passed to resource properties, which could influence resource creation or identification.",
  "flows": "Input data (sources) flow into resource property assignments; these properties are then used to create or retrieve resources, but there are no indications of data being transmitted externally or manipulated maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; code primarily consists of resource property management and input validation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for resource input types and a resource class for Docker tagging, with typical property getters/setters and resource initialization logic. It includes standard validation for required properties and merges resource options with defaults. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious logic detected. It appears to be a standard resource management implementation using Pulumi SDK, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi resource definition for Docker image tagging, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for infrastructure management, with appropriate input handling and resource creation logic.",
