  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource classes for Docker image tagging, handling resource properties and creation logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for source_image, target_image, source_image_id, and resource property getters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource property assignments; no external data flow or malicious payloads detected.",
  "anomalies": "Auto-generated comment, standard resource pattern, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pulumi resource class for Docker tagging, auto-generated, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. It manages resource properties with standard validation and property accessors. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The resource interacts solely with resource properties and internal Pulumi mechanisms, consistent with typical infrastructure as code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi resource for Docker image tagging, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.0-0.1). It poses no supply chain security threat.",
