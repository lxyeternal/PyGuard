{
  "purpose": "Define a Pulumi resource for managing Docker image tags, enabling tagging operations similar to 'docker tag' command.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for resource creation, particularly 'source_image', 'target_image', and optional 'source_image_id' (from user inputs and resource properties).",
  "sinks": "Resource initialization and property accessors that may handle or expose sensitive or untrusted data, but primarily for resource configuration.",
  "flows": "Input data (from user or other resources) flows into resource properties during initialization; properties are retrieved via getters for output use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no obfuscated code patterns; no suspicious network activity or file operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Pulumi input types and a custom resource class for managing Docker tags. It includes property setters and getters, resource initialization with validation, and a static 'get' method for resource lookup. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or external data exfiltration. The code performs standard resource management functions with proper parameter validation and type checking. No suspicious patterns, hidden code, or external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi resource implementation for Docker tagging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for infrastructure management without exposing sensitive data or executing harmful operations.",
