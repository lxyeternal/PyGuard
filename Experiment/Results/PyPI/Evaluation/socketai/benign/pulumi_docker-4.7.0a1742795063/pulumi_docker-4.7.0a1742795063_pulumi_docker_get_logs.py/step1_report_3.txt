{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes for retrieving Docker container logs via Pulumi automation, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage. It is intended for infrastructure as code automation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from function arguments such as details, discard_headers, follow, name, etc., and retrieves data via Pulumi's invoke functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is fetched from Pulumi runtime invoke calls; no untrusted data is written or sent to external systems. No code writes data to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into invoke calls, and the responses from Pulumi's runtime are mapped back into class instances, with no further processing or external data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a warning comment indicating it was auto-generated by a Pulumi Terraform Bridge tool. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of Pulumi's SDK is standard for infrastructure code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for handling logs, with input validation to ensure correct types. It performs Pulumi runtime invoke calls to retrieve Docker logs, and provides both synchronous and output-based asynchronous functions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or external data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Pulumi-based infrastructure script for fetching Docker container logs. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The code appears legitimate and safe for use.",
