{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Pulumi-based interface for retrieving logs from Docker containers, including classes for log result data and functions to invoke log retrieval operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in get_logs and get_logs_output functions, class constructor arguments, and environment variables possibly used internally by Pulumi.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data exposure through returned log contents, IDs, or configuration details; also, the invoke calls could send data to external Pulumi services.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → Function call → Pulumi invoke → External Pulumi service → Response data → Data wrapped in classes or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code includes a warning comment about being auto-generated. No suspicious external connections or data exfiltration behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be an auto-generated Pulumi resource wrapper for Docker log retrieval. It performs type checks on inputs, calls Pulumi runtime functions to fetch logs, and encapsulates results in defined classes. No malicious logic, data leaks, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code relies on Pulumi's infrastructure for secure communication. The comments warn against manual edits, indicating it’s a generated and standard resource wrapper. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi interface for Docker log retrieval. It performs no malicious actions, contains no suspicious behaviors, and appears to be safe for use. No security risks are identified beyond standard logging access which is expected in such contexts.",
