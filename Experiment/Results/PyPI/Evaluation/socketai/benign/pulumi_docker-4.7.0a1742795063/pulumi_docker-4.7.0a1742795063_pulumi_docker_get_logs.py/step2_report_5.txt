  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is auto-generated Pulumi SDK code for Docker logs. It performs input validation, invokes remote procedures, and processes responses without any suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — standard infrastructure code, no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code; no issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard Pulumi code for Docker logs, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, likely due to auto-generated nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical Pulumi wrapper for Docker logs, with proper input validation and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, typical for auto-generated code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—auto-generated Pulumi code, standard usage, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; code is an auto-generated Pulumi resource wrapper with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate. The code is standard SDK wrapper code, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, matching the code's clarity and auto-generated nature.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, generally 0 or 0.1-0.2, consistent with the code's function and context.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, auto-generated SDK code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — standard, well-structured, no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and align with the code's nature. No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for Docker logs. It performs input validation, remote procedure calls, and response handling in a typical manner. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
