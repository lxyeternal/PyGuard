{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions and classes for retrieving Docker container logs via Pulumi's infrastructure as code framework.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input parameters to functions (`get_logs`, `get_logs_output`) and class constructors; the code reads user-supplied parameters for log retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the `pulumi.runtime.invoke` and `pulumi.runtime.invoke_output` calls, which execute remote procedures, and the dynamic application of responses to `GetLogsResult` objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into `invoke`/`invoke_output` calls; responses from these calls are processed and mapped into data classes (`GetLogsResult`).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. The code includes a warning comment indicating it was generated automatically by a Pulumi tool. There is no obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious file operations. Usage of Pulumi's invoke functions is standard for infrastructure as code and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi provider wrapper for Docker logs, involving data validation, type annotations, and remote procedure calls. The initial comment explicitly states it is auto-generated by a Pulumi Terraform bridge tool, which suggests routine infrastructure code generation. The functions handle input validation, invoke remote procedures, and process responses without performing any unsafe or suspicious operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. No sensitive data handling, credential management, or network connections outside Pulumi's invoke framework are present. The overall structure appears legitimate and aligned with Pulumi's typical SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for Docker log retrieval. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical infrastructure code module with no suspicious activities or security issues.",
