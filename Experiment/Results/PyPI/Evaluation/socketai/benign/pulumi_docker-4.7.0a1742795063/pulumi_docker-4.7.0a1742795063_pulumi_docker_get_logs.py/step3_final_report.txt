  "purpose": "Auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for retrieving Docker container logs, performing input validation and invoking Pulumi runtime functions.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'details', 'discard_headers', 'follow', 'name', 'show_stderr', 'show_stdout', 'since', 'tail', 'timestamps', 'until' which read input data for log retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Pulumi's invoke functions and response mappings; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Pulumi's invoke calls; responses are mapped into data classes; no external data flows or network activity are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected; code is standard SDK boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for Docker logs. It validates input types, calls Pulumi's runtime invoke functions, and maps responses into structured data classes. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by the nature of log access but do not indicate actual security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate infrastructure-as-code SDK code with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments provided are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
