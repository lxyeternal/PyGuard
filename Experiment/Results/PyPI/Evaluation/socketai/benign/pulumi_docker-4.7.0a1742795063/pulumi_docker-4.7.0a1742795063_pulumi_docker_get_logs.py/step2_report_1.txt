  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine appropriate scores based on the code content.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is a set of auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrappers for Docker log retrieval.\n- It performs input validation, invokes Pulumi runtime functions, and returns structured results.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present.\n- The code is typical of infrastructure-as-code SDKs, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAccurately describes the code as auto-generated Pulumi wrapper for Docker logs. No malicious behavior or suspicious code detected. The code performs input validation, remote invocation, and data wrapping, all standard.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated) — justified.  \n- Security risk: 0 (no security issues) — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report's assessment aligns well with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nSimilarly, correctly identifies the code as Pulumi provider code for Docker logs, with standard patterns. No suspicious activity or malware.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Security risk: 0.1 — minimal, likely due to the potential exposure of logs or API calls, but no actual risk is evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report's scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAgain, the code is a typical Pulumi wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity. It handles input validation and Pulumi invoke calls.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Security risk: 0.1 — acceptable, given the context.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nMatches the pattern of a standard Pulumi SDK wrapper, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The report emphasizes the auto-generated nature and standard usage.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Security risk: 0.2 — still low, reflecting minimal potential exposure, but no actual risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nCorrectly describes the code as a Pulumi interface for Docker logs, with no malicious activity. It notes potential data exposure but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Security risk: 0.2 — consistent with the nature of log access but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, as the code is clear and auto-generated, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports, reflecting the potential exposure of logs, but no actual security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is standard, auto-generated Pulumi SDK code for Docker log retrieval.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present.\n- The risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0, given the absence of actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0**  |\n\nThis reflects the code's benign nature, its auto-generated status, and the lack of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is legitimate, safe, and typical of Pulumi SDK modules. No adjustments needed.",
