  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different Docker builder versions.",
  "sources": "Import of Enum from the enum module, and the class BuilderVersion with string constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output, no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code simply defines constants and an enumeration; no data flow or external influence is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a warning comment about code generation; no suspicious or malicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of an Enum class with two string members representing Docker builder versions. It includes a warning comment indicating the code was auto-generated, which is common in configuration or SDK code. There are no external data sources, no code injection mechanisms, and no network or file system operations. The code is clean, simple, and typical for an SDK or configuration module. No indicators of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated enumeration definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
