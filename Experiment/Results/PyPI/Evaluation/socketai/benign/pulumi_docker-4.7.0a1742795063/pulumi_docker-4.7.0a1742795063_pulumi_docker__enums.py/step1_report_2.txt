  "purpose": "This code defines an enumeration for Docker builder versions, likely used for configuration or version handling within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is purely defining constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The comment warns that the file was generated by a tool, but this does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enumeration definition with descriptive comments. The initial comments clarify the file is generated and should not be manually edited. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The enumeration appears to serve version management within a Docker or Pulumi context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and simply defines an enumeration for Docker builder versions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
