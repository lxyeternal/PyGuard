  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module defining an enumeration `BuilderVersion` with two string constants representing Docker builder versions.\n   - It includes comments indicating it was generated by Pulumi Terraform Bridge (`tfgen`), which is common in SDK or configuration code.\n   - There are no external data inputs, outputs, network operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Maliciousness and Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, auto-generated, and serves a configuration or versioning purpose.\n   - The \"malware\" score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, indicating no obfuscation is detected.\n\n3. **Potential Risks and Security Concerns:**\n   - Given the code's static nature and lack of external data handling, there are no evident security risks.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `malware` score of 0 is justified.\n   - The `obfuscated` score of 0 is justified.\n   - The confidence score of 1 indicates high certainty that the code is benign, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nThis code is a benign, auto-generated enumeration definition with no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, straightforward, and carries no security or malware risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
