  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different Docker builder versions, likely used for configuration or identification purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; the code solely defines an enumeration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted data or outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is static and only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard, generated by a known tool (Pulumi Terraform Bridge), with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enum definition describing Docker builder versions. It includes comments generated by a tool, warning against manual editing. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The structure and content are typical for configuration-related enumerations. No external data handling, input processing, or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple enumeration for Docker builder versions, generated by a legitimate tool. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
