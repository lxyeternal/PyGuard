  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for Docker builder versions, likely used for configuration or version selection in a larger infrastructure automation context.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only declares classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "Generated code warning suggests automated creation; no suspicious or malicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module defining an Enum for Docker builder versions. It includes documentation strings and a warning that the file is auto-generated by a tool. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears benign and serves a configuration or type-checking purpose within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, benign, and not malicious. It is simply defining constants for use elsewhere, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
