{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for Docker builder versions, likely used for configuration or versioning purposes within a larger deployment or management tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string definitions and enum members; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues are present; the code does not process external inputs or produce outputs with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code consists solely of static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated structures are present. The comments indicate it's auto-generated, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum class with two members representing Docker builder versions. The comments suggest it was generated by a tool (Pulumi Terraform Bridge), and it contains no dynamic or external data processing, no code injection, and no malicious constructs. It is a simple static declaration intended for use in other parts of a system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for version enumeration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
