  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for Docker builder versions, generated by Pulumi Terraform Bridge (tfgen).",
  "sources": "Static enumeration members within the code; no external data inputs or outputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process external input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - static definitions only; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with comments indicating code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static enum class with two string constants representing Docker builder versions. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or network activity. The comments indicate it was generated by a legitimate tool, and there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated enumeration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
