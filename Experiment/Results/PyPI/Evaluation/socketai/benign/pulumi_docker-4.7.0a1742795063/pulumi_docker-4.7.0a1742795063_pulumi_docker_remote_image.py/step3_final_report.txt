  "purpose": "Auto-generated Pulumi resource classes for managing Docker images, handling input parameters for resource configuration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'name', 'build', 'triggers', 'platform', and other resource properties.",
  "sinks": "No external network calls, data exfiltration, or command execution; data flows internally within resource property assignments.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource properties; no external data flows or untrusted data execution.",
  "anomalies": "Comments about a known bug ('Type and Name are switched') indicating code generation artifacts; no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi module for Docker image resources. It contains no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The resource definitions rely solely on configuration inputs, with no network activity or data leaks. The minor comments about bugs are documentation artifacts, not security issues. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, infrastructure-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi resource module for Docker images. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score accurately reflects its nature as infrastructure code with minimal security concerns.",
