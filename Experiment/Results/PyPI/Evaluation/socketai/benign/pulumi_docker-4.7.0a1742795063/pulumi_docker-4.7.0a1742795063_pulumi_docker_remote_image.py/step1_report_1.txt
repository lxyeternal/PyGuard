{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for managing Docker images with Pulumi infrastructure as code, including building, pulling, and resource management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as image names, build configurations, triggers, environment variables, and resource options from function arguments, class properties, and Pulumi input objects.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs resource properties like image IDs, repository digests, and triggers, which could potentially leak information if misused. No direct data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) flow into resource property assignments and class initializations; these influence resource creation and updates without involving external untrusted data streams. The properties are used internally for resource management.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated, with standard Pulumi class structures and resource management logic. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script provides structured definitions for managing Docker images via Pulumi, including resource classes, input types, and property accessors. The code follows typical patterns for infrastructure as code, with no signs of malicious behavior. It handles input/output properties securely, without external network communication, or suspicious data handling. The comments and code structure indicate auto-generation and standard usage scenarios. No anomalous or malicious logic is identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical auto-generated Pulumi resource module for Docker images, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It manages resource properties and inputs cleanly, with no suspicious behavior or security flaws detected.",
