{
  "purpose": "Defines Pulumi custom resources and input types for managing Docker images remotely, including building, pulling, and deleting images with associated configuration options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in class constructors (__init__, _internal_init), environment variables (none explicitly used), external module imports.",
  "sinks": "Methods that set resource properties (pulumi.set), resource creation via super().__init__, and property getters that retrieve resource state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource property setters, which are then used in resource initialization; resource properties are managed via Pulumi's get/set and stored for future reference.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is generated by Pulumi's tooling, with warnings explicitly stating not to edit manually. No malicious network connections, file modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated Pulumi resource definition for managing Docker images. It defines input types, state representations, and the resource class itself, with standard patterns for resource creation and property management. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malware patterns are evident. The code relies on Pulumi's SDK and external modules, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious data handling. The structure is consistent with typical infrastructure-as-code patterns, and the initial warnings reinforce that this is generated code meant for resource management, not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, generated Pulumi resource class for managing Docker images with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate infrastructure code intended for resource provisioning and management, with no indicators of malware, backdoors, or data leaks.",
