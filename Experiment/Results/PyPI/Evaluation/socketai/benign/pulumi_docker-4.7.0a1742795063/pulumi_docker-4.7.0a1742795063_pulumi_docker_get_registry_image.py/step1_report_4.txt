{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions and classes for retrieving Docker image metadata from a registry, primarily for use within Pulumi infrastructure as code workflows.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'insecure_skip_verify' and 'name' in functions; property getters in classes; external Pulumi runtime.invoke and invoke_output functions.",
  "sinks": "Pulumi runtime.invoke and invoke_output calls, which send requests to the Pulumi engine and potentially external services; property getters that access resource data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into invoke functions; these invoke the Pulumi provider to fetch data; the returned data flows through class properties to the user; apply functions process output data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard Pulumi SDK code for resource data retrieval. No obfuscated language features or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of standard Pulumi SDK constructs for resource data fetching: class definitions with property accessors, data validation, and wrapper functions to invoke external Pulumi providers. The functions facilitate retrieving Docker image metadata from a registry using Pulumi's invoke mechanism. The code does not include any network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The use of Pulumi's invoke functions aligns with typical infrastructure-as-code patterns. All external data sources are Pulumi engine calls, and no suspicious or unintended behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate Pulumi SDK code designed for infrastructure automation. It securely fetches Docker image metadata with proper data validation and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
