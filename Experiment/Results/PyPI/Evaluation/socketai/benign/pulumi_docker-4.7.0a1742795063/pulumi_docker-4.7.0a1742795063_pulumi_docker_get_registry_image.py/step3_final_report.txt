{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to retrieve Docker image metadata from a registry using Pulumi's SDK, facilitating infrastructure as code workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'name' and 'insecure_skip_verify' passed to the functions, which are used in API calls to Pulumi's invoke system.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only calls Pulumi APIs and returns structured data objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Pulumi's invoke functions, which then return data that is encapsulated in Pulumi resource result objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present; the code is auto-generated by Pulumi's Terraform bridge.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi SDK utility for fetching Docker registry image metadata. It performs type validation, uses Pulumi's invoke APIs correctly, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The structure and comments indicate auto-generation, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated Pulumi utility module for retrieving Docker image metadata. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
