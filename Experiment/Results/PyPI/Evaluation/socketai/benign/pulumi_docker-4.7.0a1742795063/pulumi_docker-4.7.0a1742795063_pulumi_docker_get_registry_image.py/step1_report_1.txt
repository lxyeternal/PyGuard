{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to retrieve Docker image metadata from a Docker registry, including image name, digest, and verification options, primarily for use in Pulumi infrastructure as code.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'insecure_skip_verify', 'name', and Pulumi invocation options. External library functions: pulumi.runtime.invoke, pulumi.get.",
  "sinks": "Data returned via pulumi.get and pulumi.runtime.invoke, which could potentially be used to leak data if misused, but these are controlled API calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to Pulumi's invoke functions, which retrieve registry image data; data flows from these external API calls back into the functions' return objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code strictly uses Pulumi's APIs to retrieve registry data.",
  "analysis": "The script defines data classes and functions to invoke Pulumi's Docker registry image data retrieval. It performs type checks on input parameters and calls Pulumi's runtime APIs to get data. There are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of external APIs is standard for infrastructure provisioning. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated constructs. It is well-structured, with proper parameter validation and usage of Pulumi's SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pulumi utility for fetching Docker registry image metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as intended for infrastructure automation with no hidden malicious intent.",
