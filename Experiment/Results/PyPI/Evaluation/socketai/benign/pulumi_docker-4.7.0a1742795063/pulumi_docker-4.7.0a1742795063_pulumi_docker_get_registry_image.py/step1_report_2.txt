{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes for retrieving Docker image metadata from a registry, used within Pulumi infrastructure as code workflows.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (`insecure_skip_verify`, `name`), and internal Pulumi invoke mechanisms fetching registry data.",
  "sinks": "Return values such as image ID, name, digest, and verification options, which could potentially be misused if manipulated, but are generally informational.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Pulumi invoke calls, which retrieve data from Docker registry services, then data is returned via class instances. No untrusted data is used in system commands or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be auto-generated with explicit warnings, contains no hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code. Use of standard Pulumi patterns and type checking is evident. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines data classes and functions for interacting with Docker registries through Pulumi. It uses typical data validation and Pulumi's invoke mechanisms. No suspicious code paths, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are observed. It does not perform any network operations directly or handle sensitive data beyond standard metadata retrieval. The structure and comments indicate intended use for infrastructure management, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated Pulumi utility module for Docker registry image info retrieval. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It strictly provides metadata access within an IaC context.",
