  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an auto-generated Pulumi resource wrapper for Docker networks, with no external untrusted inputs or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Security assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is boilerplate, with no malicious behavior. The warning about auto-generation indicates standard code, not malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — very low, as the code manages resources without insecure operations.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard resource class definitions with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Security assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious patterns or suspicious data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, standard boilerplate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines Pulumi resource types for Docker networks, with standard patterns and a warning about auto-generation.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on resource configuration.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; code is standard for infrastructure as code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a typical Pulumi resource wrapper, generated, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Security assessment:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1.\n\n**Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code being generated and clear.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the resource management nature and lack of insecure operations.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — the code is standard, auto-generated resource definitions with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a boilerplate Pulumi resource wrapper for Docker networks, generated by a tool, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for use in infrastructure management.",
