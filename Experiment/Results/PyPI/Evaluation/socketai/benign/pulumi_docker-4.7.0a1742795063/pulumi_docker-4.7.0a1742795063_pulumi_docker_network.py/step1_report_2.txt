{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource classes for managing Docker networks, including input arguments, resource state, and resource creation methods.",
  "sources": "Data inputs come from constructor parameters, property setters, and the imported modules such as 'pulumi' and internal modules (_utilities, outputs, _inputs).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include resource initialization, property setters, and 'pulumi.set' calls where data is assigned to resource properties.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs and method parameters through property assignments and into resource state during initialization, with 'pulumi.set' tracking property values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears standard for Pulumi resource definitions, with no obfuscated or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource class for managing Docker networks, including argument classes, state classes, and resource creation logic. The use of 'pulumi.set' and 'pulumi.get' for property management aligns with Pulumi best practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, network exfiltration, or obfuscated code. It is an auto-generated boilerplate for resource management, with comments warning against manual edits, indicating standard code generation for infrastructure as code. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or insecure patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi resource implementation for Docker networks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for infrastructure management purposes only.",
