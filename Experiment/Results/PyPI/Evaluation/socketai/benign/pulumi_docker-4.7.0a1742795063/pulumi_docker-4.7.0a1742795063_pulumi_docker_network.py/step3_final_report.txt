{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated Pulumi resource wrapper for Docker networks, managing resource properties and configurations without external untrusted input sources.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, property setters/getters within the Pulumi SDK context, no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Standard Pulumi SDK calls (`pulumi.set`, `pulumi.get`) for resource property management; no data leaks, network connections, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource property assignments; no external or untrusted data processed maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Generated code with warning comments; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes for Docker networks, with typical property management and resource creation patterns. It is auto-generated, with no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. The structure is straightforward, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi SDK wrapper for Docker network resources. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is safe for use in infrastructure management.",
