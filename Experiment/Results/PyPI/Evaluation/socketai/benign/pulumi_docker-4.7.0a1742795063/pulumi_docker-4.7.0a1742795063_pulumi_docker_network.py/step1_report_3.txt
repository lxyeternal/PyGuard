{
  "purpose": "Defines Pulumi resource types and input/output structures for managing Docker networks programmatically.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (pulumi, typing, sys) and uses function parameters and class constructors to process input data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily sets and gets configuration parameters for resource provisioning.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class constructors, which initialize resource properties; property getters and setters manage internal state.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes a warning comment indicating auto-generation by a Pulumi Terraform bridge tool; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed; no obfuscated code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource and input type definition for Docker networks, with standard usage of property getters/setters and resource initialization patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The warning about auto-generation suggests that this is generated code, not intentionally malicious. No suspicious data handling, code injection, or security risks are present. The code's structure is consistent with legitimate infrastructure-as-code practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated Pulumi resource definition for Docker networks. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this module. It functions solely to facilitate resource configuration and management.",
