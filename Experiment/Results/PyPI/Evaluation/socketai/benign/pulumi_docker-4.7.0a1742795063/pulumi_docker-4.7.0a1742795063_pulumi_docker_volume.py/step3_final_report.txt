{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes for managing Docker volumes, including resource arguments, state, and creation logic. It is auto-generated boilerplate code for infrastructure as code (IaC).",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructors, property getters/setters, and class initializations.",
  "sinks": "Resource registration and property management within Pulumi's internal system; no external data leaks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through class constructors and property accessors into resource registration; no malicious external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Comments indicating a known bug ('Type and Name are switched') and the code being generated by Pulumi Terraform Bridge; no malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard, auto-generated resource management boilerplate for Pulumi. It contains no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The data flow is limited to resource configuration, with no external or suspicious data handling. The known bug comment is an internal note, not a security concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to potential misconfiguration but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This dependency is a typical, safe Pulumi resource module for Docker volumes. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor risk score reflects standard concerns about untrusted input influencing resource configuration, but no active threats are present.",
