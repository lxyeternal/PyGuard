  "purpose": "Unit testing for the KeywordProcessor class to verify correct addition and removal of keywords based on provided test cases.",
  "sources": "Reading test cases from 'test/keyword_remover_test_cases.json' file.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; all data sources are local files and variables.",
  "flows": "The code reads JSON test cases, processes them with KeywordProcessor methods, and asserts expected conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. Usage of standard libraries and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads test cases from a JSON file, uses the 'flashtext' KeywordProcessor to add and remove keywords, and verifies the length of the processor's keywords list before and after removal. It employs standard unit testing patterns, reads local files, and performs straightforward data manipulations. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are detected. The code appears solely for testing purposes with no external or covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward unit test suite for keyword processing, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It handles local files and data without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
