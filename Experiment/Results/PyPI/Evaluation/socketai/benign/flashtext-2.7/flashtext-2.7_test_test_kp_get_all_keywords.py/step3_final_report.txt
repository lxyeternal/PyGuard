{
  "purpose": "This code is a simple unit test verifying the addition and retrieval of hardcoded keywords in the KeywordProcessor library.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded keywords ('j2ee', 'colour') added via add_keyword method.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no external data, network calls, or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Keywords are added to the internal data structure and retrieved; no external data flows or malicious data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign unit test that adds fixed keywords and verifies their presence. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or modify system state. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The use of third-party library 'flashtext' is standard and safe in this context. The code's structure and logic are simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign unit test with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. All signals indicate a non-threatening, standard testing script.",
