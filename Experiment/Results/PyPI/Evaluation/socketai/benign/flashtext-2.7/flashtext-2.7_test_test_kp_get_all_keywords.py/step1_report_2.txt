  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for the KeywordProcessor class from the flashtext library, testing the addition of keywords and retrieval of all keywords.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded keywords added via add_keyword method within the test_get_all_keywords function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or lead to data leakage or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded keywords in add_keyword to the get_all_keywords method, which retrieves the stored keywords.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code uses standard library and widely-used open-source packages. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and open-source libraries, sets up a simple unit test class, and tests the functionality of adding and retrieving keywords with the flashtext KeywordProcessor. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, utilizing well-known packages with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a third-party library with no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and does not pose supply chain threats.",
