  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The subprocess call to 'py.test' is static and not influenced by external input. No malicious behavior or malware detected. The code is a standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the benign nature but acknowledge the subprocess call as a minor potential concern.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The subprocess call is typical for testing, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the subprocess call potentially executing arbitrary code if the test environment is compromised. Still, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; subprocess call is standard but should be noted as a potential risk if environment is compromised.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard setup with subprocess call to 'py.test'. No malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the subprocess call is a common pattern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard setup with a subprocess call to run tests. No malicious activity or data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent; the subprocess call is typical.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; subprocess call is a controlled, standard practice for testing. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The subprocess call is standard for running tests and does not involve malicious code or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Code:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static subprocess call, the risk is minimal. The minor risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting the potential if the testing environment is compromised, but this is standard and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is typical for Python packaging, with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent. The subprocess call to 'py.test' is a common pattern for running tests and does not indicate malicious activity, especially since it is static and controlled within the setup script.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed to the scores. They accurately reflect the benign nature of the code, with a very low security risk due to the subprocess call, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (appropriate given the context)  \n\nThe code is safe, standard, and does not pose security threats.",
