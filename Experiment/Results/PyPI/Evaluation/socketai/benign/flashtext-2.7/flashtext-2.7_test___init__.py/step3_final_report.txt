  "purpose": "The code is a benign Python utility performing standard data handling operations without suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, standard input, external files, or network (if any).",
  "sinks": "Console output, file writes, network transmissions (if any).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), with no suspicious or malicious pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as simple, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.9). No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious flows are present. The security risk score is conservatively set at 0.2, reflecting minimal potential concerns but acknowledging limited context. The absence of code snippets limits detailed analysis, but descriptions support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the description, indicating a low security risk and no malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
