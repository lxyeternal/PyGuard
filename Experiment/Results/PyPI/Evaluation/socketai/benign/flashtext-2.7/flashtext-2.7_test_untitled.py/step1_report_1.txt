{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and manipulates instances of the KeywordProcessor class, adding and removing keywords based on test case data, and calculates the number of keywords in each processor.",
  "sources": "Reading test case data from 'test.test_kp_len' module and attributes like 'test_cases'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to vulnerabilities; all data appears to be from a test case source within the code.",
  "flows": "Test case data flows from the 'test_case' dictionary into keyword processor methods, and the manipulation results are stored in variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports test data, initializes keyword processors, adds and removes keywords according to test case data, and computes lengths. All data sources are static test data, with no external input or network communication. The logic involves simple dictionary and list operations with no risky or suspicious code. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads, and the code functions solely as a test setup or processing routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward manipulation of test data for keyword processing without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard test setup or utility code with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
