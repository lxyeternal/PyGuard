{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and manipulates keyword processors using provided test case data, primarily for keyword addition and removal operations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from 'test_case' object properties ('keyword_dict' and 'remove_keyword_dict'), which are used to populate the KeywordProcessor instances.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable functions; no data is sent externally, stored insecurely, or used unsafely.",
  "flows": "Keywords are added from 'keyword_dict', some are conditionally removed based on 'remove_keyword_dict', then new KeywordProcessor instances are created with filtered data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns. The code performs standard data filtering and object configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code loads test data, initializes keyword processing objects, adds keywords, removes specified keywords, and creates a second keyword processor with filtered data. It performs no network activity, no file manipulation, and no execution of untrusted code. It uses straightforward library functions without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard test setup for keyword processing functionality. No malicious intent, suspicious activities, or security risks are evident based on this code fragment.",
