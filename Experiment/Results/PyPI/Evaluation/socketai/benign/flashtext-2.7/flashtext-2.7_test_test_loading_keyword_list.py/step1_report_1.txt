  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for demonstrating the usage of the flashtext KeywordProcessor for keyword extraction and replacement in sentences.",
  "sources": "Input sentences 'I know java and product management' and 'sentence' variables",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data output or system modification points",
  "flows": "Input sentences are processed through add_keywords_from_list, extract_keywords, and replace_keywords methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Logging is standard; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the flashtext library to handle keyword processing, sets up a simple unit test class with setup and teardown logging, adds a list of keywords, extracts them from a sentence, and verifies the correctness. All code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The functions used are standard and safe, and no external data or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test demonstrating the functionality of a keyword processing library. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to serve a normal testing purpose.",
