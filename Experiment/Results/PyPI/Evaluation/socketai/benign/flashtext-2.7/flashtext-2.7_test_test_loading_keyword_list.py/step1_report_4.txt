  "purpose": "Unit testing for keyword extraction and replacement using the flashtext library.",
  "sources": "Input sentences 'sentence' and 'sentence_new' in test methods.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input sentences are processed through the KeywordProcessor methods, but no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of standard libraries and testing framework.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'flashtext' library for keyword processing, sets up basic unit tests to verify adding keywords, extraction, and replacement. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior identified. The test simply verifies functionality of a known library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a known open-source library without any signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
