{
  "purpose": "This code defines unit tests for the KeywordProcessor class from the flashtext library, aimed at verifying keyword extraction functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON file 'test/keyword_extractor_test_cases.json' for test cases.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions process untrusted input directly; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads test data from a file, then processes that data with the KeywordProcessor, which extracts keywords from sentences.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. Uses standard library functions and testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, sets up a unittest class, loads test cases from a JSON file, and tests keyword extraction with different case sensitivities. No external network access, no data leakage, and no system modifications are present. All code appears standard for a testing environment, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code insertion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for the flashtext library. It reads test cases from a JSON file and verifies keyword extraction. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected. It appears safe and solely intended for testing purposes.",
