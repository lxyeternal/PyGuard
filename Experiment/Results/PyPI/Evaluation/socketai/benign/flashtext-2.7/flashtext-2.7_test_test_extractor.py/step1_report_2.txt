{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit testing script for verifying the functionality of the KeywordProcessor class from the flashtext library, specifically testing keyword extraction features with different configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads a JSON file 'test/keyword_extractor_test_cases.json' containing test cases for keyword extraction.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful manner. The code does not perform any network operations, file writes, or system modifications based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Test cases are loaded from a JSON file (source), then keywords are added to the KeywordProcessor (sink), and extraction results are validated (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or malicious payloads. Use of standard libraries and straightforward test structure.",
  "analysis": "The script loads test cases from a JSON file and performs unit tests to verify keyword extraction functionality using the flashtext library. It includes no network operations, system modifications, or code execution outside standard testing. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is well-structured for testing and does not exhibit any signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit testing script for the flashtext library's keyword extraction features, with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It solely performs input loading, keyword processing, and result verification within a controlled testing environment.",
