  "purpose": "Unit testing for keyword extraction functionality using the flashtext library.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON test cases from 'test/keyword_extractor_test_cases.json'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input data in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON data, processes it with KeywordProcessor, and asserts expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward unit testing using the unittest framework. It loads test cases from a JSON file, initializes KeywordProcessor objects, adds keywords, and performs assertions. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted user input that could cause security issues. The use of the 'flashtext' library is standard, and the code appears to be a typical test suite with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for keyword extraction and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply loads predefined data, performs processing, and asserts correctness. There are no security concerns related to supply chain attacks, malware, or data leaks.",
