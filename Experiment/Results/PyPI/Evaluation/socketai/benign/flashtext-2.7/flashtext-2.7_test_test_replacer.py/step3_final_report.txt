  "purpose": "Unit testing keyword replacement functionality using flashtext's KeywordProcessor with test cases loaded from an external JSON file.",
  "sources": "Reading test cases from 'test/keyword_extractor_test_cases.json'; adding keywords to KeywordProcessor; regex matching for verification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network or system calls; verification is internal.",
  "flows": "Loading JSON test cases -> adding keywords to KeywordProcessor -> replacing keywords -> regex verification -> assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; reliance on external JSON file could pose risk if malicious, but this is outside the code scope.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite that loads test cases, performs keyword replacements, and verifies correctness. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The regex is safe, and the external JSON file is a dependency but not a security concern within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard testing tasks. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The only minor risk is external test data, which is typical in testing environments. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 to account for external data dependency.",
