  "purpose": "Unit testing for keyword replacement functionality using the flashtext library.",
  "sources": "Reading test cases from 'test/keyword_extractor_test_cases.json' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code processes data and performs replacements internally. No network, file, or system calls are evident that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading JSON test cases -> constructing KeywordProcessor -> replacing keywords in sentences -> comparing with expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python unittest class that loads test cases from a JSON file, configures a KeywordProcessor, performs keyword replacements, and verifies outcomes. All data handling appears straightforward, and there are no indications of malicious intent. Usage of external library 'flashtext' is standard, and no suspicious network or file activities are present. The code includes comments for handling known issues but no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test implementation for verifying keyword replacement logic. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security threats are detected.",
