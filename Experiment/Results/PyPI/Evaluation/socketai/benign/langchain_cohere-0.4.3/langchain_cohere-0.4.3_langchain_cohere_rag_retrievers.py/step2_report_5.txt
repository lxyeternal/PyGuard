  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code relies on external APIs (Cohere's chat models) and standard data handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n- The functions are well-structured, and the flow is typical for retrieval-augmented systems.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with no evident bugs or logical flaws.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any malicious behavior, nor do they find suspicious network calls or data leaks.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk:** Given the absence of secrets, backdoors, or malicious code, the low scores (0.1-0.2) seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific issues:\n- The only potential concern is **untrusted data** flowing into document objects, but this is typical for retrieval systems and does not imply malicious intent.\n- The code relies on external API responses, which could, in theory, contain sensitive data if the model responds with such, but this is more a data privacy concern than a security flaw.\n\n### Scoring assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk, which is reasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores given are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments seem accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n**Based on all reports and the code review, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal security risk, mainly due to untrusted data flow, which is typical in such systems)\n\n**Note:** The low risk score is justified given the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, and the code's purpose is standard for retrieval-augmented systems.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security concerns.\n- The scores reflect this assessment appropriately.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1**.",
