{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to convert various representations of tools into Cohere-compatible formats, parse agent outputs, and facilitate tool invocation within a larger AI framework.",
  "sources": "Reads data from tool definitions (dicts, classes, functions), agent actions, and JSON-serialized tool inputs.",
  "sinks": "Processes tool inputs and outputs, potentially converting or serializing data, but does not execute external commands or perform I/O operations directly.",
  "flows": "Tool definitions are converted to Cohere formats; agent actions are generated from model outputs; tool input data flows from agent_action.tool_input to tool call parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs typical data transformations and parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data transformation tasks: converting various tool representations to Cohere API schemas, handling JSON serialization/deserialization, and parsing agent message outputs. It includes error handling for data parsing issues. There are no indications of malicious logic such as network calls, file system access, or system commands. The functions rely on standard data manipulation, and the only external interactions are schema conversions and parsing. No suspicious or malicious behavior or code obfuscation is evident. The code seems to serve as part of a larger framework for AI agent tool management and output parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for managing AI agent tools and parsing outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in the provided code. It is well-structured for its purpose and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
