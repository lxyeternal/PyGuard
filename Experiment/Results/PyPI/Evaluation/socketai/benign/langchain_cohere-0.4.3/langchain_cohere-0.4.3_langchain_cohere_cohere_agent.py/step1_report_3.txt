{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to convert various tool representations into Cohere-compatible formats, parse agent outputs, and handle tool data structures within a language model framework.",
  "sources": "Input data includes tool definitions (dicts, classes, or callables), agent actions, and message contents. Data is read from parameters, function schemas, and message attributes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into tool parameters, function call arguments, or message contents, potentially affecting downstream processing or output generation.",
  "flows": "Source data (tool definitions or message outputs) is converted into Cohere tool formats; agent actions are derived from message tool_calls; message contents are parsed for final outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward data conversions. No suspicious network or system calls are present. No dynamic code execution or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data transformation and parsing tasks. It converts various representations of tools into Cohere's format, handling both V1 and V2 schemas. It processes agent output messages, extracting tool calls and formatting them into actions, or returning final results. All functions use standard Python patterns and library calls without unusual constructs or obfuscation. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code focuses on schema validation, JSON parsing, and data structure manipulation, which are typical for such frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility module for handling tool schemas and agent message parsing within a language model framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate schema conversions and message parsing without security concerns.",
