  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent utility module for AI tool schema conversion and output parsing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage are evident. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2) due to JSON deserialization of untrusted data, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments."
