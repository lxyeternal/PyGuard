  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting tool schemas, parsing agent outputs, and handling data serialization/deserialization within an AI agent framework.",
  "sources": "json.loads() on agent_action.tool_input, message content, additional_kwargs, and schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() deserializing untrusted input, message content, and tool parameters.",
  "flows": "Source: untrusted JSON input or message content -> sink: json.loads() parsing into data structures or parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; standard data handling and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs schema conversions, message parsing, and data validation without executing external commands or network activity. JSON deserialization is used on potentially untrusted data but is typical in such contexts. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The functions include validation steps and handle errors gracefully, indicating standard utility code for AI tool management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent utility module for AI tool schema conversion and output parsing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage are evident. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2) due to JSON deserialization of untrusted data, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments.",
