{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules related to Cohere and langchain integrations, likely to facilitate NLP tasks such as summarization, chat, embeddings, retrieval, reasoning, re-ranking, and SQL operations.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from external libraries (langchain_cohere). No user input or dynamic data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or output. No code execution, network communication, or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are only static imports. No runtime data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors detected. All imports are from publicly available packages and are standard for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration for module exports. It does not contain executable logic, user input handling, or data processing. No potential security issues or malicious behaviors are evident in these statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import declarations used to access various NLP and AI modules from the langchain_cohere library. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
