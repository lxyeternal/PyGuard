{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and functions related to the langchain_cohere package, likely for natural language processing, summarization, retrieval, reranking, and SQL operations.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from imported modules and functions, which may internally handle input data but are not explicitly shown here.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or environment variable usage in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code primarily involves importing functions and classes; there are no data flows from sources to sinks in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, mainly defining exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and functions from the langchain_cohere package and defines an __all__ list for exports. There is no indication of malicious logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose appears to be setting up package exports, with no data handling, network activity, or sensitive operations shown. The absence of dynamic execution, user input, or environment variable access further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module import and export declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger package meant for NLP tasks. No malicious intent or security concerns are detected in this snippet.",
