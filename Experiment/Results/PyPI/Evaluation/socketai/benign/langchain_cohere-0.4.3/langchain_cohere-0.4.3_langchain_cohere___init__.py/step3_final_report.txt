  "purpose": "Module setup exporting classes and functions from the langchain_cohere package",
  "sources": "Import statements from langchain_cohere modules",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data sinks involved",
  "flows": "Static import declarations; no data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export setup with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements and an __all__ list defining exports. No executable logic, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be a standard module setup for exposing API components. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It only declares imports and exports, with no suspicious or risky behavior.",
