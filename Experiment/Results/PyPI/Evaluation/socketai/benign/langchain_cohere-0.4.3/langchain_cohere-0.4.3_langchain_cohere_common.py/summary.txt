  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented data structure with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate. Minor adjustments could set securityRisk explicitly to 0 for consistency, but the current assessment is accurate."
