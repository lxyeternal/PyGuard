  "purpose": "Define a data structure for representing citations within text, including start/end indices, text content, associated documents, and document IDs.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses and typing modules, class attribute definitions, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely defines a data class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for data class creation and type annotations. It defines a data class 'CohereCitation' with multiple fields, including start/end indices, text, documents list, and document IDs set. The docstrings clarify the purpose and usage of each attribute. No external data sources, network operations, or unsafe data handling are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data model without embedded logic or executable behavior that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented data class for managing citation metadata. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low, and there is no evidence of malware.",
