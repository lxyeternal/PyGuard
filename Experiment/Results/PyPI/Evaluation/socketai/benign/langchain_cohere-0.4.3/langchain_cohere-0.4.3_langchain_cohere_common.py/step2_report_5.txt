  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward data class definition.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code contains only descriptive docstrings and standard library imports.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The only potential concern could be the inclusion of the `document_ids` set, but since it's a field meant to hold deduplicated document IDs, its presence is justified and safe.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not perform any operations, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The documentation is clear and standard.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, justified by the absence of any risky behavior.\n- **Overall risk:** The code is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reported scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.1 at most, but 0 is justified)\n\nThis code is a safe, standard data class with no malicious or security issues.",
