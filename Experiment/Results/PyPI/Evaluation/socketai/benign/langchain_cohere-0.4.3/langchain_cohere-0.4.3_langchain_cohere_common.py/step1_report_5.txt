  "purpose": "Define a data structure for representing citations with detailed information in a text generation context.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data during execution.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or external interactions in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no external data operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward data class definitions with comprehensive docstrings. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Python dataclass named CohereCitation intended to store citation details including start/end indices, text, related documents, and document IDs. The class uses standard Python typing and data structures such as List and Set. The docstrings clarify usage but do not perform any operations or contain sensitive data. No external data input, output, or dynamic execution is evident. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign data structure definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a container for citation information in a larger application context.",
