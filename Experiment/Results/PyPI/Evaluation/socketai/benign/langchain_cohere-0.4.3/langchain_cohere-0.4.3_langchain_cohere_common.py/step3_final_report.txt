  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'CohereCitation' to represent citation metadata with start/end indices, text, associated documents, and document IDs.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the class fields are assigned directly or via data structures within the class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the class only stores data without processing or external output.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data assignment within the class; no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward data class with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a simple data class with fields for citation metadata, and includes detailed docstrings. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. The class is purely declarative, serving as a data container. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk close to 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented data structure with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate. Minor adjustments could set securityRisk explicitly to 0 for consistency, but the current assessment is accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
