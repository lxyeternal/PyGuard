  "purpose": "Define a data class CohereCitation for handling citation metadata in text generation, including start/end positions, text, and associated documents.",
  "sources": "None (no input/output operations); code only defines a class with fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static data structure without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. The docstrings are clear and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports data classes and typing modules, then defines a data class with fields for citation metadata, including start/end indices, text, documents, and document IDs. The class includes detailed docstrings explaining each field. There are no external data reads, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-documented data class used for citation metadata in text processing. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code identified.",
