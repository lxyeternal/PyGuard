  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is a simple data class with descriptive comments. No external sources, data flows, or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate, no issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward data class, no external data or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous; detailed explanation, no suspicious activity, no external data, no obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.  \n- **Note:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, but given the code's nature, this seems overly cautious. It is just a data class.  \n- **Recommendation:** It could be set to 0 unless there's context implying risk, but the small score is acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward data class, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous; no external data, no suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a simple data class with no executable logic, external data sources, or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports; no malicious code or behaviors detected.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is clear and well-documented.  \n- **Security risk:** Very low; only a data structure with no external interactions.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a score of 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate; the current 0.1 in one report is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                | No malicious behavior or code present.                       |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                | Clear, well-documented code.                                 |\n| Security Risk  | 0                | No external data, no dynamic or unsafe operations.          |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.**",
