{
  "purpose": "The code implements a multi-hop reasoning agent using Cohere and Langchain components, orchestrating prompts, model invocation, and citation parsing to complete tasks.",
  "sources": "Input variables such as 'agent_steps', 'chain_input', and 'intermediate_steps' from the input dictionary; data read during citation parsing and document conversion.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands; data is processed internally within memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through prompt generation, model binding, output parsing, and finally to citation addition, with intermediate steps involving conversion and parsing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a multi-hop agent that uses prompts and a language model to generate reasoning steps, then parses and adds citations based on intermediate observations. It employs standard practices for chaining components, with no external system interactions or suspicious patterns. The citation addition class safely manipulates data structures, and the overall flow is transparent. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an AI reasoning agent with citation management. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
