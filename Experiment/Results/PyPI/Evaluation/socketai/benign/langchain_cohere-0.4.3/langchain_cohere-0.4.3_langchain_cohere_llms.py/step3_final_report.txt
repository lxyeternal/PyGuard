{
  "purpose": "A wrapper for Cohere's API, managing API keys via environment variables, handling retries, and providing synchronous and asynchronous text generation methods.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COHERE_API_KEY' via secret_from_env, API request parameters, response data from generate calls.",
  "sinks": "Response handling in _process_response, no untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Secret retrieval from environment -> client setup -> API request -> response processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors, no network exfiltration, no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages API keys using SecretStr and environment variables, sets up API clients with proper validation, and implements retry logic via external decorator. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The response handling is straightforward, with no code injection or data leakage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's structure and behavior. The overall security posture is minimal risk, primarily due to environment variable reliance, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SDK wrapper for Cohere's API, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and appropriate.",
