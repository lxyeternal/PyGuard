  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the security implications, consistency of scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages API keys via environment variables, sets up clients, and provides retry logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly identifies no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- The low security risk score (0.1) aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.  \n- The malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- The high confidence (0.9) is reasonable given the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on environment variable secret handling, retry decorators, and API interaction. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with Report 1, no malware or obfuscation.  \n- Slightly higher risk score (0.2) perhaps reflecting cautiousness but still justified.  \n- Malware remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment variable handling, secret management, and standard API client setup. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Well-aligned with previous reports.  \n- Slightly higher confidence score, justified by the thoroughness.  \n- Malware=0 remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar findings—API key via environment variables, no suspicious code, standard retry logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The zero risk score here is consistent with the analysis; no vulnerabilities or malicious code are present.  \n- Confidence=1 is justified given the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—API key management, no suspicious code, standard API client setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with prior assessments; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varying, but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard API client code with proper secret handling.\n- **Confidence:** High across all reports, justified by the detailed reasoning.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments & Final Estimation**\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified; no adjustments needed.\n- The only area to consider is the very low risk scores, which are appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation (Post-Review):**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Confidence |\n|---------|--------------|-------|------------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1–0.2** | 0.9–1.0 |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is a standard, secure SDK wrapper for Cohere's API, with no malicious or obfuscated components, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, consistent, and justified. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present. The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for API interaction.",
