  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors, standard retry logic, API keys managed via environment variables.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of environment variables for secrets is best practice.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1—secure secret handling, no suspicious code, standard retry decorators, API interactions straightforward.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent detected; code is a typical API client with proper security practices.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—API key via environment, no obfuscation, no suspicious code, retry logic standard.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; appears to be a legitimate SDK implementation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—secure secret management, no suspicious behavior, clear data flow.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard code for API interaction.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—secure handling, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Security & Malware:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate a malware score of 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk primarily due to reliance on environment variables for secrets, which is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Security Risk:** Low, given the proper handling of secrets and standard API interaction patterns.\n- **Code Quality & Intent:** The code is a typical SDK wrapper for Cohere's API, with retry logic, environment validation, and secure secret management.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, reflecting standard secret handling practices)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and aligns with best practices for API client implementations. No supply chain security concerns are evident.",
