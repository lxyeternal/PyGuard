{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for integrating Cohere's language models into an application, managing API keys, retry logic, and request handling.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from environment variables via secret_from_env, and reads user input prompts in _call and _acall methods.",
  "sinks": "Sends API requests to Cohere's endpoints with provided parameters and prompt data.",
  "flows": "Source: secret_from_env retrieves API key → API request with prompt and parameters → Response handling and text processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets in the code; API keys are retrieved securely from environment variables. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected. No obfuscation or misleading variables. Retry logic is standard. The use of environment variables for secrets is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Cohere LLM interface with retry capabilities, environment-based API key management, and input/output handling. It validates the environment and initializes clients securely. No embedded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The API key management uses environment variables and secret handling, which is standard practice. No data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or system manipulation code is present. All operations are standard API calls with controlled parameters. The code's structure and functions are typical for an SDK wrapper and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for interfacing with Cohere's language models, with appropriate security practices in place for API key management. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
