  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating retry decorators with exponential backoff and cleaning up tool description strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'max_retries', 'name', and 'description'; internal regex operations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code operates on input parameters and internal variables only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in regex and retry configuration; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; regex patterns are straightforward; exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: one creates a retry decorator with exponential backoff based on the 'tenacity' library, supporting different versions of 'cohere' error handling; the other removes specific signature and Args sections from tool descriptions using regex. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. Exception handling is appropriate, regex usage is safe, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs utility functions safely, and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. All signals indicate a low security risk with malware probability set to 0.",
