{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for retrying operations with exponential backoff and for cleaning up tool descriptions by removing signatures and argument sections.",
  "sources": "Inputs include the 'max_retries' parameter, the 'name' and 'description' strings for removing signature parts, and external libraries (cohere, tenacity, re, logging).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks, system compromise, or malicious effects. No data is transmitted, stored insecurely, or executed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (max_retries, name, description) are processed through functions to generate retry decorators or modify description strings, with no untrusted data flow leading to external systems or vulnerable points.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Use of regex for description cleanup is safe and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging, regex, and typing modules, as well as external libraries 'cohere' and 'tenacity'. The '_create_retry_decorator' function creates a retry decorator with configurable max retries, handling potential 'CohereError' exceptions if the library is present, or generic exceptions otherwise. It uses exponential backoff for retries, which is standard. The '_remove_signature_from_tool_description' function cleans up description strings by removing signature and Args sections using regex substitutions. No malicious patterns, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code only manipulates strings and creates decorators; it does not perform any network communication, data storage, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module intended for retry logic and description formatting. It does not contain malware or security risks and appears safe.",
