{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for retry logic with exponential backoff and description processing for tools.",
  "sources": "Imports (logging, re, typing, cohere, tenacity); functions process input parameters and manipulate strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input data; no network, file, or sensitive data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; functions operate on input parameters and internal logic only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. Usage of regular expressions is straightforward and safe. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging and defines a mapping for JSON types, then creates a retry decorator supporting different versions of the cohere library, with exponential backoff. It also defines a string manipulation function to clean up tool descriptions by removing signatures and Args sections. There are no network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The functions serve utility purposes related to retries and string cleaning, with no handling of sensitive data or external inputs that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for retry logic and string processing, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any network operations, data handling of sensitive info, or obfuscated code. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
