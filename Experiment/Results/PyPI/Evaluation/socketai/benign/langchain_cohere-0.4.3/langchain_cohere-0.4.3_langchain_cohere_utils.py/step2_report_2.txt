  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is benign, performing utility functions for retries and string cleanup.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no external data leaks, or dangerous code. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code remains utility-focused, safe regex use, no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — perhaps slightly high but acceptable given the minimal risk.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or code, just string manipulation and retry setup.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar utility functions, safe regex, no external data handling.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward utility functions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is safe, utility-based, with no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the findings.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — the slightly elevated risk in some reports might be due to conservative defaulting, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard utility module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores and reasoning in all reports are aligned with the actual code content.",
