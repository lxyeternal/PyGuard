{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for retrying operations with exponential backoff and for cleaning up tool descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; the code mainly defines functions and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable operations.",
  "flows": "The functions define behaviors but do not process untrusted external input directly within the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, including logging, re, and typing, as well as third-party libraries like cohere and tenacity. The _create_retry_decorator function dynamically creates a retry decorator with configurable max retries, handling specific exception types, and uses exponential backoff. The exception handling considers the presence of cohere.error.CohereError, otherwise defaults to general Exception. The _remove_signature_from_tool_description function removes specific patterns from tool descriptions using regex substitutions, targeting signatures and Args sections. No untrusted input handling, data leakage, or malicious code logic is present. The code appears to be utility functions for robustness and description formatting without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
