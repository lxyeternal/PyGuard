{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for retrying operations involving the Cohere API and for cleaning tool descriptions.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration parameters (max_retries), importing modules, and function arguments (name, description).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted input sources or outputs data to external locations. The functions manipulate strings and configure retries.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The retry decorator may wrap API calls elsewhere, but within this code, no direct untrusted data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The regex appears straightforward for string cleanup. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and the 'cohere' SDK, with conditional handling for different versions. It defines a retry decorator supporting multiple versions and sets up exponential backoff with configurable retries. The string cleaning function removes specific signature and Args sections from descriptions, using regex. There are no signs of malicious activity or malicious intent; the code appears well-structured for its utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs utility functions for retries and string processing without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain any security risks or malware indicators. Overall, it appears safe and purposefully designed.",
