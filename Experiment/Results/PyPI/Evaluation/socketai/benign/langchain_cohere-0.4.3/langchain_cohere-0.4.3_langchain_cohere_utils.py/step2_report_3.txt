  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code creates retry decorators and cleans descriptions; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The reasoning is sound, and no issues are identified.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar utility functions with no evident malicious activity. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to cautiousness.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, just a conservative risk score. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; utility functions with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Utility functions, no malicious activity, straightforward regex use.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Safe and benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are very low, indicating benign utility code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code snippets are utility functions for retry logic and string cleanup, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- Regex usage is straightforward and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The exception handling for 'cohere' library versions is cautious but not malicious.\n- The overall security posture is benign.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across all reports; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign utility module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores should reflect this, with all at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
