  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for retry with exponential backoff and description cleanup.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The regex is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1).\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no untrusted data handling, safe regex.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9. The minor security risk could be due to the regex or potential misuse in context, but nothing malicious is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. No evidence of malware.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with full confidence (1) and no security risk.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no data leaks, safe regex.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no untrusted data handling, no anomalies.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same utility functions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; all are 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is straightforward utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- The minor security risk in report 2 (0.1) could be justified by the regex's potential for misuse if misapplied, but given the current code, it's acceptable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to regex manipulation, which is safe here)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, safe, and well-understood. The scoring across reports aligns with this conclusion.",
