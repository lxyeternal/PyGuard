  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code consists of utility functions: one creates a retry decorator with exponential backoff, and the other cleans up description strings.\n- No network activity, data transmission, or external system modifications are present.\n- The code handles exceptions related to the 'cohere' library, with fallback to general exceptions, which is standard practice.\n- Regex usage is straightforward and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The functions operate on input parameters and internal logic only.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Benign utility functions, no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 — the small security risk score seems slightly high given the code's nature; perhaps a 0.0 or 0.1 is acceptable, but the reasoning aligns with minimal concern.\n- **Comments:** The confidence is high, and no suspicious activity is detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with safe regex and exception handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for retry logic and description cleanup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal concern, which is appropriate given the code's scope.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.\n- The only minor point is the small security risk score in report 2, which could be slightly reduced to 0, but given the context, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a straightforward utility module for retry logic and string cleanup. It employs standard libraries, handles exceptions appropriately, and uses regex safely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's benign nature.",
