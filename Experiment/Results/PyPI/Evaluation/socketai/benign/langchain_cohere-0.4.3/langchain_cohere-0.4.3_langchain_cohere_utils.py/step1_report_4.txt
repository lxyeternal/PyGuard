{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions for retry logic with exponential backoff and for cleaning up tool description strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, function arguments, and attributes within functions such as 'max_retries', 'name', and 'description'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks, such as network transmissions, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The functions process input parameters and return modified values without external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, sets up a logger, and defines a dictionary for type conversions. The '_create_retry_decorator' function configures a retry mechanism with exponential backoff based on the 'cohere' library error handling, with fallback exception handling. The '_remove_signature_from_tool_description' function employs regex substitutions to clean descriptions, removing specific signature and Args sections. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be part of a utility module aimed at robust API calling and text processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for retry logic and text manipulation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
