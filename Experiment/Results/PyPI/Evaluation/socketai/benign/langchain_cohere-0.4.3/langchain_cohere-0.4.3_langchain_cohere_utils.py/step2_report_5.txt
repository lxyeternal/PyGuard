  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is straightforward utility functions for retry logic and string cleanup. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The regex patterns are standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report's conclusion aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or security risks are present; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity. The code handles retries and description cleanup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues. The regex is safe, and the logic is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The report assigns a very low security risk, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No external data handling or vulnerabilities; the minimal risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities detected. The functions are utility in nature.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues. The regex patterns are straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report's conclusion is consistent.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues. The code is standard utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9. The report assigns a low risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No external or sensitive data handling.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected or claimed.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, as the code is purely utility functions with no external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided analysis.\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk, such as regex use, but nothing dangerous)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured utility code, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
