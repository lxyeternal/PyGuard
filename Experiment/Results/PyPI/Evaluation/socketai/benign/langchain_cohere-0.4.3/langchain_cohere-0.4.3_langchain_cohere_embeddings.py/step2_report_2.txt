  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues found; standard API wrapper, environment variable handling, retry logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — seems reasonable given the low risk nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious behavior.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions made; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores consistency:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; secure handling of API keys, standard SDK pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the low risk score is justified.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions:** None.\n- **Scores consistency:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; environment validation, retry logic, standard API usage.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just standard API client code.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions:** None.\n- **Scores consistency:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; API key management, API interaction, retry logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** None.\n- **Scores consistency:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; standard SDK pattern, environment variable handling, retry logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, secure handling.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** None.\n- **Scores consistency:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), justified by the standard API wrapper nature; no suspicious code or behavior.\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, given the code's nature, but considering supply chain context, a small buffer is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, secure implementation of a Cohere API client with environment variable handling, retry logic, and no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The low risk scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no changes needed.",
