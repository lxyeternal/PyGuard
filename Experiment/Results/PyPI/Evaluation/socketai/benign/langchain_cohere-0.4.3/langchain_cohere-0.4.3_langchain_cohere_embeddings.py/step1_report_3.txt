  "purpose": "Implementation of a Cohere-based embedding service with retry mechanisms, environment validation, and both synchronous and asynchronous methods for embedding texts and documents.",
  "sources": "Environment variable COHERE_API_KEY, input parameters (texts, model, input_type, etc.), class attributes (model, cohere_api_key, base_url).",
  "sinks": "API client calls (cohere.Client and cohere.AsyncClient.embed), response parsing (dict().get), potential network requests, and retries.",
  "flows": "API key retrieved from environment; validated and used to instantiate API clients; embedding methods call API via retry decorators; responses processed and returned as float lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials found; environment variable used for API key; no suspicious network endpoints or data exfiltration code; no obfuscated logic or hidden code; retry decorators are standard. No unusual code constructs or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for interfacing with Cohere's embedding API, with environment validation for API key retrieval, usage of retry decorators for API robustness, and both sync and async embedding methods. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code patterns detected. The environment variable COHERE_API_KEY is appropriately used for credentials. Response handling is straightforward, converting embeddings to float lists. Overall, the implementation appears standard and secure, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a Cohere embedding client with environment validation, retry logic, and sync/async support. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. The code’s security posture appears safe based on this review.",
