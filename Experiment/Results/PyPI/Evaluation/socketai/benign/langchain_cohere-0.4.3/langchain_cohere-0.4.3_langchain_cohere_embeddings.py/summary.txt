  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a Cohere embedding client with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows standard SDK patterns, manages secrets securely, and includes retry logic. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis."
