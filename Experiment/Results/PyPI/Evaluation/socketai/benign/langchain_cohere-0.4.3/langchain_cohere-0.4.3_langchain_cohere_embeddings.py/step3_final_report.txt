{
  "purpose": "This code implements a wrapper around Cohere's embedding API, handling environment variables, retries, and API interactions securely and straightforwardly.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API key, API call responses from cohere.Client and cohere.AsyncClient",
  "sinks": "API responses processed into float embeddings; no untrusted data sinks or leaks identified",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from environment → client initialization → embed calls → response processing into float lists",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is clear, standard, and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves API keys via environment variables or secrets, initializes official SDK clients, and performs embedding requests with retry logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. Response handling is straightforward, converting embeddings to float lists. The structure follows best practices, and no suspicious patterns or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a Cohere embedding client with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows standard SDK patterns, manages secrets securely, and includes retry logic. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
