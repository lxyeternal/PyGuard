  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper with environment variable handling, client initialization, and API calls. No suspicious activity.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  None apparent. The logic and implementation follow standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, given the context of API interaction)  \n  No changes needed.\n\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Similar to Report 1, the code securely handles API keys, uses standard SDK calls, and includes retry logic.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  None identified.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low)  \n  These are reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No malicious activity, secrets are handled securely, and API interactions are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The implementation is consistent with SDK best practices, with environment validation, retries, and async support.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  None apparent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (still low, given the nature of API calls)  \n  Appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is a standard API client with environment variable management, retry logic, and response handling.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  None evident.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1  \n  Appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The wrapper is well-structured, uses environment variables, and performs standard API calls.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  None detected.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n  Consistent with other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. Given the code is a standard API wrapper, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report. Should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The current scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low risk. Considering the code's purpose, environment handling, and absence of suspicious behaviors, a risk score of **0.1 to 0.2** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (low, due to environment variable handling and API interactions)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code. No supply chain or security concerns are evident from the provided code snippets and reports.",
