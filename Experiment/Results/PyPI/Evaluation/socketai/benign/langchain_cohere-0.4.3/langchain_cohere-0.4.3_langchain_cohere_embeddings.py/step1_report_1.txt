  "purpose": "Implement a wrapper around Cohere's API to generate text embeddings, including synchronous and asynchronous methods, with environment-based configuration and retry logic.",
  "sources": "Environment variable COHERE_API_KEY, class attributes for model, base_url, and other configuration parameters, method parameters for embedding functions.",
  "sinks": "API calls to cohere.Client.embed and cohere.AsyncClient.embed; response handling and data extraction.",
  "flows": "Environment variable COHERE_API_KEY -> Initialization of cohere client; Method calls -> API request -> response processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for API key, standard API call pattern, no suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual data flows or external communications outside API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for Cohere embeddings, handling environment-based API key retrieval, client initialization, and embedding requests with retries. All API interactions are via standard SDK methods, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The API key is securely retrieved from environment variables or secrets management. Retry logic is implemented via decorators, and API responses are processed normally. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is evident. The code appears to follow standard SDK usage patterns and best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an API wrapper with environment variable handling and retry logic. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks based on the provided code. The overall security risk is low.",
