{
  "purpose": "The code defines a document compressor class that uses the Cohere Rerank API to reorder documents based on their relevance to a query.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for the API key, accepts input documents and query, and retrieves API responses from Cohere's rerank endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Returns reranked document metadata and relevance scores; does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "API key retrieved from environment variable → Cohere client instantiated → rerank method called with documents and query → API response processed into document relevance scores → compressed documents returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no hidden or obfuscated code, and no unusual data flows. The code properly uses environment variables for secrets. No suspicious external domains are referenced. All data handling appears standard for a reranking API integration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles document reranking via an external API. It securely retrieves API keys from environment variables, validates inputs, and calls the Cohere API. It does not contain any code that would send data to unknown or malicious endpoints, nor does it perform any suspicious operations like system modifications, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection. Usage of third-party libraries is appropriate, and the logic appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a document reranking client using the Cohere API. It demonstrates proper handling of secrets, input validation, and API communication without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
