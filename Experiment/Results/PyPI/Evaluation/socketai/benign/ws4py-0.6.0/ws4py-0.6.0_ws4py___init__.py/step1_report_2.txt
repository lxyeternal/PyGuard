{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for configuring logging and formatting network address information for a WebSocket server or client.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as file paths and level settings for logging, and accesses local and peer network address attributes from a WebSocket object.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs logs to files or stdout; no direct untrusted data sinks are present in the code, but logs could potentially leak sensitive information if not handled carefully.",
  "flows": "User or system configuration data flows into 'configure_logger' (file path, level), and network address data flows from 'ws.local_address' and 'ws.peer_address' into 'format_addresses'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and functions for logging setup and address formatting, using standard Python logging modules. The constants include a WebSocket key and version, which are typical. The 'configure_logger' function sets up logging handlers based on user parameters, with no external input validation beyond parameter presence. 'format_addresses' retrieves and formats network address info from a WebSocket object. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The code’s structure and content are consistent with typical utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for logging configuration and address formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
