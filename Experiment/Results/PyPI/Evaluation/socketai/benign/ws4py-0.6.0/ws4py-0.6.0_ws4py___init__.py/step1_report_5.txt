{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for configuring logging and formatting WebSocket address information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters such as 'filepath' in 'configure_logger' and WebSocket object attributes 'local_address' and 'peer_address' in 'format_addresses'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the logging handlers that write to files or stdout; however, these are standard logging procedures and do not pose malicious risks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('filepath', WebSocket addresses) into logging handlers or formatting functions, with no untrusted data leading to security-sensitive operations beyond normal logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The code strictly follows typical logging setup and address formatting patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging with configurable handlers for console and file output, based on user parameters, and formats WebSocket addresses for display. The use of logging handlers and address formatting is standard and does not involve untrusted code execution or malicious behavior. There are no suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for logging and address formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs expected functions safely and transparently.",
