{
  "purpose": "Provides logging configuration and address formatting utilities for a WebSocket library.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, such as 'filepath' and 'stdout' flags, and accesses 'ws.local_address' and 'ws.peer_address'.",
  "sinks": "Formats address information; no untrusted data is written to external systems or logs directly; logging handlers are configured based on user input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence logging handlers; address formatting functions process 'ws' object attributes to produce strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; constants like 'WS_KEY' are standard in WebSocket implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard logging setup functions and address formatting routines. It uses common Python logging practices, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The 'WS_KEY' constant is a standard WebSocket accept key, not a secret. The functions do not process untrusted data in a harmful way, nor do they contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward, readable, and adheres to typical patterns for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the presence of the 'WS_KEY' constant, which is standard and not secret. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
