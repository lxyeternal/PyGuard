  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides logging configuration and address formatting for a WebSocket library, with no malicious intent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; logs are controlled by user input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Uses standard Python practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code, safe, and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on constants and functions for address formatting and logging.\n- No suspicious behavior or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights safe handling of WebSocket info and logging.\n- No malicious logic or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar benign utility functions, standard patterns.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the code snippets are obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's nature—utility functions for logging and address formatting—risk scores should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1. The only slight increase to 0.1 in some reports is acceptable, considering the code interacts with user-controlled parameters but does not process untrusted data maliciously.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at or below 0.1, as the code is standard and benign.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the code's benign nature, standard practices, and lack of suspicious behavior. No adjustments are necessary unless future context indicates otherwise.",
