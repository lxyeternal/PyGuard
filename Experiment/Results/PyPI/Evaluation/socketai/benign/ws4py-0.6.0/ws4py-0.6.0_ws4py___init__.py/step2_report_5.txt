  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer concludes that the code is benign, standard, and safe, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward utility functions for logging and address formatting, with no suspicious behavior. The low security risk score reflects minimal concern, primarily due to the presence of constants like `WS_KEY` which are standard in WebSocket implementations.\n- **Verdict:** The scoring seems reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the functions are standard, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** The code handles logging and address formatting safely, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is described as standard, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The same reasoning applies; the code is typical utility code.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk score due to the presence of `WS_KEY`, but it's a static constant used in WebSocket protocols, not a secret or credential.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds the code to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** The code's operations are typical and safe.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code Content:** The code is a typical WebSocket utility module for logging and address formatting.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware=0, which is consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, with minor variations due to the presence of `WS_KEY` (which is standard and not secret).\n- **Confidence:** High across all reports, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code content.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score can stay at 0 or very close to 0, given the benign nature.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0), reflecting the presence of static constants but no real security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign utility module, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scoring aligns well with the code's nature.",
