  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, standard logging and address formatting utilities. No malicious intent, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the potential for logs to leak sensitive info if misused, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Justification:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No concerns.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard constants and functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No issues.\n- **Justification:** The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious behavior, just utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Slightly elevated security risk score due to potential log leakage, but no actual vulnerability.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports; utility functions with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions, payloads, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest assigned is 0.1, which is reasonable considering that logging outputs could leak sensitive info if misconfigured, but no actual vulnerabilities or exploits are present.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The constant `WS_KEY` is a standard WebSocket accept key, not a secret or credential. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.\n- The functions are typical utility code, with no untrusted data processing that could lead to injection or remote code execution.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or external dependencies that could be malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly increase from 0.1 to 0.2 to reflect that logs could leak sensitive info if not properly managed, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's benign nature.",
