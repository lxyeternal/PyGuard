{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for WebSocket handling, including configuration of logging and address formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'ws' object in the format_addresses function; reads 'filepath' parameter in configure_logger function.",
  "sinks": "Formats address information for output; no direct sink of untrusted data to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input 'ws' object → format_addresses function → formatted string; 'filepath' parameter → log handler → file output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles logging setup and address formatting for WebSocket objects. The 'WS_KEY' constant is a static byte string related to WebSocket handshake security but does not show any malicious behavior. The functions use standard logging mechanisms, and the address formatting function safely handles data without executing or transmitting untrusted input. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign utility module for WebSocket server logging and address formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or malicious payloads.",
