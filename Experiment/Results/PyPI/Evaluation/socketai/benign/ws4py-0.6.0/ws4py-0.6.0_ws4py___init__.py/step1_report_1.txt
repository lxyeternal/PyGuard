{
  "purpose": "This code provides logging configuration and address formatting utilities for a WebSocket library, with no direct malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as file path for logs and WebSocket address objects via the 'format_addresses' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities. Logging outputs are controlled by user-provided file paths or standard output, which are generally safe if controlled by the user.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (file path, WebSocket address objects) flow into logging setup and address formatting functions, but no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python libraries and typical patterns for logging and address formatting. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger with optional file and console handlers, using standard logging practices. It includes a constant WS_KEY likely used for WebSocket security headers and a version tuple. The 'format_addresses' function formats local and peer addresses if available, otherwise returns a bound address string. No external data sources, data leaks, or malicious code are detected. The code appears to be safe, well-structured, and typical for a WebSocket utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for WebSocket applications, focusing on logging setup and address formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and safe for inclusion in larger projects.",
