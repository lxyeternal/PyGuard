{
  "purpose": "This code sets up WebSocket-related constants, configures logging, and formats network addresses for display.",
  "sources": "The code reads the global constants WS_KEY and WS_VERSION, and the ws object properties local_address and peer_address.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows to sensitive operations; address formatting only reads ws properties and logs do not send data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond standard WebSocket accept key, no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior. Logging setup is standard; no dangerous code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines constants, a logger configuration function, and an address formatting function. The constants are harmless. The configure_logger function sets up logging handlers, which is standard practice. The format_addresses function formats address info from a websocket object; it only accesses properties and formats strings. There is no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious code segments or obfuscated code. The code is well-structured and follows typical patterns for logging and address formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility code for WebSocket handling and logging configuration, with no signs of malware or security risks. It does not process untrusted input in a harmful way and contains no malicious logic.",
