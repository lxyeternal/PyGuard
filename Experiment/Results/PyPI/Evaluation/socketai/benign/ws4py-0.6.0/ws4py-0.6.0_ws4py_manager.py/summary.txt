  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard WebSocket manager with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The only concern is a minor logical bug in event condition checks, which should be fixed for correctness but does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent."
