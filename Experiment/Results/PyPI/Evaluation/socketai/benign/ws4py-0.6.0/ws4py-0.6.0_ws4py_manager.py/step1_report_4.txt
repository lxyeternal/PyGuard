  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions to manage WebSocket connections using event-driven polling mechanisms (select, epoll, kqueue) in a threaded environment.",
  "sources": "Reads WebSocket socket file descriptors (ws.sock.fileno()), uses select.epoll(), select.epoll(), and select for polling, and accesses WebSocket instances' methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls websocket.opened(), websocket.close(), websocket.terminate(), websocket.send(), and websocket.once().",
  "flows": "WebSocketManager.add() registers websocket and calls opened(); run() polls file descriptors and calls websocket.once(); close_all() and broadcast() invoke websocket.close(), terminate(), or send().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. Exception handling in pollers suppresses IOErrors without logging details. The poller implementations are standard, and no suspicious network activity is evident. The broadcast and close_all methods are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard event-driven WebSocket management system with platform-specific pollers (select, epoll, kqueue). It manages WebSocket lifecycle, polls file descriptors, and handles incoming/outgoing messages. Exception handling is minimal but acceptable; no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are detected. The functions primarily coordinate socket readiness and WebSocket lifecycle operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate WebSocket management module utilizing platform-specific polling mechanisms. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on this code alone. It follows standard practices for asynchronous socket handling and thread safety.",
