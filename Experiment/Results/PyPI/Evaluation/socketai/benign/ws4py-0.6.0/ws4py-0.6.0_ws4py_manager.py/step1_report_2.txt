{
  "purpose": "The code implements a thread-based WebSocket manager that handles multiple WebSocket connections using different polling mechanisms (select, epoll, kqueue). It manages WebSocket lifecycle events and facilitates message broadcasting.",
  "sources": "Reads WebSocket socket file descriptors during polling; reads data from WebSocket instances when their socket is ready; accesses WebSocket attributes such as sock.fileno().",
  "sinks": "Calls WebSocket methods such as open(), close(), send(), terminate(), and once(), which may execute application-defined logic; potential exposure if WebSocket implementations contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "WebSocketManager.add() registers WebSocket socket fd and calls WebSocket.opened(); run() polls for ready descriptors and calls WebSocket.once() to read data; WebSocket.send() used for broadcasting; WebSocket.close() and terminate() for closing connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The polling mechanisms and threading are standard. No use of unsafe eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The exception handling in pollers and broadcast is broad but not malicious. No hidden backdoors or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard WebSocket management system using polling and threading. It handles WebSocket lifecycle events and data transmission responsibly. The exception handling is generic but aims to prevent crashes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, external network leaks, or suspicious code flows. It appears to be a legitimate implementation intended for managing WebSocket connections in an event-driven manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a WebSocket connection manager, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on its content. It uses typical patterns for I/O multiplexing and thread safety. Overall, it poses no apparent supply chain security threat.",
