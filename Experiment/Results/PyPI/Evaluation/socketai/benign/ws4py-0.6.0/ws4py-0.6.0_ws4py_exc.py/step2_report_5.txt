  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines several custom exception classes for WebSocket error handling.\n- The `__all__` list includes duplicate entries such as `'UnsupportedFrameTypeException'` and `'TextFrameEncodingException'`.\n- The `HandshakeError` class has a custom `__str__` method that returns a message, which could be set from untrusted sources if misused, but this is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or external data handling.\n- The duplicate entries in `__all__` are redundant but not harmful.\n- The `HandshakeError`'s `msg` attribute could be set from untrusted input, but this is typical for exception messages and not inherently dangerous.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The main flaw is the **redundant entries in `__all__`**, which could be cleaned up for clarity but do not pose security issues.\n- No other logical or security flaws are detected.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. No obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports are consistent and correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only minor issue is the duplicate entries in `__all__`, which could be improved but are not security concerns.\n- The `HandshakeError`'s message attribute could be set from untrusted data, but this is standard for exception messages and does not elevate risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is straightforward, defining exception classes with no dynamic behavior, no external data handling, and no malicious payloads. The duplicate entries are a minor oversight but do not affect security. The potential for untrusted data to influence exception messages is a standard consideration but does not constitute a security risk in this context.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Remove duplicate entries in `__all__` for clarity.\n- Ensure that if exception messages are set from untrusted sources elsewhere in the application, proper validation is performed.\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the reports' assessments and would assign the same low scores, confirming that this code is safe and benign.",
