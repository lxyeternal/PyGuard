  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket-related errors",
  "sources": "None (no input data or external data reading occurs in this code)",
  "sinks": "None (no data is written or transmitted by this code)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow, as this is only class definitions)",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate entries in __all__ list ('UnsupportedFrameTypeException' and 'TextFrameEncodingException' appear twice); no other unusual code features",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes for WebSocket errors, including an additional custom exception with an overridden __str__ method. The __all__ list contains duplicate entries, which might be an oversight but does not affect functionality or indicate malicious intent. No external input, data handling, or potentially harmful logic present. No suspicious behaviors, code injections, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward set of custom exception classes intended for use in a WebSocket context. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. The duplicate entries in __all__ are benign but suggest minor oversight.",
