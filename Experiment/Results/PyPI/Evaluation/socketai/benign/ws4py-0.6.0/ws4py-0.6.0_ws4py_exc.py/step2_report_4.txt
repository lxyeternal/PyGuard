  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes related to WebSocket handling.\n- The `__all__` list includes duplicate entries, such as `'UnsupportedFrameTypeException'` and `'TextFrameEncodingException'`.\n- The only class with additional logic is `HandshakeError`, which overrides `__str__` to return a message.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, external data, or network operations are present.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and intended for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies the code as defining exception classes, notes duplicate entries in `__all__`, and assesses no malicious intent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is accurate; the only concern is redundancy, not security.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes static class definitions, no external input, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Correctly notes the redundancy but no security concern.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, consistent in identifying the code as benign, with duplicate entries being minor oversights.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same consistent assessment, no malicious activity, just duplicate entries.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and only defines exception classes.\n- The duplicate entries in `__all__` are minor oversights but do not impact security.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.\n- Exception messages are set from potentially untrusted sources only if used externally, but the code itself does not process such data.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0; no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a simple, benign set of exception class definitions with minor redundancies. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The duplicate entries are likely oversight but do not pose a security concern.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the analysis above.",
