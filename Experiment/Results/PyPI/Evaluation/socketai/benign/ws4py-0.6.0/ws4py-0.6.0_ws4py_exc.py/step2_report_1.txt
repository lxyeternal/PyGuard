  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines multiple custom exception classes related to WebSocket protocol handling.\n- Includes a `__all__` list with duplicate entries for some classes.\n- Contains a custom `__str__` method in `HandshakeError`.\n- No dynamic code, external input, network operations, or obfuscation.\n- No malicious payloads or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description: simple class definitions for exceptions.\n- The duplicate entries in `__all__` are redundant but not harmful.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only notable flaw is the redundancy in `__all__`. This is likely an oversight, not malicious.\n- No input validation or sanitization concerns because there are no inputs or data processing.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\nThe reports uniformly agree that the code is benign, with minor oversights regarding the duplicate entries.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score remains at 0.\n- The code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, so obfuscated score is 0.\n- The overall security risk is minimal; the only issue is the duplicate in `__all__`, which does not impact security but suggests minor oversight, keeping the risk score at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions.\n- No evidence supports higher malware, obfuscated, or risk scores.\n- The duplicate entries are minor and do not affect functionality or security.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The only minor issue is the duplicate entries in `__all__`, which is not harmful but could be cleaned up for clarity.",
