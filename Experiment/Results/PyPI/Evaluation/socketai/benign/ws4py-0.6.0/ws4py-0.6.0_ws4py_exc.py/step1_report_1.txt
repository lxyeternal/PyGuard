  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket protocol handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception raising or handling in the module.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of exception messages that could be influenced by untrusted data if exception messages are set from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and string conversion (e.g., str()) which may include untrusted message content.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate entries in __all__ list, such as 'UnsupportedFrameTypeException' and 'TextFrameEncodingException' appearing twice. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes, including a custom __str__ method for HandshakeError that returns a message. The duplicate entries in __all__ are redundant but not malicious. No input sources, external data, or network interactions are present. Exception messages could pose a minor risk if set with untrusted input, but this is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, non-malicious exception class module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for WebSocket protocol handling with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The duplicate entries are a minor anomaly but not harmful.",
