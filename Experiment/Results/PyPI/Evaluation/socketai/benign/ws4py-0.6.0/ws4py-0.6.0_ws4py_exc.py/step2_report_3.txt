  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only defines exception classes for WebSocket handling.\n- The primary anomalies are duplicate entries in the `__all__` list, which are benign and likely oversight.\n- No dynamic code, external input, network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- I concur that the code is not obfuscated and contains no malware.\n\n**Security Risk and Risk Scores:**\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling, the security risk is effectively zero.\n- The reports' risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Exception Messages and Data Flows:**\n- The only potential minor concern is that exception messages or custom messages could be set from untrusted sources, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky in exception class definitions.\n- The custom `__str__` method in `HandshakeError` simply returns a message string; unless that message is set from untrusted data, which is typical, there's no risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static set of exception class definitions for WebSocket error handling.\n- The duplicate entries in `__all__` are minor and do not impact security.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minor oversight but overall benign nature)\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, with only a minor redundancy that does not pose any security threat.",
