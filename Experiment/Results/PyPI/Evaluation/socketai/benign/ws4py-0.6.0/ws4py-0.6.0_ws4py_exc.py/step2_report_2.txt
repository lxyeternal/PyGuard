  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for WebSocket error handling.\n- They note the presence of duplicate entries in the `__all__` list, such as `'UnsupportedFrameTypeException'` and `'TextFrameEncodingException'`, which appear twice.\n- They emphasize that the code is static, with no external input, data flow, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The overall confidence in these assessments is high (mostly 1.0), with one slightly lower at 0.9, but all agree the code is benign.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The duplicate entries in `__all__` are a minor anomaly, likely oversight, but do not introduce security risks or malicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward class definitions, with no dynamic code, no data processing, and no external interactions.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- The only flaw is the redundancy in `__all__`, which is harmless but indicates a lack of meticulousness.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n\n**Scores and their appropriateness:**\n- Malware score: 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Risk score: 0 or very close to it, justified because the code is purely static and non-malicious.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- Exception messages are set from a parameter (`msg`) in `HandshakeError`. If this message is set from untrusted input, it could lead to issues like information leakage or log injection, but this is a standard pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- The reports do not claim any such vulnerability, and given the context, this is a common and acceptable practice.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature: no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, static set of exception class definitions with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior. The only minor issue is the redundant entries in `__all__`, which do not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The duplicate entries are a minor oversight but do not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Confirmed: No malicious or obfuscated code present.  \n- Minor flaw: Duplicate entries in `__all__`, but not harmful.  \n- Overall security risk: None.",
