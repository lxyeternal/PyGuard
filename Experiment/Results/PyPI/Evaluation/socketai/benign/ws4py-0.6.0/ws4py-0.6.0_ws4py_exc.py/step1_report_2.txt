  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; all definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems or data leaks; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "None, as all classes are simple exception definitions with no data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant inclusion of 'UnsupportedFrameTypeException' and 'TextFrameEncodingException' in '__all__', suggesting possible oversight but no malicious intent. No suspicious code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception or a subclass, intended for error handling in WebSocket implementations. The exception classes are straightforward and contain no logic beyond inheritance. The __all__ list repeats some class names unnecessarily but does not pose security concerns. No code injections, malicious behaviors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The redundancies are likely oversight but do not impact security.",
