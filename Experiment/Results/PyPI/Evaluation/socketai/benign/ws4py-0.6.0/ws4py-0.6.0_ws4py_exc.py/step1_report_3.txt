  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for WebSocket protocol handling and error reporting.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; exception messages are stored as strings.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate entries in __all__ list ('UnsupportedFrameTypeException' and 'TextFrameEncodingException' are listed twice), which is unusual but not malicious; no suspicious code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for WebSocket-related errors, inheriting from Exception or a custom base class. The __all__ list specifies public API symbols but contains duplicate entries, which might indicate oversight but not malicious intent. The classes are simple, with minimal or no logic, and do not include any code that could be malicious, such as network operations, data collection, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class definitions for exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The duplicate entries in __all__ are likely a minor oversight. Overall, this code fragment appears benign and safe.",
