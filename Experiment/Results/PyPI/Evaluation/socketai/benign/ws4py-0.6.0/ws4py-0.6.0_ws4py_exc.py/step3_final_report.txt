{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes related to WebSocket protocol handling, primarily for error management and signaling within WebSocket implementations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and the __all__ list, which enumerates the exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; exception messages could potentially be set from external sources, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes, especially HandshakeError with a message; no complex data flow or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate entries in the __all__ list, such as 'UnsupportedFrameTypeException' and 'TextFrameEncodingException', which are redundant but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for WebSocket-related exceptions, with no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation. The duplicate entries in __all__ are minor oversights. The HandshakeError class allows setting a message, which could be from untrusted sources, but this is typical for exception handling. No malicious payloads, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is static and straightforward, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of exception class definitions for WebSocket error handling. The only notable issue is the duplicate entries in __all__, which do not impact security or functionality. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
