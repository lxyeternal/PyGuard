{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'ws4py', extracting version info and filtering modules based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'ws4py/__init__.py' via regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; version info is read from a trusted source within the package.",
  "flows": "Version string flows from the source file to the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that imports necessary modules, defines a custom build class to exclude certain modules for Python 2, extracts version info safely from a source file, and calls setup() with package metadata. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behaviors are detected. The version extraction and module filtering are standard practices. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate safe, conventional packaging practices.",
