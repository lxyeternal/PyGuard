{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'ws4py' Python package, intended to facilitate building, packaging, and distributing the library across multiple Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__version__' variable from 'ws4py/__init__.py' file to extract version info; reads input data from the file system (opening files).",
  "sinks": "None observed that would lead to data leaks or harmful actions; no untrusted data used in insecure commands or network connections.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source file, uses that in package setup. No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected. The code structure and practices appear standard for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup functions: importing modules, overriding a class method to filter modules based on Python version, reading the version string from a source file, and calling 'setup()' with package metadata. No code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation present. It avoids risky behaviors, and dependencies are imported conditionally with fallback options. The only potentially sensitive operation is reading a version string from the source file, which is a standard practice and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for the 'ws4py' package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads source files safely, filters modules based on version, and prepares package metadata. No malware or security concerns detected.",
