{
  "purpose": "The script defines setup configuration for the ws4py Python package, including version extraction, conditional module filtering for Python 2/3 compatibility, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the package's __init__.py file to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup configuration and version extraction are safe.",
  "flows": "Reads __init__.py to extract version, then proceeds with setup process, with no data flowing from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The version extraction uses regex on a known file. No suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup including conditional module filtering based on Python version and version extraction from a file. It overrides a method to exclude certain modules in Python 2. The version string is extracted via regex from the package's __init__.py. All operations are standard for Python packaging and do not involve any untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with safe practices for version extraction and compatibility handling. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
