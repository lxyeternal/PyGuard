{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python WebSocket library, primarily to automate distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from 'ws4py/__init__.py' using regex and file reading operations.",
  "sinks": "The version string is assigned to a variable and used in the setup function; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The version is extracted from the file and passed into the setup configuration; the rest of the code manages module filtering based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code includes standard setup procedures with a custom build class to filter modules based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures, including conditional module filtering for Python 2 vs Python 3, which is common practice. It reads the package version from a source file using regex and file I/O, which is typical for dynamic versioning. No suspicious network operations, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. There are no hidden or malicious code segments, nor does it perform any untrusted data processing beyond standard package metadata extraction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It uses typical patterns for cross-version compatibility and version extraction. The script appears safe and intended solely for package configuration.",
