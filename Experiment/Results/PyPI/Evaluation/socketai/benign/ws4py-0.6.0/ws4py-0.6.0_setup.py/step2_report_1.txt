  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for the 'ws4py' package.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across all reports.\n- The version extraction via regex from the __init__.py file is a common pattern.\n- The custom build class filters modules based on Python version, which is benign.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code is consistent with typical Python packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description. It reads the version from `ws4py/__init__.py` using regex, defines a custom build class to exclude modules for Python 2, and calls `setup()` with appropriate metadata.\n- **Malicious code or malware:** None detected. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent. The code handles version extraction and package configuration safely.\n\n### Scores Review:\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0  \n  - Confidence: 1  \n  - **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero)  \n  - Confidence: 1  \n  - **Assessment:** Slightly overestimating the risk; reading a version string is standard. I would reduce this to 0, as there's no actual security risk.\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  - Same as above, with a risk score of 0.  \n  - **Assessment:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  - Risk: 0  \n  - **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  - Risk: 0  \n  - **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Justification for Scores Higher Than 0.5:\n\n- No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerability justifies a high malware score.\n- The only concern is the potential for reading untrusted data, but in this context, the version string is read from a trusted source within the package source code.\n- Therefore, malware score should be 0, obfuscated 0, and risk score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated code:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard for Python package setup. No suspicious behaviors or security risks are present. The slight elevation of risk in Report 2 appears unwarranted, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a safe, typical setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores should reflect this, with all malware and risk scores set to zero.",
