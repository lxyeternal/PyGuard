{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up and configuring the ws4py Python package, including custom build steps and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads the package's __init__.py file to extract the version string.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or potentially harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from the package file, uses it in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic. The custom build class only filters modules based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, with safe version extraction via regex from a source file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The filtering of modules in the custom build class is benign and for compatibility purposes. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles version extraction and module filtering for compatibility without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
