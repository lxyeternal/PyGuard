{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'ws4py', which handles package configuration, version extraction, and build customization for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads the package's __init__.py file to extract the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "Uses the extracted version string in the setup configuration; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Version string from __init__.py -> setup() function's version parameter.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent. The code performs standard package setup tasks without unusual code patterns or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and optionally includes setuptools for packaging. It defines a custom build class to exclude certain modules for Python 2. The version extraction uses regex on the __init__.py file, which is a common approach. The setup() call uses the extracted version and standard metadata, classifiers, and configuration. There are no suspicious or malicious code behaviors, no network activity, or dynamic code execution observed. The code adheres to typical package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs expected tasks in package configuration and version management without any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
