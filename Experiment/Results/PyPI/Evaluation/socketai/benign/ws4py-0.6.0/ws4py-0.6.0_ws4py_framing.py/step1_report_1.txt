{
  "purpose": "The code implements WebSocket frame construction and parsing according to RFC 6455, handling encoding, masking, and validation of WebSocket frames.",
  "sources": "Reads input bytes during parsing (_parsing method), including untrusted network data, and takes input via parameters like 'body' and 'masking_key' during Frame instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Processes data for frame building and unmasking, and handles network communication indirectly through frame parsing and construction.",
  "flows": "Untrusted network data flows into '_parsing' generator during byte parsing; 'body' and 'masking_key' are used in 'build' and 'mask' methods, which produce byte sequences for network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, and no suspicious code behaviors detected. Code uses standard library functions, proper validation, and clear handling of WebSocket framing. No obfuscated code, no hidden network connections, or data exfiltration routines found.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements WebSocket framing per RFC 6455, including validation of frame headers, payload length, and masking/unmasking operations. It includes thorough input validation, especially for frame size and reserved bits. No code indicates malicious intent such as data leakage, hidden network activity, or sabotage. The masking operation is standard and not suspicious. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of WebSocket frame handling without malicious behavior or security risks. It performs validation and framing operations securely, with no signs of sabotage or malware. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
