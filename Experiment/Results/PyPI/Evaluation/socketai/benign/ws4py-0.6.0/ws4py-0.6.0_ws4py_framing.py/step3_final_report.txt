  "purpose": "Implements WebSocket framing as per RFC 6455, including frame construction, parsing, masking, and validation.",
  "sources": "Bytes received from network, masking key, frame header bytes, payload data",
  "sinks": "Untrusted network input during parsing, payload data after unmasking",
  "flows": "Bytes from network -> parser generator -> validation and extraction -> unmasking -> payload processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard protocol with proper validation",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements WebSocket framing, including header construction, extended payload length handling, masking/unmasking, and validation of reserved bits and opcodes. It uses standard library functions appropriately and performs necessary checks for reserved bits, payload sizes, and masking. The parsing generator manages untrusted data with length checks and proper exception handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The masking function applies XOR with a 4-byte key as per RFC 6455. Overall, the implementation is standard, secure, and adheres to protocol specifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure WebSocket framing implementation with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard handling of untrusted data without known issues.",
