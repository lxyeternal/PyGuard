  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard WebSocket framing implementation, including parsing, building, masking, and unmasking.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flows are evident.\n- The code uses standard library functions (struct pack/unpack) appropriately.\n- The parsing generator is well-structured with validation checks aligned with RFC 6455.\n- The masking/unmasking functions perform XOR with a 4-byte key, as per spec.\n- The input data (bytes from network, body, masking key) are processed securely with size validations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  No, the code appears correct and adheres to RFC 6455. No bugs, no logic errors, no security flaws like buffer overflows or improper validation.\n\n- **Malicious or suspicious behavior:**  \n  None detected. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Validates that the code implements WebSocket framing correctly, with thorough validation, no anomalies, high confidence.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (low risk, standard code)  \n- **Justification:**  \n  The report's confidence is high, and no issues are found. The code is standard and secure.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms correct implementation, no suspicious activity, high confidence.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (slightly lower than Report 1, but acceptable)  \n- **Justification:**  \n  No anomalies, standard protocol implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard WebSocket framing, validated, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (slightly higher, but still low and justified)  \n- **Justification:**  \n  No issues detected, high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard framing, no suspicious behavior, high confidence.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (consistent)  \n- **Justification:**  \n  No anomalies, standard implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, no malicious activity, standard protocol adherence.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2  \n- **Justification:**  \n  No suspicious behaviors, consistent with previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero residual risk due to the complexity of parsing untrusted data. This is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed review and the code's clear adherence to RFC 6455, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (very low, inherent in handling untrusted data but no vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of WebSocket framing.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe overall security posture of this code is very high. The low risk score reflects the inherent challenges of parsing untrusted data, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
