{
  "purpose": "This code implements WebSocket frame encoding and decoding according to RFC 6455, handling framing, masking, and parsing of WebSocket messages.",
  "sources": "Reads input bytes during parsing in the '_parsing' generator, and reads 'body' and 'masking_key' attributes during 'build' method.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'self.body' during 'build' for payload data; applies 'mask' method to 'body' when masking is enabled; reads 'masking_key' for masking/unmasking data.",
  "flows": "Source bytes received in '_parsing' generator -> parsed into frame components -> 'body' unmasked/masked in 'mask' method -> 'build' constructs frame bytes from attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for WebSocket framing; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. Masking logic is standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or external network communication. Exception handling is consistent with protocol requirements.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements WebSocket framing per RFC 6455, including header construction, payload length handling, masking/unmasking, and frame parsing. It performs standard operations with no indications of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscation or hidden backdoors. The code is well-structured for its purpose. It validates frame bits and opcodes properly, avoiding common protocol issues. The masking function uses standard XOR logic. Overall, the implementation appears legitimate for a WebSocket library, with no signs of malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of WebSocket framing and parsing. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. Its purpose is technical and aligned with protocol standards. No security threats or malware indications are present.",
