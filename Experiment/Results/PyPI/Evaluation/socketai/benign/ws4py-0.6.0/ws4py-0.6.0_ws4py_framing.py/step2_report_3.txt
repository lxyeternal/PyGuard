  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code's actual behavior.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard WebSocket framing implementation, including parsing, masking, and validation according to RFC 6455.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are mentioned.\n- The code handles input validation, payload length, masking, and frame construction correctly.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or malicious behaviors are identified in the code. All reports confirm the code is a legitimate WebSocket framing implementation.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, security flaws, or mistakes are noted. The code's validation and handling appear correct.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are 0 in all reports, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk Scores:** The scores are low, consistent with the code's purpose and the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- The code performs validation of reserved bits, opcodes, payload sizes, and masking, which are standard and correct.\n- The masking operation uses XOR with a 4-byte key, which is standard for WebSocket frames.\n- The parsing generator handles extended payload lengths properly, with appropriate length checks.\n- No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — Low, reflecting the code's standard, protocol-compliant nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — the code is a legitimate WebSocket framing implementation with no malicious intent.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — low risk, primarily due to the handling of untrusted network data, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, secure WebSocket framing implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores in the reports are justified and appropriate.",
