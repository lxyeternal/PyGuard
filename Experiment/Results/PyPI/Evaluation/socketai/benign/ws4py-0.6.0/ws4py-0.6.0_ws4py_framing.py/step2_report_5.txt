  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code implements WebSocket framing per RFC 6455, with validation, masking, and parsing. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The logic is standard, and the confidence is high (0.95).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code appears legitimate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms correct implementation, validation, and no malicious behavior. Confidence is 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms standard WebSocket framing, proper validation, and no signs of malicious intent. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard implementation, no suspicious activity. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no anomalies or malicious behavior. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no backdoors, no suspicious data flows. The code strictly implements RFC 6455 framing with proper validation and no obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious code.\n\n### Justification for Final Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious routines.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is transparent and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern but acknowledging the potential for implementation errors in a broader context (though none are evident here).\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented WebSocket framing library with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low risk score is appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and thorough, confirming the code's benign nature. No further escalation or suspicion is warranted based on the provided analysis.",
