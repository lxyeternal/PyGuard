{
  "purpose": "Implementation of WebSocket framing protocol according to RFC 6455, including frame construction, parsing, masking, and unmasking functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the frame's body, masking key, and raw byte streams during parsing. Data is read from internal variables during build and parsing processes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified that process untrusted data for external effects. The code constructs byte sequences for WebSocket frames but does not send or store data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (body, masking key, incoming byte streams) flows into build and parsing functions, producing frame bytes or parsing frame data. No external network or system interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for WebSocket frame handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. Use of struct pack/unpack is appropriate. The parsing generator is well-structured with proper length checks.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements WebSocket framing with validation for reserved bits, opcode ranges, and payload sizes. It handles extended payload lengths and masking as per RFC 6455. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication, are present. The only notable feature is the masking/unmasking, which is standard for WebSocket frames. No suspicious or malicious code segments are detected. The code structure and logic are consistent with legitimate frame processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of WebSocket framing protocol with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It functions solely for framing and parsing WebSocket data frames, with proper validation and no suspicious side effects.",
