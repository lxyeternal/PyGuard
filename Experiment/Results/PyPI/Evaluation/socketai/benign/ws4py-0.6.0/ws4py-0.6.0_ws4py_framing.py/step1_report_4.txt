{
  "purpose": "This code implements WebSocket frame encoding and decoding according to RFC 6455, enabling framing, masking, and parsing of WebSocket messages.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include bytes read from network streams during parsing (_parsing generator) and external input when building frames (body, masking_key).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the build() method output (bytes to be sent over network) and the unmask() method, which manipulates data payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input bytes through parsing generators, where fields such as payload length and masking keys are extracted; then data is optionally masked or unmasked for transmission or reception.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard WebSocket framing with no apparent hardcoded secrets or suspicious control flows. The masking function correctly applies XOR with a 4-byte key. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior is detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The implementation follows RFC 6455 specifications for WebSocket framing, including masking, payload length handling, and control frame validation. It employs generator functions for parsing incoming byte streams, which is standard. The masking/unmasking function correctly XORs data with the masking key, with no signs of malicious manipulation. The code does not perform any network communication itself, nor does it contain code for external data exfiltration or malicious control flow. It appears to be a legitimate WebSocket frame handler without malicious behavior. The code structure and variable usage are consistent with normal WebSocket frame processing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of WebSocket frame encoding and decoding. It does not contain malicious or sabotage behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. No malware or security risks are evident. Overall, it appears safe and focused solely on WebSocket framing functionality.",
