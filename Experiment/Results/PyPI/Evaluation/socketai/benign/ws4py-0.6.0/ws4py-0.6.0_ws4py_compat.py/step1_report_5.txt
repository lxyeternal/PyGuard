{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, mainly to handle differences in URL parsing, string types, and socket connection handling in the ws4py package.",
  "sources": "Reads system version info (sys.version_info), imports URL parsing modules, and defines functions that operate on file objects and strings.",
  "sinks": "Functions 'get_connection' and 'detach_connection' access socket attributes of file objects; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Uses system version info to determine which imports and functions to use, then defines compatibility functions accordingly. These functions are simple wrappers around file object socket attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; code appears to be standard compatibility handling without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and conditionally defines compatibility functions and types. It imports standard libraries based on the version, and provides wrapper functions to access socket connections and detach sockets from file objects. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious data flows, or malicious constructs. The code's structure is straightforward, focusing solely on version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It serves a benign purpose, and no security risks are identified.",
