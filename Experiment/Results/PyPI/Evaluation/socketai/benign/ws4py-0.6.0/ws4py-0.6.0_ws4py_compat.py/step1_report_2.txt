{
  "purpose": "The code provides Python 2 and 3 compatibility functions and type definitions for use with ws4py, facilitating cross-version support.",
  "sources": "Imports sys module, conditional imports of urlsplit, and definitions of functions get_connection and detach_connection.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive functions like get_connection and detach_connection that access or modify socket attributes.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info check → import modules or define functions → usage of get_connection and detach_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; functions are straightforward wrappers or attribute manipulations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility shim, defining types and functions to handle differences between Python 2 and 3. It accesses socket attributes via file objects, which is common in network code. There are no obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behaviors. The conditional logic and function definitions are typical for version compatibility and do not present security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign compatibility layer for supporting Python 2 and 3 with ws4py. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
