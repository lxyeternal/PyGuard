  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and considers the code standard for WebSocket implementations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's nature, these scores seem reasonable. The low risk score accounts for typical WebSocket security considerations, but no evident vulnerabilities are noted.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard practices, benign heartbeat message ('beep'), and no suspicious external activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's apparent benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reinforces the standard, secure design, no malicious behaviors, and benign heartbeat.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard WebSocket server with heartbeat, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; no suspicious activity, standard message flow, benign heartbeat.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The code appears benign.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard WebSocket implementation with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting the inherent risks of WebSocket communication but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard WebSocket security considerations)\n\n**Overall, the scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.**",
