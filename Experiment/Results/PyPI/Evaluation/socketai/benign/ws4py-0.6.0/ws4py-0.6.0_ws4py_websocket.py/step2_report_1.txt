  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical flaws, scoring appropriateness, and potential malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard WebSocket implementation with heartbeat, message handling, and connection management. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are observed.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  These seem reasonable given the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n- **Justification:** The code is well-structured, handles SSL, and manages connection lifecycle properly. No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard WebSocket behavior, benign heartbeat ('beep'), and no suspicious external connections.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  Appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected. The heartbeat message 'beep' is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard WebSocket server/client with heartbeat, message parsing, and connection management. No malicious activity identified.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  Appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** The code performs expected functions, with no suspicious code or network activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard WebSocket server with heartbeat, no malicious indicators.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  Suitable.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues evident.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustment necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports—standard WebSocket handling, benign heartbeat message ('beep'), no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  Valid.\n\n- **Justification:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports reflects a low security risk, which is reasonable given the code's functionality.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n- **My own estimates:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect a benign, standard WebSocket implementation with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code appears to be a typical, secure WebSocket component without malicious or obfuscated elements.",
