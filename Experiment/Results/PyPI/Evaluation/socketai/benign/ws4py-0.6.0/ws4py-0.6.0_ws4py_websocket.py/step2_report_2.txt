  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The report indicates standard WebSocket handling with heartbeat, message processing, SSL detection, and connection management. No suspicious or malicious activity is noted.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  The report correctly notes the absence of obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The logic aligns with typical WebSocket implementations.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — acceptable given the standard nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Score:**  \n  The low score reflects minimal security concern; the code is standard and well-structured.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code appears to be a typical WebSocket server with heartbeat, message handling, and connection lifecycle management.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  The analysis correctly states no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The benign 'beep' message in heartbeat is noted.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Score:**  \n  The low score aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Similar to previous reports, standard WebSocket code with heartbeat and message handling.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  The report correctly identifies no malicious or suspicious behaviors, including no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is a typical WebSocket server with heartbeat, connection management, and message flow.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  The analysis is accurate; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — suitable.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is a standard WebSocket framework with heartbeat, message flow, and connection management.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  The report correctly states no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the readable, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low at 0.2, reflecting standard WebSocket code with no evident security issues.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, due to standard practices and no suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured WebSocket implementation with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation.",
