  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any issues, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements an asyncio-compatible WebSocket handler based on ws4py.\n- It uses standard asyncio constructs (`ensure_future`, coroutines, `yield from`).\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are noted.\n- The code handles network addresses via `get_extra_info`, which is standard.\n- The `received_message()` method in `EchoWebSocket` simply echoes back received messages.\n- The `once()` method raises `NotImplemented()`, which is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Validity\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code appears syntactically correct and aligns with typical asyncio and ws4py usage.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evident vulnerabilities like hardcoded secrets, injection points, or insecure practices.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** Use of deprecated `@asyncio.coroutine` and `yield from` is noted but not malicious; it may be legacy code.\n\n### Specific points of concern or anomalies:\n\n- The `once()` method raises `NotImplemented()`. While unconventional, this isn't malicious—likely a placeholder or intentional design choice.\n- No dynamic code execution, external domain calls, or data leaks are observed.\n- The code relies on standard asyncio patterns and the ws4py library.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis\n\n| Issue | Reported Score | Reasoning | Suggested Adjustment |\n|---------|----------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Malware | 0 | No malicious code or behavior detected | Remain 0 |\n| Obfuscated | 0 | No obfuscation | Remain 0 |\n| Security Risk | 0.2 | Slight concern due to use of deprecated features and `NotImplemented()` in `once()` | Possibly increase to 0.3 if considering potential for misconfiguration, but still low |\n\n### Justification for scores > 0.5\n\n- None of the reports or code snippets indicate any malicious intent, backdoors, or malware.\n- The use of deprecated syntax and unimplemented methods does not elevate the risk to medium or high.\n- The overall design is benign, focusing on WebSocket handling with asyncio.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** (benign, no malicious code)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code, no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** **0.2 to 0.3** (low, mainly due to deprecated patterns and placeholder methods, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, asyncio-compatible WebSocket implementation based on ws4py, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score reflects minor concerns about deprecated syntax and placeholder methods, but these are not security issues per se.\n\n**My final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Adjust the overall security risk to around 0.2–0.3, reflecting minor concerns but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2–0.3\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and suitable for deployment in a supply chain context without concern for malicious activity.",
