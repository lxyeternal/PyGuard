  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard asyncio WebSocket handler with an echo server extension. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor concerns are related to outdated syntax and a placeholder method, but these do not impact security. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal and the code is safe for use."
