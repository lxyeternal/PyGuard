{
  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket handler compatible with asyncio, enabling asynchronous WebSocket communication within an application.",
  "sources": "Reads data from asyncio transport layer (`self.proto.reader.read`) and the `Message` object received in `received_message`.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to `self.proto.writer.write()` in `_write()` and indirectly through `ensure_future()` calls; potential for data injection if untrusted data is sent.",
  "flows": "Input data from `reader.read()` flows into `process()` method; messages from `received_message()` are sent via `send()` which calls `_write()`.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated `@asyncio.coroutine` syntax instead of modern `async def`; reliance on `_asyncio_compat.ensure_future()` indicates compatibility layers. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is evident. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a WebSocket implementation using asyncio, designed for asynchronous operation. It overrides certain methods to integrate with asyncio's protocol and transport system. Data is read from the transport layer and processed via the `process()` method; outgoing data is sent via `_write()`. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of `ensure_future()` suggests scheduling coroutines safely. The `received_message()` method simply echoes messages, which is typical for an echo WebSocket server. No suspicious data leaks, code injection points, or malicious behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign asyncio-based WebSocket handler with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It implements expected asynchronous communication patterns with no unusual or dangerous behaviors.",
