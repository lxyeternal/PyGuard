  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket handler compatible with asyncio, allowing asynchronous WebSocket communication using ws4py library.",
  "sources": "Reads data from asyncio Protocol's transport via proto.reader and proto.writer",
  "sinks": "Writes data to proto.writer and reads data via proto.reader",
  "flows": "Data flows from proto.reader.read() to process() in run(); data is sent via proto.writer.write() in _write() method; data is written and drained in close_connection()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscation present. The code uses standard asyncio patterns. The raise NotImplemented() in once() is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code extends ws4py WebSocket to work with asyncio, using coroutines and transports. It reads from and writes to the underlying transport asynchronously, managing connection lifecycle and message handling. No suspicious external domain connections, no data exfiltration code, no hardcoded secrets, and no code patterns indicating malicious intent. The only unconventional element is raising NotImplemented() in once(), which indicates a placeholder or deliberate omission but not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an asyncio-compatible WebSocket using ws4py, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is focused on asynchronous communication and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
