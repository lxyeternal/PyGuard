{
  "purpose": "Implements an asyncio-compatible WebSocket handler and echo server extension based on ws4py, facilitating WebSocket communication within an asyncio event loop.",
  "sources": "Network address retrieval via get_extra_info; message reception via received_message; data writing via self.proto.writer.write; coroutine scheduling with ensure_future.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted input in a way that leads to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Addresses are obtained from transport info; messages are received and echoed back; coroutines are scheduled for transport operations; no external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The 'once()' method raises NotImplemented() instead of NotImplementedError(), which is unconventional but not malicious; use of deprecated asyncio syntax (@asyncio.coroutine, yield from) noted but not harmful.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard asyncio WebSocket implementation with an echo server extension. It uses common patterns for network address retrieval, message handling, and coroutine scheduling. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are present. The only minor anomalies are the placeholder 'once()' method raising NotImplemented() and the use of deprecated syntax, which do not introduce security risks. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard asyncio WebSocket handler with an echo server extension. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor concerns are related to outdated syntax and a placeholder method, but these do not impact security. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal and the code is safe for use.",
