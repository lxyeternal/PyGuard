{
  "purpose": "Implement an asyncio-compatible WebSocket handler based on ws4py, supporting coroutine-based read/write operations and address retrieval.",
  "sources": "Imports asyncio, ws4py.websocket, ws4py._asyncio_compat, ws4py.messaging; reads transport info via get_extra_info; reads data from reader.read.",
  "sinks": "Data is written via self.proto.writer.write; drain() is called to flush. No direct sinks to untrusted data identified; method calls are standard for asyncio protocols.",
  "flows": "Input data from self.proto.reader.read flows into process() in run(), then possibly triggers send via _write method which writes data to transport.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Use of deprecated @asyncio.coroutine and yield from is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asyncio-compatible WebSocket class wrapping ws4py, with methods for address retrieval, data sending, and running the websocket loop. It uses standard asyncio patterns and ws4py interfaces. No signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward asyncio adaptation of ws4py.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of an asyncio WebSocket wrapper around ws4py. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It performs expected functions for a WebSocket handler using asyncio, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
