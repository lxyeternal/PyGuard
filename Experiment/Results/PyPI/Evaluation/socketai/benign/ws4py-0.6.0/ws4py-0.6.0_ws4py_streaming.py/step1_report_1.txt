{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket byte stream parser that interprets incoming frames and manages WebSocket messages, control frames, and errors.",
  "sources": "Input data is read through the generator-based parser, which receives bytes fed into frame.parser. It also processes frames and controls messages within the stream parser.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can be used to construct messages (TextMessage, BinaryMessage), or to modify control messages such as CloseControlMessage, PingControlMessage, and PongControlMessage. No direct data leaks or external system interactions are observed.",
  "flows": "Bytes fed into the frame parser -> Frame parsing and unmasking -> Message construction or control message handling -> Appending to error or control message lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries, and control flow is consistent with WebSocket protocol handling. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Stream class for handling WebSocket frames and messages, with methods for message creation, parsing incoming bytes via a generator, and managing control frames. It validates UTF-8 data, checks masking, and handles close codes, including error conditions. The logic aligns with standard WebSocket protocol processing and does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. No signs of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are detected. Overall, the code performs expected protocol parsing with proper error handling, and all data handling appears to be within normal bounds.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard WebSocket stream parser that securely processes incoming frames, messages, and control frames. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. Its structure and logic align with typical protocol implementations. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
