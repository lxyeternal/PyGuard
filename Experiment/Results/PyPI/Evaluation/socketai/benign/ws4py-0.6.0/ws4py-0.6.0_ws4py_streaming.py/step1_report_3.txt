{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket stream handler, managing message parsing, control frames, and message state within a WebSocket communication.",
  "sources": "Input bytes fed into the Frame parser within the receiver() generator, such as network stream data or socket data streams.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code does not write data or perform network connections or external system calls. It processes incoming data and produces message objects, errors, and control messages.",
  "flows": "Bytes are received and sent to the Frame parser; parsed frames are interpreted and converted into message objects or errors; control frames like ping, pong, and close are handled and stored in internal lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code present. Usage of imported modules appears standard. No obfuscation or code that performs malicious actions (e.g., network exfiltration, file modification, system commands). The code focuses on protocol compliance and message parsing.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a Stream class that manages WebSocket data streams, parsing incoming bytes into frames, handling control frames, and validating UTF-8 data. It uses standard websocket frame handling, including masking, validation, and error management. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. The only potential security concern might be the handling of untrusted incoming data, but the code performs standard validation and error logging without executing or leaking data externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical WebSocket stream parser implementing standard protocol handling with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It properly manages incoming data, validation, and error states, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
