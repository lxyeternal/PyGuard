  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code is a standard `__init__.py` for a Python package, importing package metadata variables and utility functions/classes from internal modules, then defining `__all__` to specify what symbols are exported. There are no external data inputs, no network communication, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Security implications:**\n\n- The code performs only static imports and symbol exports.\n- No untrusted data is processed.\n- No external communication or environment manipulation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- The code structure is typical and benign.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\nAll reports agree that the code is standard, with no anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks. They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly 0, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Any discrepancies?**\n\n- No, all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a typical, benign package initializer with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across reports.",
