{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing metadata and utility functions/classes, then defining __all__ for symbol exports.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (__version__, _func, _mbstrdecoder)",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, input, or network communication",
  "flows": "Static import of metadata and functions, then exporting symbols via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard package setup code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py file for a Python package, performing static imports of internal modules and defining __all__. It contains no external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The structure and content are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
