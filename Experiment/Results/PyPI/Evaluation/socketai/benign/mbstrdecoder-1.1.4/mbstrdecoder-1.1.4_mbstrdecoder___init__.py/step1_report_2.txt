{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization or module setup script, importing metadata and functions for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal module files (__version__, _func, _mbstrdecoder), which are likely to provide package metadata and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only imports and defines exports, no handling of untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no external data is processed or outputted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard module metadata and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __email__, __license__, __version__) from a local __version__ module. It also imports utility functions and classes (detect_file_encoding, MultiByteStrDecoder) from internal modules. These are then exported via __all__ for external use. No external inputs, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations are performed. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard module initializer, importing and exporting package metadata and utilities without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not process external data, nor does it perform any risky operations. There are no anomalies or indicators of malicious behavior.",
