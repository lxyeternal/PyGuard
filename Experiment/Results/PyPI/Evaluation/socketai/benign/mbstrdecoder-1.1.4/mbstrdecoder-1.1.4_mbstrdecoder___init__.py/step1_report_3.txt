{
  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an initializer or entry point for a Python package, importing metadata and utility functions/classes for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal module files: __version__, _func, and _mbstrdecoder",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or sinks are present in this code",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up package metadata and exports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports package metadata and utility functions/classes, then defines __all__ for exports. It contains only straightforward import statements and a metadata comment. No runtime data handling, user input, or network activity is involved. It is a typical package initialization file, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as a clean, conventional initializer script.",
