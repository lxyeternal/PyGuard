{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package, serving as an __init__.py file that exports metadata and functions/classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal module files (__version__, _func, _mbstrdecoder). No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or data from inputs to outputs, as this code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code follows standard Python package structure without obfuscated or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, etc.) from a version module and a couple of functions/classes from other internal modules. It then defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. No external data, no user input handling, no network communication, and no code execution are present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, indicating no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports internal symbols for external use, following common Python packaging practices.",
