{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initialization script that imports version and author information along with utility functions and classes for string decoding and file encoding detection.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (__version__, _func, _mbstrdecoder). No external or user input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security issues are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The file is solely for module metadata and interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module metadata and imports utility functions and classes. There are no external input, no data processing, no environment variable usage, or network operations. The code structure is standard for Python package modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only imports and exposes symbols for the package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
