{
  "purpose": "This module appears to set up metadata and import specific functions and classes related to file encoding detection and multibyte string decoding, likely as part of a larger library.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal module files (__version__, _func, _mbstrdecoder), which are considered trusted internal code sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication detected.",
  "flows": "The code only imports internal components and defines __all__; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward, focusing on module metadata and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports metadata variables and functions/classes related to file encoding and string decoding from internal modules. It defines the __all__ list to specify public interface symbols. There are no indications of input handling, external data exchange, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard setup code for a Python package module, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initialization with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security concerns. It is a typical component of a Python package’s internal structure.",
