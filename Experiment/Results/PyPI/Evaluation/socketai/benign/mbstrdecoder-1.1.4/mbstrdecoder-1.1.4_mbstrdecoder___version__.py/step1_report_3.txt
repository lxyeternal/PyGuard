{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata such as author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email as constants.",
  "sources": "Literal string assignments for metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__, __version__, __maintainer__, __email__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static literals to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only sets metadata constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing.Final for type hinting, then assigns final constants with static string values representing package metadata. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic operations. The use of Final indicates intent to keep these values immutable. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as metadata declaration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is simple, static, and standard for package info. No vulnerabilities or malware are present.",
