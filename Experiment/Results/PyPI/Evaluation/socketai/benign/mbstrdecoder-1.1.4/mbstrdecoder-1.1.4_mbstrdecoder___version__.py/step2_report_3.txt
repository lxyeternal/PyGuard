  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and only defines package metadata constants.\n- No untrusted data inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external interactions are present.\n- Use of `Final` is consistent with intent to declare immutability.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is simple constant assignments; no issues are present. All reports correctly identify this.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reports' logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. No logical flaws or overstatements are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n  These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**  \n  Since the code is purely static metadata, the risk score of 0 is appropriate. No reason to increase it.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  All assessments correctly avoid assumptions; they identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- **Additional comments:**  \n  No modifications needed. The code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is a typical example of package metadata declaration with no security concerns.",
