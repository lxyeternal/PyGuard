  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their findings, scores, and any inconsistencies or potential issues.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, assigns constants, and involves no dynamic or external data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code is standard for defining package metadata in Python modules.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** Metadata declarations with no malicious intent, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Fully accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward static assignments with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Metadata constants, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Standard static metadata definitions, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely static metadata assignment, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign malware=0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable; no changes needed.\n- The high confidence (1.0) across all reports is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is harmless, and the scores reflect that correctly. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
