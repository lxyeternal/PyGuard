{
  "purpose": "Define and store package metadata such as author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments of string literals to metadata variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only assigns constants and does not process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures detected",
  "analysis": "The code declares metadata variables with fixed string values using Python's 'Final' type hint to indicate immutability. It assigns author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email information. There are no functions, input handling, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward and only contains static metadata assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static metadata variable definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, benign header typically found in Python package modules.",
