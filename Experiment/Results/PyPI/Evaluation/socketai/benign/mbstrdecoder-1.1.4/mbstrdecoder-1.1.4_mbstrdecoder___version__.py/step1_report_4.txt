  "purpose": "Define package metadata such as author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email.",
  "sources": "Module-level variables assigning static string values and formatted strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; all variables are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of defining package metadata constants with no dynamic or external data handling. The metadata appears standard and benign. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent. The usage of Final annotations and string assignments are typical for defining immutable package info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign definition of package metadata with no malicious intent or security issues.",
