  "purpose": "Define package metadata constants such as author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string literals to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks as there are no dynamic or external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static, straightforward constant assignments with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code declares package metadata using static string literals assigned to constants with 'Final' to indicate immutability. There are no dynamic operations, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of this code. No suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks are present. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence (1.0), reflecting the straightforward and harmless nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no malicious or obfuscated content. All reports are accurate, consistent, and correctly assign scores. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
