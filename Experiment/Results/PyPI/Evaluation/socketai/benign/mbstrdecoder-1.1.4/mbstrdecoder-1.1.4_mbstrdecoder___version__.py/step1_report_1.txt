  "sources": "Constant string assignments and metadata declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; metadata is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of assigning static string values to module-level Final variables representing metadata information. There are no data inputs, dynamic code execution, network connections, or sensitive operations. The use of 'Final' indicates these variables are intended to be constants. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata declaration with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is purely informational.",
