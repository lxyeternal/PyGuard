  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe code that assigns static string values to module-level constants representing package metadata.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing.\n- The use of `Final` hints at immutability but does not introduce security concerns.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches all reports: static assignments of package metadata constants.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; it is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws, errors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n### Justifications:\n- Since the code is purely static metadata, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here; the code is standard package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis matches the current assessments and is justified by the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
