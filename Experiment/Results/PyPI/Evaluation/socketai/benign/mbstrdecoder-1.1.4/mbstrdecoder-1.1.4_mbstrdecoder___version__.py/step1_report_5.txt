{
  "purpose": "Define and assign package metadata variables such as author, copyright, license, version, maintainer, and email.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with string literals and formatted strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment of constants without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; usage of Final annotations for constants is standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several module-level constants related to package metadata, using type annotations with Final. These constants are set with static string values, including a formatted string for copyright. No input, no output, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for package metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of static metadata definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is a benign and typical component of a Python package.",
