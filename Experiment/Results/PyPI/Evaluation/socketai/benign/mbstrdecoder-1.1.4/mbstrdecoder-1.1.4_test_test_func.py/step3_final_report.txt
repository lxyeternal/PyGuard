  "purpose": "Unit tests for encoding detection functions, involving temporary file creation and platform-specific FIFO pipe handling.",
  "sources": "File writes with specific encodings, FIFO pipe creation, platform check conditions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks; no network or external system calls",
  "flows": "Data written to files and FIFOs, then passed to detection functions without external influence",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.mkfifo for platform-dependent tests, which is standard for IPC testing, not malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite verifying encoding detection functions. It creates temporary files with specified encodings, skips certain tests on Windows, and uses FIFO pipes for platform-specific behavior. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The FIFO usage is standard for IPC testing and does not indicate malicious intent. No external data leaks, backdoors, or network activity are detected. The code structure and purpose are consistent with legitimate testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe testing suite for encoding detection with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores for malware (0), obfuscation (0), and security risk (0 or near-zero) are appropriate and justified.",
