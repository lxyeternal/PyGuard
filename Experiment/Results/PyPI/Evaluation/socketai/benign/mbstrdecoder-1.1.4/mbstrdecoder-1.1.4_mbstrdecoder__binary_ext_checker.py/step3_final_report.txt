  "purpose": "Utility to check if a filepath has a binary extension from a predefined list.",
  "sources": "Filepath input to os.path.splitext() for extension extraction.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the function only performs a static check without processing untrusted data beyond filename extension.",
  "flows": "Input filepath -> extension extraction -> membership check in static list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static list of extensions, straightforward logic, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list of binary file extensions sourced from a reputable URL. The function is_binary_ext_path() extracts the extension from the filepath and checks if it exists in the list. The implementation is simple, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage. The logic is clear and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code performs a common utility function without security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility for checking binary file extensions. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
