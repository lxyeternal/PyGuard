{
  "purpose": "Defines a list of binary file extensions and provides a function to check if a given filepath has one of these extensions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filepath argument in the function is_binary_ext_path() and accesses its extension via os.path.splitext().",
  "sinks": "The function returns a boolean indicating whether the filepath's extension matches a predefined list; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input filepath -> os.path.splitext() -> check extension against binary_exts list -> return boolean.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code simply performs extension checking based on a predefined list.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a constant list of binary file extensions sourced from a reputable URL, and implements a straightforward function to check file extensions. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The function operates solely on the filename provided, with no external input handling or network activity. The code is clean, well-structured, and purpose-specific without any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for identifying binary file extensions based on a static list. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears entirely safe.",
