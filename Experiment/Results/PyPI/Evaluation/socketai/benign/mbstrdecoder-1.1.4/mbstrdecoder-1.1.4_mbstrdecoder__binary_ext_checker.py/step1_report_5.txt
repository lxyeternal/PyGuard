{
  "purpose": "Define a list of common binary file extensions and provide a function to check if a file path has a binary extension.",
  "sources": "os.path.splitext(filepath) to extract the file extension",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or security impacts identified",
  "flows": "Input filepath is processed to determine if its extension matches a predefined list",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a comprehensive list of binary file extensions, sourced from a public GitHub repository. The function is_binary_ext_path checks whether the file extension (obtained via os.path.splitext) is in the list. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behaviors; it functions solely as a utility to identify binary files based on extension. No dynamic code execution, data handling from untrusted sources, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for file extension checking, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
