{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest test cases for the MultiByteStrDecoder class, verifying string decoding behavior.",
  "sources": "Test data provided directly in parameters, and class initialization with string or bytes input.",
  "sinks": "Assertions compare decoded strings; no data is sent over network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into MultiByteStrDecoder constructor; results are verified via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is purely testing decoding logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and tests various aspects of MultiByteStrDecoder including representation, unicode string extraction, codec detection, candidate selection, encoding, and exception handling. All tests use controlled input data, and no untrusted or external input is processed at runtime. The test cases are straightforward and do not include dynamic code execution or hidden behavior. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or anomalous patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a string decoding class, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It does not handle sensitive data or perform network operations. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
