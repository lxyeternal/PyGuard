  "purpose": "Unit tests for the MultiByteStrDecoder class to verify string decoding, encoding, and representation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Test input data provided as string literals and byte sequences within parameterized tests.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing the decoded output to expected strings; no data is sent to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Test inputs (string/bytes) -> MultiByteStrDecoder constructor -> internal decoding methods -> assertions verifying outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily tests decoding logic; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard suite of pytest unit tests focused on verifying the behavior of the MultiByteStrDecoder class. It tests string decoding, encoding recognition, representation, and exception handling with various input data. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code does not interact with external systems or perform any suspicious operations. The overall structure and content are typical for a test suite.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign test suite for a string decoding class. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code's purpose is solely to verify functionality, with no indications of supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
