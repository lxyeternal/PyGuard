  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python library, including package metadata and requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from __version__.py, reading README.rst, reading requirements files, importing releasecmd module.",
  "sinks": "exec() call to run code from __version__.py, file reads, and dynamic import of releasecmd module.",
  "flows": "Reading files (version, README, requirements) -> executing version file code -> importing releasecmd -> setting up package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from __version__.py; dynamic import of releasecmd without validation; no obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures, reading metadata and requirements from files, executing version info dynamically, and optionally importing a release command class. The exec() call could execute malicious code if __version__.py is compromised, but in typical usage, this file should only contain safe version info. The dynamic import of releasecmd is conditional and only executed if available; no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated code are present. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or other malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of exec() warrants caution if __version__.py is untrusted, but in standard package workflows, this is normal. Overall, no malicious behavior or significant security vulnerabilities are evident.",
