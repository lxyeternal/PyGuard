  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the Python package 'mbstrdecoder', configuring package metadata, dependencies, and optional commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py', README file, requirements files, and optional release command module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Reads files and executes content of '__version__.py' via exec(), then passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on '__version__.py' introduces a potential security risk if the file is compromised; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with standard patterns. The primary concern is executing '__version__.py' via exec(), which could run malicious code if the file is tampered with. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The optional import of 'releasecmd' is handled safely. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2-0.3) are consistent with the code's behavior. The main risk stems from trusting the version file's integrity. Overall, the code is safe in normal circumstances, with a known pattern that warrants file integrity checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor security concern related to executing a local version file via exec(). No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The risk is low but should be mitigated by ensuring the version file is secure and unaltered.",
