{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check if a file is a FIFO, convert encoding names to a standardized format, and detect file encoding using the chardet library.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths from function parameters, uses os.stat and os.path.isfile, reads file contents in detect_file_encoding.",
  "sinks": "Reads file system metadata, reads file contents for encoding detection.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are checked for existence and type, then potentially read for encoding detection via binary reading and chardet detection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. No suspicious network activity or system manipulations present. Use of chardet is typical for encoding detection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file system checks, such as verifying if a path is a FIFO or a regular file, and detects file encoding using the chardet library. The functions handle errors gracefully and do not perform any dangerous operations. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected. The use of external libraries appears legitimate and appropriate for the task. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage in the logic, data handling, or structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for file handling and encoding detection with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles exceptions and does not contain suspicious or malicious behavior.",
