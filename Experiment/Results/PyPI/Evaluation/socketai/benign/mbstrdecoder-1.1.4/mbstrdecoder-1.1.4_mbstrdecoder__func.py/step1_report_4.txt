  "purpose": "Utility functions for file type detection and encoding detection, including checks for FIFO special files, normalizing codec names, and detecting file encoding.",
  "sources": "Reading file metadata with os.stat, checking file existence with os.path.isfile, and reading binary data from files with open().",
  "sinks": "Reading file content for encoding detection; no data writes or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are checked for existence, type, and binary extension; then file content is read for encoding detection using chardet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of chardet for encoding detection is standard. No suspicious network or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file system checks, such as verifying if a file is FIFO or exists, normalizes encoding names, and detects file encoding using a common third-party library (chardet). Error handling is appropriate for I/O operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates this is typical utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with standard file and encoding detection functions. No malicious behavior, no malware signals, and no security risks are evident.",
