{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for file type detection, filename normalization, and encoding detection",
  "sources": "Reading file system metadata (os.stat), file content for encoding detection (open, read), input filename parameter",
  "sinks": "None that directly execute or write untrusted data; file operations are read-only or metadata queries",
  "flows": "Input filename -> Checks for file existence, type, encoding detection -> Returns boolean or string results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution. Use of external library chardet for encoding detection is standard but should be noted.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file system checks, filename normalization, and encoding detection. It uses safe, well-understood functions and external libraries appropriately. No suspicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or system manipulation are present. Error handling is proper, and no malicious intent is evident. The only external dependency, chardet, is commonly used for encoding detection and does not introduce malicious risk. The code does not process untrusted input beyond reading file metadata and content, and it does not execute or evaluate code from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for file and encoding detection with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It operates safely within its scope.",
