  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking FIFO status, normalizing encoding names, and detecting file encoding using chardet.",
  "sources": "os.stat, os.path.isfile, open file reads, is_binary_ext_path (external), detector.feed (chardet)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; functions perform read-only checks and encoding detection",
  "flows": "Input file path -> os.stat / os.path.isfile / open -> chardet detector feed -> detector.result.get(\"encoding\") -> to_codec_name",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward utility functions with proper exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign file attribute checks and encoding detection using standard libraries and chardet. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is appropriate, and external dependencies are common and trusted. The functions do not perform network activity or execute untrusted code. The security implications are minimal, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for file and encoding detection with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
