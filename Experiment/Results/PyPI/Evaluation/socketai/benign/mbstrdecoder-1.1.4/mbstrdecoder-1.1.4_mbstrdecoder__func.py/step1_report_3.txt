  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check if a file is a FIFO, convert encoding names to a standard format, and detect file encoding using chardet.",
  "sources": "Reading file metadata (os.stat), checking file existence and type (os.path.isfile, is_binary_ext_path, is_fifo), reading binary data from files (open, read), input file path parameter.",
  "sinks": "Reading file content in detect_file_encoding, passing data to chardet's UniversalDetector for encoding detection.",
  "flows": "Input file_path -> os.stat or os.path.isfile checks -> open/read in detect_file_encoding -> chardet detector.feed -> detector.result.get('encoding') -> to_codec_name.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of external library 'chardet' appears standard. No malicious behavior or privacy violations evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical file handling operations: checking if a file is FIFO, converting encoding names, and detecting file encoding with chardet. Error handling is appropriate, catching OSError and ValueError. No data leakage or malicious behavior is present. No suspicious code or backdoors are found. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for file type and encoding detection with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely handles files and exceptions without leaking data or executing unsafe operations.",
