  "purpose": "Test module verifying if file paths have binary extensions using faker-generated data.",
  "sources": "faker library generating fake file paths, splitext extracting file extensions.",
  "sinks": "is_binary_ext_path function evaluating file extension to determine binary status.",
  "flows": "faker generates file path -> splitext extracts extension -> is_binary_ext_path checks extension.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with conditional import for faker, standard testing pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign pytest test suite that uses faker to generate file paths and tests extension recognition. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive operations are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal, with scores around 0.1-0.2. Given its testing purpose and lack of vulnerabilities, scores are appropriate. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0 would be more precise, but current scores are acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test module with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing scores are justified; minor adjustment of security risk to 0 is recommended for accuracy.",
