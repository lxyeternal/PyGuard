  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent in assigning low malware and risk scores aligned with benign code. Report 5's suspicion warrants a slight increase in malware and obfuscation scores, but without definitive malicious activity, the current scores are appropriate. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with minor suspicion in incomplete or obfuscated code segments."
