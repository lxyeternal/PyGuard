{
  "purpose": "This module exposes Rust-based Aho-Corasick automaton classes and constants to Python for pattern matching.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .ahocorasick_rs, which is likely a Rust extension module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only exports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only re-exports symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from a Rust extension module (.ahocorasick_rs). It then defines constants for backward compatibility and specifies the public API with __all__. There are no data processing, input handling, or output functions. The code appears to be a simple interface layer exposing Rust functionality to Python without any suspicious logic or code execution pathways. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple interface to Rust-implemented pattern matching classes and constants. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
