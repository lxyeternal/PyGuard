{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python interface exposing classes and constants from a Rust extension module (.ahocorasick_rs) for pattern matching functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the .ahocorasick_rs Rust extension module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle input/output or external data.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes/constants and re-exports them via __all__, with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple interface layer that imports classes and constants from a Rust extension and exposes them for Python use. It contains no data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports agree that the code is benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is purely to serve as a wrapper, and no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. Potential concerns about the underlying Rust extension are outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface exposing Rust classes and constants to Python. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and require no modification.",
