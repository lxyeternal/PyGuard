{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to Rust-based Aho-Corasick automaton implementations for pattern matching in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from the '.ahocorasick_rs' module, which likely reads or initializes Rust-based data structures.",
  "sinks": "Exports of classes and constants that could potentially be used downstream, but no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The module imports classes/constants from the Rust extension and re-exports them, establishing a data flow from Rust code to Python interface, with no evident external input handling or output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. The code is straightforward and primarily involves static imports and re-exports.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes and constants from a Rust extension module and exposes them as part of its public API. It includes backward compatibility constants. There are no functions, input handling, or data processing occurring here. The module appears to serve as an interface layer, not executing any logic or performing I/O operations. The code does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or cryptographic operations. No anomalies or malicious constructs are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface layer exposing Rust-implemented pattern matching classes and constants to Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Its purpose appears to be providing access to Rust functionalities in a Pythonic way.",
