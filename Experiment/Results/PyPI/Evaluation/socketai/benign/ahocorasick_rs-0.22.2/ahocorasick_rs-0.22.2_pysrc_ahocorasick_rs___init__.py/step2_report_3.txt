  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code imports classes and enums from a Rust extension module (`.ahocorasick_rs`).\n- It exposes these classes and constants via `__all__`.\n- It defines constants for backward compatibility.\n- The code is purely an interface layer with no data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears benign and does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- No signs of data leaks, code injection, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The import and export pattern is standard for exposing Rust extensions to Python.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward interface module.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is a simple interface with no data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external interactions, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is transparent and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are implied or detected.\n- The reports do not suggest any indirect malicious activity, such as malicious Rust code in the extension, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**All reports are consistent with this assessment.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- If the Rust extension (`.ahocorasick_rs`) contains malicious code, that would be outside the scope of this Python interface code. But based on this code alone, there is no indication of malicious activity.\n- The interface is standard and does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard interface exposing Rust classes and constants to Python. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
