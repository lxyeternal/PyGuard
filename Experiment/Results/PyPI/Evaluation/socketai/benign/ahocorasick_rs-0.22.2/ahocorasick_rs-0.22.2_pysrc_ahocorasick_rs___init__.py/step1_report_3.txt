{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import and expose Rust-based Aho-Corasick automaton classes and constants for use in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .ahocorasick_rs module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "The module imports classes and constants, making them available for external use; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for exposing Rust extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from a Rust-implemented extension module, likely compiled and linked via Python's extension mechanism. It then assigns some constants for backward compatibility and defines __all__ for module exports. No input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present. No signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code's structure is simple and standard for exposing compiled extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign interface to a Rust extension library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply exposes classes and constants for use elsewhere.",
