{
  "purpose": "This code exposes Rust-based Aho-Corasick automaton classes and constants to Python, providing an interface for pattern matching functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes and enums from the internal Rust extension module (.ahocorasick_rs).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no user input or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports constants and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward interface code with no unusual or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from a Rust extension module, exposing them under the current module namespace. It also defines constants for different match kinds for backwards compatibility. All operations are static and involve no data processing, user input, or external interactions. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module interface exposing Rust-implemented classes and constants to Python. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard interface code with no suspicious or malicious activity.",
