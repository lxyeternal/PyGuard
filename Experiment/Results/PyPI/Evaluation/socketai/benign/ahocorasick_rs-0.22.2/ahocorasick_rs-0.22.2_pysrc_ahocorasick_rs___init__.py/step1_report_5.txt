  "purpose": "Import and expose Rust-implemented Aho-Corasick pattern matching classes and constants for use in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes and constants from a Rust extension module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only defines imports and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; code only establishes namespace exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from a Rust extension module named 'ahocorasick_rs' and re-exports them for external use. It also defines backward compatibility constants that map to existing enum values. There are no input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution or network interactions. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py or module exposing internal components. No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module interface exposing Rust-implemented pattern matching classes and constants to Python. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior based on its content.",
