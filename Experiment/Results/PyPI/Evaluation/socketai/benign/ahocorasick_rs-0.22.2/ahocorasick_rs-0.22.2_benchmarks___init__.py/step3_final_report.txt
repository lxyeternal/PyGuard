  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, input data, network addresses, system commands, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, subprocess calls, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into network or system commands, possibly via dynamic execution or hardcoded addresses.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs/IPs, suspicious modules like 'requests' or 'subprocess', dynamic code execution, obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "Most reports describe benign code with no suspicious patterns, low obfuscation, and no malicious activity, supported by high confidence scores and low risk/malware scores. Report 5 exhibits multiple indicators of malicious intent, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded network addresses, and suspicious modules, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.7), and risk (0.8) scores. The other reports' scores are consistent with their benign descriptions. The overall assessment aligns with the detailed observations, emphasizing caution for report 5 while considering the rest safe.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of code snippets are benign with no malicious activity. Report 5 shows strong signs of obfuscation and malicious behavior, warranting high security concern. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the described patterns. Minor adjustments could be made if further code details clarify or refute the suspicion, but current scores accurately reflect the assessed threat levels.",
