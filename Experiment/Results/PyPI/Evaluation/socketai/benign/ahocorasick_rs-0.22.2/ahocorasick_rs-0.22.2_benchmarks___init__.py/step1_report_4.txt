  "purpose": "This source code appears to perform data processing or computation tasks, likely related to user input or external data handling, though the exact purpose is unclear without detailed comments.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user input (e.g., via input functions or environment variables), external files, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, file writes, or execution of dynamically generated code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment, network) through processing functions to sinks such as system or network outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of obfuscated code or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution or suspicious imports detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input or data from sources such as environment variables or user input. It processes this data and may send output or perform actions based on this data. No signs of malicious code like backdoors, data exfiltration, or system damage are evident. The code structure appears typical, with standard library use and no obfuscated segments. There are no suspicious network connections, credential handling, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with standard data processing logic.",
