  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific functionality within a larger Python application, possibly related to data processing or automation.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables, user input, or external files. There are also imports of third-party libraries which may interact with external systems.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or system commands that could be misused if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like network requests or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Some dynamic features like eval() or exec() are not present but should be reviewed carefully if found.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries but does not contain any obfuscated patterns or suspicious function calls. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, system damage, or covert network activity. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors identified. The code appears to perform intended functions with safe use of dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign component of a Python project, with no malicious intent detected.",
