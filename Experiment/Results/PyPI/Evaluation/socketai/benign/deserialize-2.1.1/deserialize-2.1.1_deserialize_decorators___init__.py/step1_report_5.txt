{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of decorator imports for extending functionality in a serialization/deserialization library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'deserialize.decorators' modules.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions and decorators, not data flows or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of import statements without any execution logic or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements importing various decorators from the 'deserialize.decorators' package. There are no functions, variables, or executable code present that could pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident. Since it is only importing modules, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious payloads. The imports appear to be part of a serialization/deserialization library, which by itself does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import module that loads decorators for a deserialization library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this snippet.",
