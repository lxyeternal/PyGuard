  "purpose": "This code provides import statements for various decorator functions used in a Python library, likely to add or modify functionality within the 'deserialize' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing decorator functions from different modules within the 'deserialize.decorators' package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only imports functions, with no execution or data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible here as the code only contains import statements; no data processing or flows are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for Python import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various decorator functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The imported functions might be used later in the codebase for adding functionality, but based on this fragment alone, no malicious or insecure activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of import statements for decorator functions from a library module. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears safe and normal for a Python project.",
