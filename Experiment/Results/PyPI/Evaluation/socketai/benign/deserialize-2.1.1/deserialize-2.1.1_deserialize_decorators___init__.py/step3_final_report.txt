  "purpose": "Import statements for decorators used to extend or modify deserialization behavior in a Python library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'deserialize.decorators' modules",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling present",
  "flows": "None; only static imports, no data flow or execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions and decorators from the 'deserialize.decorators' package. There are no signs of data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The import statements are standard and do not pose security risks by themselves. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident, and the code appears to be a typical setup for a deserialization library.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign set of import statements from a deserialization library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
