  "purpose": "Provide functions for converting strings between snake case, camel case, and pascal case.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter in functions camel_case() and pascal_case().",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output converted strings; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input string -> conversion functions -> output string; no external or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual language features. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward string manipulation functions to convert between case styles. Both functions utilize standard string methods without external inputs, external data handling, or side effects. The pascal_case() function converts to title case and removes underscores, while camel_case() calls pascal_case() and adjusts the first letter to lowercase. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple, benign string case conversions with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
