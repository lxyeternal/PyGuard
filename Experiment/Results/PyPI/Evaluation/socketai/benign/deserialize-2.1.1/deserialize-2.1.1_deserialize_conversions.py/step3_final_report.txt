  "sources": "Input strings provided to pascal_case() and camel_case() functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions return transformed strings without external effects.",
  "flows": "Input string -> pascal_case() -> string manipulation -> camel_case() -> string manipulation -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string operations, no obfuscation, no external data access.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: pascal_case() converts snake_case to PascalCase by title-casing and removing underscores; camel_case() calls pascal_case() and then lowercases the first character to produce camelCase. Both functions perform simple, deterministic string transformations without external dependencies, network calls, or side effects. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is correct for standard snake_case inputs, with minor limitations on edge cases. The code is benign, utility-oriented, and free of malicious behavior. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No evidence suggests any security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of string case conversions with no security vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
