  "purpose": "Provide functions to convert strings between snake case, camel case, and pascal case.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to camel_case and pascal_case functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions return transformed strings; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed within the functions, with no external data flows or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two string conversion functions: pascal_case and camel_case. pascal_case converts snake case to PascalCase by capitalizing words and removing underscores. camel_case calls pascal_case and then lowercases the first character to produce camelCase. There are no external data sources, network operations, or untrusted input handling beyond standard string processing. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for string formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
