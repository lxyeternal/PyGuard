  "purpose": "Provide functions to convert strings between snake case, camel case, and pascal case.",
  "sources": "Function inputs: 'string' parameter in camel_case and pascal_case functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing converted strings.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' -> pascal_case or directly -> string manipulation -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious code patterns, and no external data sources or sinks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two string transformation functions: 'camel_case' and 'pascal_case'. 'pascal_case' converts a snake case string to PascalCase by capitalizing each word and removing underscores. 'camel_case' calls 'pascal_case' and then converts the first character to lowercase to produce camelCase. The code operates solely on string manipulations without any external input/output, network activity, or side effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The functions are straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs simple string case conversions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and unrelated to supply chain attacks or malicious behavior.",
