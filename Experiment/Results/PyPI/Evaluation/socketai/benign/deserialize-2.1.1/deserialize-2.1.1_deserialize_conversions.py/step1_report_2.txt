  "purpose": "Provide functions to convert strings between snake case, camel case, and pascal case.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'string' received by 'camel_case' and 'pascal_case' functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; functions only manipulate and return string data.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' -> 'pascal_case' -> 'camel_case' -> output; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward string formatting with no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for string case conversions, using simple string methods such as 'title', 'replace', and concatenation. The functions operate only on provided string inputs, without external data sources, environment variables, or network access. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are standard utility routines with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for string case conversions with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
