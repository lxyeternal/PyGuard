  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is straightforward string manipulation functions.\n- No external data access, network activity, or side effects are identified.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The functions perform simple conversions between snake_case, PascalCase, and camelCase.\n\n**Key points:**\n- The code is benign utility code.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their benign assessment.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The last report has a slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still concludes benign behavior.\n- The code does not perform any complex or risky operations.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports is justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- Security risk: 0, no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- Risk score: All are 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a simple utility for string case conversions.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threat in the supply chain context.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed: No issues present.\n- Scores: Correctly assigned as 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No adjustments needed.",
