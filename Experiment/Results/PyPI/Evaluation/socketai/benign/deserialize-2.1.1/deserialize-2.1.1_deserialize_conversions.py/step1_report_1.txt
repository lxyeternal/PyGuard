{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting strings between snake case, camel case, and pascal case formats.",
  "sources": "The functions read the input parameter 'string'.",
  "sinks": "The functions return the transformed string; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed by 'pascal_case' or 'camel_case', returning the converted string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. No external data access or side effects are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple string transformation functions. 'camel_case' calls 'pascal_case' to convert the input string to PascalCase, then adjusts the first character to lowercase for camel case. 'pascal_case' converts the input to title case and removes underscores. The functions perform basic string manipulations without external dependencies, input/output beyond string return, or side effects. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward string formatting utilities with no malicious intent or security risks.",
