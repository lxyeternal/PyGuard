{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use within a larger library, specifically related to deserialization errors.",
  "sources": "The code itself does not read external data; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input, as this is solely a class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and a base DeserializeException. All classes contain docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling or network interactions. The structure is clean, standard, and appears intended for error handling within a deserialization context. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
