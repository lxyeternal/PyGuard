  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving user input or external data; purely class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception classes. No input handling, external data processing, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears standard for defining custom exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. No obfuscated code, no code injection, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves a utility purpose within a larger codebase and does not pose any security risks.",
