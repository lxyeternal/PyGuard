  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; just class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception classes. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code, and no suspicious logic or behavior. The code appears to be a standard and safe exception hierarchy implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves a purely structural purpose within a larger library.",
