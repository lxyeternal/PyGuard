  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to deserialization errors. There are no dynamic behaviors, no data processing, no external interactions, and no code that could be malicious or vulnerable. All reports confirm this.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. They correctly identify that these are simple exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings, serving a utility purpose within a larger codebase. There are no logical flaws or reasoning errors in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. Given the absence of any suspicious behavior, these scores are appropriate.\n\n**4. Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores:**  \nSince the code is purely defining exception classes with no runtime behavior, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports' scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Analysis:**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting that there is no malicious activity or intent in the code.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**  \nAll reports correctly state that the code does not process untrusted data, does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code, and serves a benign purpose. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond what is evident.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \nThe scores are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a deserialization library.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and serves its intended purpose without any security concerns. No further action or warnings are necessary.",
