  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for deserialization error handling within a library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and DeserializeException, with no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static class definitions with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to deserialization errors. It contains no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. The classes inherit from Exception or a subclass, with descriptive docstrings. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The code serves as utility error handling within a larger library. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code, thus posing no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a deserialization context. It poses no security concerns, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is appropriate for its intended utility purpose.",
