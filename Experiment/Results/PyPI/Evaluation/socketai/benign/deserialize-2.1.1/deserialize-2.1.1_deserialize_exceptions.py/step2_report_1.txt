  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines five custom exception classes related to deserialization errors.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The classes inherit straightforwardly from `Exception` or `DeserializeException`.\n   - The code is static, purely class definitions with descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious code constructs, or anomalies.\n   - The code appears to serve a utility purpose within a larger deserialization library.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and straightforward.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The overall confidence is 1, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are correct.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No false positives or overestimations are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - Given the nature of the code, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification**:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- It poses no security concerns, does not handle untrusted data, nor contains any obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are needed. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose within a larger deserialization framework without introducing security risks.",
