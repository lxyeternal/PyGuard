{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a library, specifically related to deserialization processes.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data read operations; solely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists only of class definitions with no runtime behavior or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only exception class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception classes, with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The purpose appears to be purely organizational, aiding error handling in a larger library. No security issues or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of exception class definitions for handling deserialization errors. No malicious intent, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies identified.",
