  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a deserialization library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance hierarchy, with no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines exception classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to deserialization errors. There are no data inputs, no processing logic, and no interaction with external systems. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The structure is straightforward, with inheritance from Python's built-in Exception class. Overall, the code appears to serve a standard purpose in error handling without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple, benign set of custom exception class definitions for a deserialization library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
