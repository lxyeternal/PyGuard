  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: code presence, potential vulnerabilities, malicious indicators, and the appropriateness of the given scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The report states the code is a standard deserialization utility with no malicious intent, relying on class methods and type checks. It notes that dynamic class creation (__new__) and setattr are used, which are common in deserialization routines but could be risky if class implementations are malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — justified, as no malicious behavior is evident. The code does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated parts.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0.2 — slightly elevated, possibly because of dynamic class instantiation, but still low.\n\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9 — high confidence in the assessment.\n\n**Verdict**: The analysis aligns with the code; no issues found. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safety of the code, no network or file operations, and standard deserialization patterns. It notes extensive type handling and exception management.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0 — no significant risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict**: Consistent and reasonable. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: The report describes the code as safe, with standard dynamic class creation and type handling, no network or file operations, and no malicious logic.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — justified.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0.2 — slightly elevated, perhaps due to dynamic features, but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict**: The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, the code is described as safe, with thorough type checks, no external side-effects, and standard deserialization patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0 — no significant risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict**: The analysis aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: The report confirms the code is a standard deserialization utility, with no malicious behavior, no network or file operations, and standard Python features.\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — justified.\n\n- **Security Risk**: 0 — no evidence of risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict**: Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence**: The code is a typical deserialization utility, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n- **Security Risk**: Slightly elevated (0.2) in some reports due to dynamic features, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured deserialization library with no malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk**: 0.2 — minor due to dynamic class creation, but overall low.\n\n**Summary**: The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
