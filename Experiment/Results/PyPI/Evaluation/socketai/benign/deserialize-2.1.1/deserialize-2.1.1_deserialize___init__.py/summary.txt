  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured deserialization utility with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. It operates within expected patterns for such libraries. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.2) are justified. External class trustworthiness is the primary external concern, not the deserialization code itself."
