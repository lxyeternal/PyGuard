  "purpose": "Deserializes data (dicts/lists) into Python objects, supporting custom classes, type hints, and various data types.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources, primarily dicts and lists, accessed via data parameter and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Class instantiation (__new__), attribute setting (setattr), calling class methods like deserialize, raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input into deserialization functions, through type checks, into class constructors or attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network/file operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard deserialization patterns, with dynamic class creation, type validation, and safe attribute assignment. It relies on external class methods and type hints, which are typical. No malicious logic, code injection, or obfuscation present. The use of __new__ and setattr is common in such frameworks, assuming external class trustworthiness. No network or system modifications are performed. The overall structure is clear, with proper exception handling. The potential risk exists if deserialized classes are malicious, but the framework itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured deserialization utility with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. It operates within expected patterns for such libraries. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.2) are justified. External class trustworthiness is the primary external concern, not the deserialization code itself.",
