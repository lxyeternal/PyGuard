{
  "purpose": "This module defines an enumeration for managing raw data storage modes during deserialization in Python objects.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code imports enum and a custom exception class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code defines methods that determine storage modes but do not process untrusted data or involve data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior. The exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum class for storage modes with methods to determine child modes. It includes only standard enum values and a method that raises an exception for unexpected modes. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, with no input handling, network calls, or data processing that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a deserialization library, responsible solely for managing internal state regarding raw data storage modes. There are no malicious or suspicious behaviors identified.",
