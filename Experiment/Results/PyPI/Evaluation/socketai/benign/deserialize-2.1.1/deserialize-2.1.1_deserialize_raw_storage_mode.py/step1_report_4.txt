  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for data storage modes during deserialization, with methods to determine child node behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements, enum class, method within enum class",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a RawStorageMode enum with modes for storing raw data, including NONE, ROOT, and ALL. It provides a method to determine child mode based on the current mode, with clear control flow and exception handling for unexpected modes. The import of exceptions suggests error handling but does not introduce any malicious behavior. No external data input, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and focused solely on configuration logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for managing deserialization data storage modes. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
