  "purpose": "Define enumeration for data storage modes during deserialization with helper method for child mode determination.",
  "sources": "import statements, enum class, method within enum class",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data outputs or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures and logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an enum to manage storage modes during deserialization, providing a method to determine child modes. It includes standard exception handling and clear, non-malicious logic. No user input handling, network operations, or file manipulations are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a straightforward, non-malicious helper class for deserialization configuration. No indicators of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
