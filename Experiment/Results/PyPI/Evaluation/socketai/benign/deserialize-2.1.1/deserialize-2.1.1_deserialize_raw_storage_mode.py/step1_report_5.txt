{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for raw data storage modes in a deserialization module, including logic for determining child node storage modes.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading in the provided code).",
  "sinks": "None (no output, data leak, or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code is primarily definitions and a method for mode transition.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for raw storage modes with a method to determine child modes. No data input/output, network calls, or environment variable usage. The exception handling is straightforward and pertains only to unexpected enum values. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration utility for managing data storage modes during deserialization. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
