{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different raw data storage modes and a method to determine the child mode based on current mode.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; the code defines static enum values and a method.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; method only returns enum values based on internal logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple enum with modes for data storage and a method to determine the child mode. No inputs, outputs, network activity, or data handling are present. The only potential concern is the raising of an exception if an unexpected mode is encountered, but this is standard error handling. No malicious behavior or suspicious logic is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an enum and a method for mode handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
