{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for raw data storage modes during deserialization and provides a method to determine child modes based on the current mode.",
  "sources": "Enum members and the child_mode() method accessing self to determine mode transitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The child_mode() method reads the current enum value and returns a corresponding enum; raises exception on unexpected value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and self-contained with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple enum with three modes and a method to determine the child mode based on the current mode. It contains no external data inputs, network activity, or data processing. The exception handling for unexpected modes is standard. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's logic is clear, and the exception is a typical safeguard. Given the absence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads, the code poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely definitional, and free of security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
