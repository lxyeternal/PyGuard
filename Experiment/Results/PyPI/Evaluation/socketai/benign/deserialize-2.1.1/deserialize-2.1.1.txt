      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured deserialization utility with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. It operates within expected patterns for such libraries. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.2) are justified. External class trustworthiness is the primary external concern, not the deserialization code itself."

The main concern is the potential misuse if untrusted functions are assigned, but this is a typical pattern and not inherently malicious."
