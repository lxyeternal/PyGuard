  "flows": [
    "Input type_value -> Checks if type_value is a typing type -> Uses sys.version_info to decide which attribute or method to access -> Calls functions like typing.get_origin, typing.get_args -> Potentially raises exceptions if type_value is not as expected"
  ],
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily type-checking utility functions. It uses hasattr and attribute checks to determine type origins, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard, well-understood methods to analyze Python typing constructs across different Python versions. It includes version-dependent code paths, attribute checks, and exception raising for invalid types. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are detected. The functions focus on type inspection and are unlikely to be used maliciously. The exception raising is standard for invalid type usage in deserialization contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type inspection utilities with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles version differences carefully and uses safe, standard Python practices. No security risks, malware, or obfuscated code are present.",
