{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for type checking and introspection related to the Python 'typing' module, used mainly for deserialization and runtime type analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (sys, typing, types, deserialize.exceptions), and within functions, it inspects class references and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or code execution. The functions do not execute or evaluate external input directly.",
  "flows": "The functions perform type inspections and raise exceptions if invalid types are encountered, but there is no data flow involving untrusted input reaching critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code performs standard type inspection using Python's typing API with version compatibility checks.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs runtime type checking, mostly inspecting type annotations and origins, with conditional logic based on Python version. No execution of external data or dynamic code is observed. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are evident. The use of exceptions for invalid type cases is standard. The module appears to be a utility for static type analysis, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for type inspection, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It operates within expected parameters for such utilities, with no indication of malicious sabotage or malware.",
