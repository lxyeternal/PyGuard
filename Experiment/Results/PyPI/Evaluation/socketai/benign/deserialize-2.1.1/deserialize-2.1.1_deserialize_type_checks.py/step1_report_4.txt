  "purpose": "Utility functions for inspecting and working with Python typing module types, including checks for union, list, dict, and class variable types, as well as extracting inner types.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; mainly operates on provided type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; functions return boolean flags, type sets, or inner types without executing untrusted code or performing insecure actions.",
  "flows": "Type input is checked for specific characteristics; no flow leads to code execution or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic observed. The code uses version-specific attributes carefully. No unsafe code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions to analyze Python typing annotations, with version-specific handling for compatibility. It performs type checks for typing constructs such as Union, List, Dict, and ClassVar, and extracts inner types accordingly. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, file manipulations, or other side effects. The logic appears straightforward, well-structured, and aligned with common type inspection patterns. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for type introspection, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is used for type analysis in deserialization or similar processes, with no evidence of sabotage or harmful operations.",
