{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking and extraction related to Python's typing module, used for type validation and introspection.",
  "sources": "The entire code primarily reads attributes from imported modules and objects passed as parameters, such as class_reference, type_value, debug_name.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data; code does not perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "The functions process type annotations, extracting origins and arguments, but do not involve external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code anomalies detected. The code contains standard type-checking logic, uses version checks, and straightforward exception raising.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version-dependent type checking and introspection using the typing module, with clear and standard usage patterns. No obfuscated language features or dynamic code execution is present. It raises exceptions for invalid type extraction attempts, which is typical. All operations are limited to type attribute inspections and do not involve any external data or potentially malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for type introspection, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely inspects and manipulates type information internally. The risk score is minimal, and confidence is high.",
