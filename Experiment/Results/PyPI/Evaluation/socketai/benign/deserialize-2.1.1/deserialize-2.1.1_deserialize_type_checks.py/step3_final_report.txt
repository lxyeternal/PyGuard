  "purpose": "Utility functions for runtime type inspection using the typing module, aiding deserialization and type validation.",
  "sources": "Attribute checks (__origin__, __args__, __module__), type comparisons, and version info for type analysis.",
  "sinks": "Exceptions raised on invalid types (DeserializeException, TypeError); no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Type input -> attribute inspection -> conditional logic -> exception or return value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version-aware introspection of typing constructs (Union, List, Dict, ClassVar). It raises exceptions for invalid types and uses attribute checks to determine type categories. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic is standard, with clear structure and purpose, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for type inspection, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
