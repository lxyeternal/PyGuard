  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking and extracting information about Python typing types such as Union, List, Dict, and ClassVar, primarily for use in data deserialization.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily involves type checking and introspection without external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "None; the functions perform type checks and raise exceptions or return type information but do not process untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard Python typing introspection techniques with conditional logic based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type introspection functions that verify and extract type information from Python's typing module. It relies on version-specific checks to handle differences in typing implementation across Python versions. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communication is present. The code performs straightforward type checking and raises exceptions for invalid inputs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage mechanisms. The use of exceptions for invalid types is standard and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for type checking and introspection, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose and does not contain any malicious code or suspicious activities.",
