{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators to add functionality during class construction, specifically for storing and invoking a custom deserialization method.",
  "sources": "The decorator function 'constructed' reads a function parameter, and 'store_constructed' accesses class references. '_call_constructed' reads class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly perform any data output, network communication, or file operations. It only modifies class attributes and calls stored functions.",
  "flows": "The 'constructed' decorator assigns a function to a class attribute. '_call_constructed' checks for the attribute and invokes it if present, passing an instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No use of dynamic code execution, external inputs, or network operations. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to attach a custom function to a class, which can be called later. '_call_constructed' verifies if this function exists and executes it with an instance. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears to serve a structural purpose for serialization/deserialization hooks, common in many libraries. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a simple, harmless decorator pattern for adding and invoking a custom class method during deserialization. There are no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks within this code fragment.",
