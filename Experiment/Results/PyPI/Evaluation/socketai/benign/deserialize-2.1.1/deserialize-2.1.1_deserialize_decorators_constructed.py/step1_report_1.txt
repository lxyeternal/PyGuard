{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and helper functions to attach custom behavior during class construction, likely for serialization/deserialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class references and instances during decorator application and function calls.",
  "sinks": "The code sets an attribute (__deserialize_constructed__) on class references and calls it if present.",
  "flows": "Decorator applies to a function; store_constructed attaches the function to a class; _call_constructed checks for and invokes this function with an instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network or system operations. The decorator mechanism appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'constructed' that assigns a function to a class attribute '__deserialize_constructed__'. The helper '_call_constructed' invokes this stored function if it exists. The pattern suggests use in serialization or deserialization workflows. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. The code structure and functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The purpose appears to be to enable custom class initialization logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of decorators for class behavior modification, likely related to serialization/deserialization. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
