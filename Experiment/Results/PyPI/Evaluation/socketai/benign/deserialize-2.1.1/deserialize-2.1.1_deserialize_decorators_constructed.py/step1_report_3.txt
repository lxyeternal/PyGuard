{
  "purpose": "The code defines decorators for adding functionality to classes, specifically for storing and calling a custom construction method during class instantiation.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading; relies on class references and instances during decoration and invocation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present; no external data leakage or system effects.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks with potential security implications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code simply sets and calls a method attribute on classes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator 'constructed' that attaches a method to a class to be invoked upon construction. The helper function '_call_constructed' checks if the method is set and calls it with an instance. No external input, no data leaks, no malicious logic present. The code appears to be intended for enhancing class behavior during object creation, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a class decorator and callback invocation, with no malicious activity or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign utility for class behavior customization.",
