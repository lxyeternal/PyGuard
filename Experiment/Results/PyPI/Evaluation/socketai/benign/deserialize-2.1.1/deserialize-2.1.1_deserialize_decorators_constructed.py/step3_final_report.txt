{
  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to attach a custom function to a class for deserialization or construction purposes, and a helper to invoke it if present.",
  "sources": "The decorator stores a function in the class attribute '__deserialize_constructed__'; the helper checks for this attribute and calls it with an instance.",
  "sinks": "The stored function could be invoked with an instance, potentially executing malicious code if untrusted, but the code itself does not perform such actions.",
  "flows": "Decorator attaches a function to the class; the helper checks for this attribute and invokes it with an instance if present.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pattern for attaching and invoking a callback during class deserialization. It involves setting a function attribute on a class and later calling it with an instance. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The only potential security concern is if untrusted code supplies malicious functions, which could execute malicious actions when invoked. The pattern itself is common and benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to potential misuse if functions are untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility pattern for attaching and invoking custom deserialization hooks. It contains no malicious activity or security flaws in itself. The main concern is the potential misuse if untrusted functions are assigned, but this is a typical pattern and not inherently malicious.",
