{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators to mark certain class properties to be ignored during deserialization.",
  "sources": "The decorator function ignore(property_name) and the helper function _should_ignore(class_reference, property_name).",
  "sinks": "Potentially in functions that perform deserialization and check for ignore status, but not explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "The ignore decorator modifies class attributes to include a ignore map; _should_ignore reads from this map to determine if a property should be ignored.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The code uses standard Python features without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to mark class properties for ignoring during deserialization by adding entries to a class attribute dictionary. The helper function checks this map to determine if a property should be ignored. No external inputs, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a decorator pattern for serialization/deserialization logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for managing deserialization behavior. There are no indications of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this fragment.",
