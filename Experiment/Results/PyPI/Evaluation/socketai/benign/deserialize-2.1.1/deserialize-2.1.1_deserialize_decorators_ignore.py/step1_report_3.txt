  "purpose": "Provide decorators for marking class properties to be ignored during deserialization.",
  "sources": "No input or external data read; the code operates solely on class references and property names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or effect; the code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the functions modify class attributes or check attribute existence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard Python features. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'ignore' that adds an entry to a class attribute '__deserialize_ignore_map__'. The helper function '_should_ignore' checks this map. Both functions manipulate class metadata without external data inputs or outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be utility functions for serialization logic, with no security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for marking class properties to be ignored during deserialization. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or signs of malware are present.",
