  "purpose": "Decorators for marking class properties to be ignored during deserialization.",
  "sources": "Class attribute '__deserialize_ignore_map__' where property names are stored.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; only class attribute manipulation occurs.",
  "flows": "Decorator adds property name to class attribute; helper checks this attribute to determine ignore status.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'ignore' that adds property names to a class attribute '__deserialize_ignore_map__'. The helper function '_should_ignore' checks this map to determine if a property should be ignored. Both functions operate solely on class attributes without external input, network activity, or sensitive data. The implementation is standard, clear, and intended for managing serialization/deserialization behavior. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the logic is correct and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing deserialization ignore lists. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided code. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The implementation is standard and trustworthy.",
