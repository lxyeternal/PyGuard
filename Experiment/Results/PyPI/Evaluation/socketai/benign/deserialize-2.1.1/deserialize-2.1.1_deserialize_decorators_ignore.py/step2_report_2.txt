  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines a decorator `ignore(property_name)` that adds the property name to a class attribute `__deserialize_ignore_map__`.\n   - The helper function `_should_ignore(class_reference, property_name)` checks if a property is marked to be ignored.\n   - Both operate solely on class attributes, with no external data input, network calls, or sensitive operations.\n   - The code appears to be a utility for managing deserialization behavior, likely used during object reconstruction.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Elements**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward, using standard Python features, and does not perform any external data processing or network activity.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and intended for marking class properties to be ignored during deserialization.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident; the implementation aligns with typical decorator patterns.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, justified as the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions of malicious behavior.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions; the analysis is consistent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's behavior.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Expert Judgment**:\n- The code is a benign utility for marking class properties to be ignored during deserialization.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. There are no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The implementation is standard, clear, and trustworthy.",
