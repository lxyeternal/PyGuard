{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utility functions to mark and check class properties for ignoring during deserialization.",
  "sources": "The decorator function 'ignore' is used to modify class references by adding an attribute; no external input sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The functions access class attributes and dictionaries; no direct data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The 'ignore' decorator modifies class attributes; '_should_ignore' reads these attributes to determine if a property should be ignored.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward without any obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator for marking class properties to be ignored during deserialization, and a helper to check this mark. Both functions operate solely on class objects and their attributes. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present. The structure and logic are standard and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing deserialization behavior. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
