{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for marking class properties to be ignored during deserialization.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions, no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only modifies class attributes and checks for their presence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'ignore' that adds a property to a class's __deserialize_ignore_map__ attribute, indicating that certain properties should be ignored during deserialization. The helper function '_should_ignore' checks if a property is marked to be ignored by inspecting this map. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious side effects are evident. The code appears to be a simple utility for managing deserialization behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for managing class property deserialization ignore lists. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
