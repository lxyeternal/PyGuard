{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions for marking certain class properties to be ignored during deserialization processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes and property names to store and check ignore mappings.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data directly; it modifies class attributes for internal logic.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there is no data flow from untrusted input to critical operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for decorator usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'ignore' that adds property names to a class-specific ignore map, stored as a class attribute. The '_should_ignore' function checks if a property is marked to be ignored based on this map. Both functions operate solely on class attributes and decorators, with no external data handling or network operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of decorators for managing serialization/deserialization behavior. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
