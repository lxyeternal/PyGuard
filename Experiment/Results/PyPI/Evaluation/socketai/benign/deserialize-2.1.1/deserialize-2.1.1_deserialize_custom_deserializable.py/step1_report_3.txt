  "purpose": "Defines a protocol for custom deserialization of objects from any data type.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares a protocol with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing modules and defines a Protocol class with a class method for deserialization. It serves as an interface for objects to implement custom deserialization. There are no input sources, data sinks, or data flows. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
