{
  "purpose": "Defines a Protocol for custom deserialization of objects, enabling classes to implement their own 'deserialize' method.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard typing and protocol features without suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing modules, defines a runtime-checkable Protocol class with a single class method 'deserialize'. This setup is typical for implementing custom deserialization logic, and does not include any dynamic code execution, data transmission, or security-sensitive operations. There are no apparent malicious behaviors or anomalies in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard Protocol definition for custom deserialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
