{
  "purpose": "Defines a protocol for custom deserialization of objects, primarily for use with string case conversions or similar data handling.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; the class method 'deserialize' is intended to accept external input data, but the code does not specify sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform data output, storage, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the method 'deserialize' is a placeholder for user-defined logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; the code is a straightforward protocol definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing utilities and defines a protocol 'CustomDeserializable' with a class method 'deserialize' intended for custom deserialization logic. There are no data sources, sinks, or data flow mechanisms within this snippet. The code appears to be a standard Python protocol setup without any embedded malicious behavior or security risks. It is a minimal and well-structured interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard protocol interface for deserialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
