  "purpose": "Define a protocol interface for classes that implement custom deserialization logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is a protocol declaration with no input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; it only declares an interface for future implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a runtime-checkable Protocol with a class method 'deserialize'. It is minimal, with no embedded secrets, dynamic code, or network activity. It serves as an interface for deserialization, not executing any logic itself. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface for custom deserialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
