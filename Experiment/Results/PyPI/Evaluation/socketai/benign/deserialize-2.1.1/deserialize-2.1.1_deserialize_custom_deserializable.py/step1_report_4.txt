  "purpose": "Define a protocol interface for custom deserialization of objects from any data type.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines a protocol class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for defining a protocol.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing tools and defines a runtime-checkable protocol 'CustomDeserializable' with a class method 'deserialize'. It includes only documentation and an abstract method. No data processing, network activity, or code execution occurs. The structure is typical for protocol definitions and does not exhibit obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious protocol interface for deserialization. There are no suspicious behaviors, no data leaks, and no malicious intent detected.",
