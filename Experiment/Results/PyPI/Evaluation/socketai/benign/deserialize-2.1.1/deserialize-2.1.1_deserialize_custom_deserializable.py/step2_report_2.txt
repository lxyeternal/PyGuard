  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a `CustomDeserializable` protocol with a class method `deserialize`.\n   - It uses `@runtime_checkable` to allow runtime checks.\n   - The code is minimal, purely declarative, with no data sources, sinks, or runtime data flow.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded secrets are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks**:\n   - The code itself is a standard interface definition, which by itself is benign.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - Since it only defines a protocol, it cannot execute any harmful actions without an implementing class.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscation is also 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - I agree with these assessments.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification**:\n   - The reports give a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is purely an interface, with no vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical flaws or suspicious claims are evident.\n   - The purpose and analysis are accurate.\n\n6. **Scores Consistency & Recommendations**:\n   - The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a benign, standard protocol interface for deserialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes**:\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe and does not pose any security threat in its current form.",
