  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a `Protocol` named `CustomDeserializable` with a class method `deserialize`.\n   - It is intended as an interface for classes that implement custom deserialization logic.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard Python typing and protocol features.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The method `deserialize` is a placeholder meant for user-implemented logic, not defined here.\n\n3. **Data Sources, Sinks, and Flows:**\n   - No explicit data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.\n   - No data flow occurs within this code; it merely defines an interface.\n\n4. **Analysis & Reasoning:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a benign protocol interface.\n   - There are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or signs of malicious intent.\n   - The consistent zero malware scores across reports support this.\n\n5. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n6. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - No issues are evident in the code or reports.\n   - The purpose and analysis are consistent and accurate.\n\n7. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - Given the simplicity and clarity, no changes to scores are necessary.\n   - The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign protocol interface for deserialization with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
