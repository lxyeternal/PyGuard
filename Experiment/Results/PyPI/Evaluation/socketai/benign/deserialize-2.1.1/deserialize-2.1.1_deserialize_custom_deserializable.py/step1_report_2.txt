  "purpose": "Defines a Protocol for custom deserialization of objects from arbitrary data types.",
  "sources": "Importing 'Any' from typing; no input data sources present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; code only defines a protocol with a class method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary typing components, defines a runtime-checkable Protocol with a class method for deserialization. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, and no suspicious dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard interface definition for future classes to implement custom deserialization logic. No external calls, network activity, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface definition for custom deserialization, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
