  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines a `Protocol` named `CustomDeserializable` with a class method `deserialize`.\n   - It is a minimal interface meant for other classes to implement custom deserialization logic.\n   - The code imports standard typing modules and uses `@runtime_checkable`, which is common for protocols that might be checked at runtime.\n   - There are no embedded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no data handling within this snippet.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward, standard protocol definition.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No data sources or sinks are present; the code does not perform any I/O or external communication.\n   - The `deserialize` method is an abstract placeholder, with no implementation, so it cannot execute malicious code on its own.\n   - The code does not include any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty that the code is safe.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code only defines an interface, any actual malicious activity would depend on implementations of `deserialize` in other classes.\n   - The reports do not claim or imply any vulnerabilities based on this snippet alone.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the code is purely structural.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign protocol interface for deserialization.\n   - The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n   - There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a minimal, safe interface definition with no malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.",
