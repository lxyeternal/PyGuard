{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utility functions for managing default values in class deserialization, specifically storing and retrieving default mappings for class attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes (__deserialize_defaults_map__) to check or store default mappings.",
  "sinks": "The functions _get_default and _has_default access class attributes, potentially influenced by external class data, but do not perform insecure operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The store_defaults_map decorator modifies class attributes, and _get_default reads from these attributes to retrieve defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, external network operations, or unusual data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python decorator patterns to attach default value mappings to classes. The functions for checking and retrieving defaults operate solely on class attributes. No external input sources, network operations, or insecure coding practices are evident. The purpose is straightforward and typical for deserialization workflows. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain tampering, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a decorator and utility functions for managing default values during deserialization. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or security issues.",
