{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions for managing default values in deserialization classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class attributes and method parameters such as class_reference and key_name.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks, system modifications, or malicious activities.",
  "flows": "The functions manipulate class attributes related to defaults and raise exceptions if defaults are missing; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be standard utility code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to set default values for class attributes related to deserialization. It checks and retrieves these defaults safely and raises appropriate exceptions when defaults are missing. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. There are no external network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for managing defaults in deserialization classes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
