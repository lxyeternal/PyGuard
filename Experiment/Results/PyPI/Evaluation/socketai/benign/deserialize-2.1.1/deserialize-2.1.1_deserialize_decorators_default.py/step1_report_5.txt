  "purpose": "Provide decorators and utility functions for managing default values in deserialization classes.",
  "sources": "Import from deserialize.exceptions, attribute checks and assignments within class_reference objects.",
  "sinks": "Accessing class attributes and raising exceptions; no external data sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data input flows; the functions mainly set and retrieve default mappings on class objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The use of exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators and helper functions for managing default values in deserialization classes. It checks and sets class attributes for default mappings. There is no code that reads external input, communicates over the network, or performs any malicious actions. The exception handling is for expected control flow. No anomalous or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of decorator-based default value management for classes, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
