  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard utility code for managing defaults, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Comments:** The confidence is high (1). The report is accurate; no issues are present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code manages default mappings safely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Comments:** The securityRisk score is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern. This seems reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Comments:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Straightforward default management with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.  \n- **Comments:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but given the code's benign nature, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score=0).\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are accurate (score=0).\n- **Security risk score:** Slight variations (0.1) are acceptable, but generally, the code is safe.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code snippet is straightforward, manages internal class attributes, and raises exceptions appropriately.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, just a cautious acknowledgment of the potential for misconfiguration, but no real risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code. No adjustments needed.",
