  "purpose": "Manage default values for deserialization classes via decorators and helper functions.",
  "sources": "Class attribute '__deserialize_defaults_map__' and decorator parameters (key_name, default_value).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Decorator assigns defaults to class attribute; helper functions read or raise exceptions based on this attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward utility logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to assign default values to class attributes used during deserialization, with helper functions to check for defaults and retrieve them, raising exceptions if absent. It manipulates class attributes safely, with no external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The logic is simple, well-structured, and purpose-specific. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code does not process untrusted input beyond class attribute checks, which are safe. Overall, the code is a benign utility for internal class management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for managing deserialization defaults with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0-0.1). No adjustments are necessary.",
