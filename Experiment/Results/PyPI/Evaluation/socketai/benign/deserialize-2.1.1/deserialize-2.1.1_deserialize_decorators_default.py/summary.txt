  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for managing deserialization defaults with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0-0.1). No adjustments are necessary."
