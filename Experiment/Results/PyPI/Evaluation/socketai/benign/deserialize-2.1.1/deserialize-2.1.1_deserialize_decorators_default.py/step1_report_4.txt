{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utility functions for managing default values associated with class attributes during deserialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes (__deserialize_defaults_map__) and function parameters (key_name, default_value).",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The functions primarily manipulate class attributes and raise exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input data (class references, key names, default values) flow into functions that set or retrieve default mappings. No external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard Python practices, with no obfuscated logic or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or external communications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to assign default values to class attributes via a special attribute (__deserialize_defaults_map__). It includes utility functions to check for defaults and retrieve them, raising exceptions if defaults are missing. The implementation appears straightforward and intended for internal deserialization logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. All operations are confined to class attribute management, with proper exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing default values during deserialization, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended without suspicious behaviors.",
