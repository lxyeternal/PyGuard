{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and helper functions for managing default values in class deserialization processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from class attributes and decorator parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The code only manages internal default mappings.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class attributes via decorator parameters; default values are stored in class attributes; retrieval functions access these defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be straightforward and purpose-driven.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to attach default values to class references by setting an attribute '__deserialize_defaults_map__'. Helper functions check for default existence and retrieve defaults, raising exceptions if defaults are not specified. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It solely manages internal data structures for deserialization defaults.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for managing default values during deserialization. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
