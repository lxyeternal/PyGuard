  "purpose": "Provides address resolution, validation, and socket connection establishment with integrated validation hooks for secure network communication.",
  "sources": "socket.getaddrinfo, socket.socket, validator.hostname_blacklist, validator.is_hostname_allowed, validator.is_addrinfo_allowed, addrvalidator.determine_local_addresses",
  "sinks": "socket.connect, socket.bind, socket.settimeout, socket.close",
  "flows": "getaddrinfo -> fix_addrinfo -> advocate_getaddrinfo -> validating_create_connection -> socket.socket -> socket.connect",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reliance on external validator objects.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DNS resolution, address validation against blacklists, and socket connection with optional validation. It uses typical socket options and exception handling. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and practices align with secure connection management. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured implementation of address validation and socket connection logic. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are evident. The low security risk score is justified, assuming external validators are trustworthy.",
