      "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign Python package configuration file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score of 0.1 are appropriate and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a security-focused test suite designed to validate network access policies and prevent unauthorized connections. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The use of socket patching and validation is standard for security testing, and no malicious payloads or obfuscation are detected."

The main anomaly is the session property always returning None, which is likely a bug or incomplete implementation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign extension of urllib3's PoolManager with a minor unconventional technique involving object identity. There is no malicious activity or security vulnerability. The low risk score of 0.2 is justified, and malware score of 0 is appropriate. The use of id() on 'validator' should be documented but does not pose a security threat."

The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1) due to version assertions, which are standard practice. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues."
