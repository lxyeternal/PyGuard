{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom FuturesSession class extending requests_futures.sessions.FuturesSession and a local Session, managing thread pools and connection pooling for asynchronous HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests_futures.sessions, concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor, and the local .Session module; class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; code does not perform network transmission or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Initialization of thread pool and connection pool settings; setting and getting the session property (which always returns None).",
  "anomalies": "The session property getter always returns None, which is unusual and likely a bug or placeholder; the setter enforces type but does not store the value.",
  "analysis": "The code manages session and thread pool configuration with safeguards to prevent misuse. The unusual session property behavior is a potential bug but does not indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and primarily utility-focused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for HTTP session management with thread pooling. The main anomaly is the session property always returning None, which is likely a bug or incomplete implementation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
