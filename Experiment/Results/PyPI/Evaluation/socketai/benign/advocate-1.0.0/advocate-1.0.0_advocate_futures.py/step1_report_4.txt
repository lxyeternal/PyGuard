{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom session class for asynchronous HTTP requests using the requests_futures library, extending existing session functionality with thread pool management.",
  "sources": "Imports requests_futures.sessions, ThreadPoolExecutor, and DEFAULT_POOLSIZE; uses a local import of Session; reads max_workers parameter and environment variables indirectly through library defaults.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found; no untrusted data outputs or external communications are directly implemented.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes thread pool and session attributes; property setter restricts assignment to session property; no external data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "The session property always returns None, which is unusual and may prevent normal session access or modification; no use of environment variables, credentials, or dynamic code execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom FuturesSession class inheriting from requests_futures.sessions.FuturesSession and a local Session class. It manages thread pool size and connection pooling based on max_workers. The session property is overridden to always return None, and its setter restricts assignment to Session objects only, raising NotImplementedError otherwise. No input validation, no external data outputs, and no dynamic code execution are present. The design is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The always-None session property might hinder intended functionality but does not suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign extension of an HTTP session management class, primarily concerned with threading and connection pooling. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident, and there are no indications of supply chain attacks or malware.",
