{
  "purpose": "Define a custom FuturesSession class that extends requests_futures and a local Session class, configuring thread pools and connection adapters.",
  "sources": "Imports requests_futures.sessions, concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor, requests.adapters.DEFAULT_POOLSIZE, and a local Session module. Reads from constructor parameters and class properties.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits data; it mainly sets up session configurations and properties.",
  "flows": "Constructor uses parameters to configure adapter kwargs and initializes the parent Session. The session property getter always returns None; the setter enforces type constraints.",
  "anomalies": "The session property getter returning None regardless of internal state is unusual. No actual network requests or data handling are present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No suspicious imports beyond standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class extending requests_futures.sessions.FuturesSession and a custom Session. It sets up thread pooling based on max_workers and configures connection pooling if max_workers exceeds the default pool size. The session property is overridden to always return None, which is unusual but not malicious. The setter enforces type safety, preventing misuse. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to focus on thread and connection management for HTTP sessions, with no indication of malicious intent or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard session wrapper with an unusual session property implementation but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
