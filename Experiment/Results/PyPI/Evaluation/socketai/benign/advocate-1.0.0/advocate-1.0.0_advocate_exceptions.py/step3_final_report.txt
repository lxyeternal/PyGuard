  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error conditions in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance does not involve data processing or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual multiple inheritance in ProxyDisabledException, but syntactically valid and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. The only notable aspect is multiple inheritance in ProxyDisabledException, which is syntactically valid but uncommon. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard patterns indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. It defines custom exception classes without any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0.",
