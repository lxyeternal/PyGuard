  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims and scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code defines exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, with no dynamic behavior, I/O, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to report 1, with an additional note on multiple inheritance, which is syntactically valid but unusual.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Still benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern, straightforward exception class definitions, no external data or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, minimal, standard exception class definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only class definitions for exceptions.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.\n- **Security risk:** Zero in all cases, as expected.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate given the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The use of multiple inheritance in `ProxyDisabledException` is unusual but not malicious.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's benign nature.",
