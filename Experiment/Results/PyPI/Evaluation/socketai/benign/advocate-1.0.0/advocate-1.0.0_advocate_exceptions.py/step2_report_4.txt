  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code only defines exception classes, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also confirms straightforward exception class definitions, noting the multiple inheritance as unusual but not malicious.\n- Malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- No logical flaws.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar conclusion: safe, standard exception classes, no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that the code is purely class definitions, benign, with no security issues.\n- Malware score is 0, matching the analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: benign exception class definitions, no malicious activity.\n- Malware score is 0.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as expected.\n- The security risk scores are 0, matching the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues found; the scores are appropriate.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk should remain at 0.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's nature. The code is benign, straightforward, and serves purely as a set of custom exception classes.",
