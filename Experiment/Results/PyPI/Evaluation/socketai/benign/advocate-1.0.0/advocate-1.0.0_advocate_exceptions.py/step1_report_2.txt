  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple inheritance in ProxyDisabledException; no apparent malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from built-in exceptions or other custom exceptions. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or data transmission mechanisms. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining error types. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The multiple inheritance in ProxyDisabledException is syntactically valid but unusual; however, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining custom exceptions without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe, and intended for error handling within a larger codebase.",
