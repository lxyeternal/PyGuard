  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No. The code only defines exception classes.  \n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** None. The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risk. The high confidence score (1) is justified.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No. The code only defines exceptions, with no runtime behavior.  \n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** No. The mention of multiple inheritance is noted but not suspicious.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The reasoning is valid.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No. Static class definitions only.  \n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or security issues.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No.  \n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** Standard exception class definitions, safe and benign.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present in code?** No.  \n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious patterns.  \n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis. Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there's no basis for higher risk or malware scores. The confidence levels are high, which is justified.  \n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, standard, and contains no security issues.",
