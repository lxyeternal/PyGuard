  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as there are no data inputs or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception and NotImplementedError. These classes are likely intended to be used elsewhere in the application for error handling. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls. The structure is straightforward and standard for exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code is minimal and focused on error class declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as a definition of custom exceptions. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks within this code. It appears to be a safe, standard pattern for error management.",
