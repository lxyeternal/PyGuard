  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error conditions related to advocacy, address handling, nameservers, mounting, and proxy issues.",
  "sources": "No external data input, environment variables, or untrusted sources; all data are class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; purely static class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The exception classes are straightforward and typical in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. No input reading, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations present. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious logic observed. The class hierarchy is standard for exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of standard exception class declarations for error handling purposes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies identified.",
