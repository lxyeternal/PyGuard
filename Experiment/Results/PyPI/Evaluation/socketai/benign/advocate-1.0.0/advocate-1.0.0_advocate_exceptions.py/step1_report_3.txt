  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Python application to handle various error conditions related to advocacy, network, or proxy issues.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted data sources; class definitions are static and hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; no code execution or data handling occurs in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; the code only defines classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The class inheritance appears standard and intended for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception or NotImplementedError. These classes are straightforward, serving to categorize specific error types. No external inputs, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The inheritance structure is normal, and no suspicious patterns or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for error handling purposes.",
