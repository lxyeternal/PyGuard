  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error conditions related to advocacy or network issues.",
  "sources": "None (no input data reading or external data sources involved).",
  "sinks": "None (no output, data leaks, or external interactions).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is class definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception classes, such as Exception and NotImplementedError. All classes are straightforward and follow Python conventions for creating custom exceptions. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for defining exception hierarchies. There is no sign of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns. The code appears to serve purely as part of a larger application’s error handling mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely defines exception classes without any malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard, straightforward implementation with no signs of malware or security risks.",
