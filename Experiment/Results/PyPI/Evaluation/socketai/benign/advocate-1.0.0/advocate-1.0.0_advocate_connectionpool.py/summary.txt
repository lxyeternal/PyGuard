  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard extension of urllib3 connection pools with validation classes. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1) due to version assertions, which are standard practice. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues."
