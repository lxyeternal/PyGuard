  "purpose": "Define custom connection pool classes for HTTP and HTTPS using validated connection classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'requests.packages.urllib3' and local '.connection' module, attribute assertions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data or potential leaks.",
  "flows": "Import and assertion statements set up class definitions that use imported modules and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Use of assertions as version guards is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific connection pool classes from urllib3, verifies their attributes to ensure compatibility, and defines subclasses that specify custom connection classes for HTTP and HTTPS. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The assertions are safety checks to prevent silent failures due to API changes. Overall, this code appears to be a typical extension of a third-party library with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code cleanly extends urllib3 connection pools with custom connection classes, performing version guard assertions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
