  "purpose": "Define custom HTTP and HTTPS connection pools that use validation connection classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for urllib3 connection pools and local connection classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Import of connection pool classes -> assertion checks -> class definitions overriding ConnectionCls and scheme.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports connection pool classes from urllib3 and asserts the presence of specific attributes to ensure compatibility. It then defines subclasses that specify custom connection classes and schemes for HTTP and HTTPS. The code appears to be part of a configuration or extension to urllib3, possibly for adding validation or security features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The structure is straightforward, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of urllib3 connection pools with custom connection classes for validation purposes. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a safe and purposeful module for customizing connection handling.",
