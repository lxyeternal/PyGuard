{
  "purpose": "Define custom connection pool classes for HTTP and HTTPS that utilize validating connection classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests.packages.urllib3 and local connection modules.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; the code primarily sets class attributes and checks for attributes.",
  "flows": "Import statements → Attribute assertions → Class definitions with attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. The code is straightforward and relies on standard libraries and local classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports connection pool classes from urllib3 via requests, asserts the presence of certain attributes to ensure compatibility, and defines subclasses with custom connection classes for HTTP and HTTPS. No input reading, data leaks, or external communications are present. The code appears to extend existing classes with custom connection handling, likely for validation purposes, without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard extension of urllib3 connection pools with custom validation connections. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. It is a benign component of a larger HTTP client setup.",
