  "purpose": "Import statements for handling HTTP requests, exceptions, and custom modules for address validation and adapters.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'requests' library and local modules (.adapters, .api, .addrvalidator, .exceptions). No input reading or data input points shown.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present in these import statements alone.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable at this stage since only imports are shown; no data processing or untrusted data handling is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident; code appears to be standard import setup.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports modules and classes necessary for HTTP request handling and custom validation. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The presence of various request-related classes suggests this code is used for making HTTP requests, but no malicious behavior is evident from import statements alone. No network activity or data processing is visible here, so no malicious behavior or security risks can be inferred from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements setting up HTTP handling and custom modules. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are apparent at this stage.",
