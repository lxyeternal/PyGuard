  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports focus solely on import statements, version declaration, and module setup.\n- No execution, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or code injection are identified.\n- The code snippets are standard for setting up an HTTP client or API wrapper with address validation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is benign, primarily involving imports from the 'requests' library and local modules.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal or no risk based on this snippet.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The reported issues are not present; the code does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or anomalies.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the content.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 0.9 or 1) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code snippet is a standard import/setup block with no malicious or security concern.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, as no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero, reflecting negligible risk)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's benign intent and safety.",
