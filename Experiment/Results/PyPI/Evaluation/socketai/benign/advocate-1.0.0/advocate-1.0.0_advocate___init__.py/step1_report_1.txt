  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and classes from the 'requests' library and local modules for HTTP request handling and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'requests' library (utils, models, status_codes, exceptions), local modules (.adapters, .api, .addrvalidator, .exceptions).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flow targets; no network calls or data outputs are directly made in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this code snippet; it's mainly import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard import statements without any suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard import section, pulling in modules and classes for handling HTTP requests and local validation logic. No execution, dynamic code, or data processing is present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup for a module that handles HTTP requests and address validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
