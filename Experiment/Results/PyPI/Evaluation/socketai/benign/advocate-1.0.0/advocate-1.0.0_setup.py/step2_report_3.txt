  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward setup script; reads version and README; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, given it's a standard setup script).\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup operations, no suspicious logic, no external code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard package setup, safe file reads, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup; no suspicious code or data flows.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code performs only static file reads and configuration, with no network, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; regex for version extraction is standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the code is a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, due to the nature of setup scripts; some may argue slightly higher, but generally negligible)\n\n**Note:** These scores reflect the absence of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The current scores are appropriate; I would keep malware and obfuscated at 0, and risk at 0.1.",
