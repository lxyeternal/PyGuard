  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same setup script, which is a standard Python package configuration.\n- No suspicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation is mentioned.\n- The code reads version info from a source file and README content, then calls setuptools.setup() with typical parameters.\n- No external data flows, network calls, or untrusted inputs are involved.\n- The dependencies are common and benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or backdoors are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, performs standard setup operations, and no issues are detected.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports indicate any malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** The setup script appears benign; no security vulnerabilities or supply chain risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The only minor note is that `tests_require` is deprecated in favor of `extras_require`, but this is not a security concern.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the setup context but not indicating any real threat.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The malware score of **0** is justified because there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of **0** is justified due to straightforward code.\n- The security risk score of **0.1** is acceptable, reflecting minimal inherent risk in a standard setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the script as benign.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal inherent risk in package setup, but no actual threat)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe setup script is a standard, safe, and legitimate package configuration file with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The overall security posture of this setup script is very low risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Accept the reports as accurate; no further action required.",
