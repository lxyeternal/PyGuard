  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'advocate/__init__.py' via regex; reads README content from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or system calls; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads version and README files, then passes data to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing static file reads and calling setuptools.setup() with predefined parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The dependencies are common, and the version extraction uses a standard regex pattern. The script is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The code's structure and content are consistent with benign package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign Python package configuration file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score of 0.1 are appropriate and justified.",
