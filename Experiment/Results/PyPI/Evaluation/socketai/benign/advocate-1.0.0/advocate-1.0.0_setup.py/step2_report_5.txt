  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard Python setup script.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code reads static files and passes data to setuptools.setup() without untrusted input or unsafe operations.\n- The version extraction via regex from __init__.py is typical.\n- No network activity, external command execution, or data leaks are evident.\n- The dependencies listed are common and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Setup script, reads version and README.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; straightforward setup.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, due to general package setup)\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n### **Issue 2**\n- Same as above, consistent analysis.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n### **Issue 3**\n- Similar setup, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n### **Issue 4**\n- Same pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n### **Issue 5**\n- Again, a typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All zero, as no malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), since this is a standard package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**Note:** The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, which is reasonable for a setup script that does not perform any dangerous operations but still involves reading files and configuring dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting minimal but inherent risk in package setup scripts.\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and poses no supply chain security threat.**",
