{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'advocate', including dependencies, metadata, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading 'advocate/__init__.py' to extract version, reading 'README.rst' for long description, importing modules for setup.",
  "sinks": "No clear untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands present.",
  "flows": "Reading version from source file; loading readme; passing data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version is common; no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. The code reads files and configures package info normally.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the version from a source file using regex, loads the README content, and calls setuptools.setup() with package info and dependencies. All actions are standard for package setup. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No data leaks, network communications, or code injections are present. Use of standard modules and straightforward logic suggests this is a legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
