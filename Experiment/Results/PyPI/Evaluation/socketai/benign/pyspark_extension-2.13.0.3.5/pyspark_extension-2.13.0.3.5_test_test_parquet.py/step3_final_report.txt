  "purpose": "Unit tests for Spark's Parquet reading functions, verifying metadata, schema, blocks, columns, and partitions using a local test file.",
  "sources": "Reads from a static local file path for the test.parquet file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; only local file reads and assertions.",
  "flows": "Spark read functions process the local test file; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic input; straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for Spark's parquet functions, utilizing static local files and performing assertions on expected counts. It contains no malicious payloads, no external data handling, and no obfuscation. The static file path is typical for tests and does not introduce security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The code's purpose is purely to verify functionality in a controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for Spark's parquet reading capabilities. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
