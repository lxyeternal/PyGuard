  "purpose": "Unit tests for Spark-based Parquet file metadata, schema, blocks, columns, and partitions reading functionalities.",
  "sources": "Path to test.parquet file, methods of spark.read that read metadata, schema, blocks, columns, and partitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Reading local Parquet file path -> invoking Spark read methods -> retrieving data/metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. Use of local file path is standard for tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for a Spark application handling Parquet files. It loads a local test file and performs various assertions on metadata, schema, blocks, columns, and partitions. The code does not include any input/output that could lead to code injection or data leakage. No network communication, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The usage of a local file for testing is typical and safe. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward unit testing script for a Spark application interacting with Parquet files. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
