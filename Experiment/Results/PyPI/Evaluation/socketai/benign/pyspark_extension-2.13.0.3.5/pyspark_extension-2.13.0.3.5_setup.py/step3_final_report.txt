{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, defining package metadata, dependencies, and package data without executing any untrusted code or performing network operations.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file, static version variables, and package data references to JAR files with predictable naming conventions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data from version variables and package data references used directly in setup(), with no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows typical packaging practices and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md, defines static version variables, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and package data. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, code execution, or obfuscation. Package data references JAR files with predictable naming conventions, typical for Spark extensions. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, adheres to standard practices, and lacks any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
