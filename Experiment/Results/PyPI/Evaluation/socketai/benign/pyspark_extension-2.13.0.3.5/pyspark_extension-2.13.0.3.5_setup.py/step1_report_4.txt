{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package providing extensions to Apache Spark, mainly for packaging and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, defining version variables, setting package metadata, and specifying package data including JAR files.",
  "sinks": "None of the code includes untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for long_description -> Setting package metadata and configuration -> Including specific JAR files based on version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The package data path includes a pattern for JAR files with version-specific naming, which appears standard for distributing dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README.md file to set long_description, defines version variables for Spark and Scala compatibility, and uses setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and included data files. The use of Path to read a local file is standard. No dynamic code execution, environment variable misuse, or malicious code is present. The package data includes JAR files matching version patterns, typical for Spark-related packages. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard packaging practices without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly handles package metadata, dependencies, and data inclusion without executing untrusted code or performing harmful operations.",
