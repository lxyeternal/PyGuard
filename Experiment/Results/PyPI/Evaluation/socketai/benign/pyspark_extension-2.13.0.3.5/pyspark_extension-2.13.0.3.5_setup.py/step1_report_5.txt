{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyspark-extension', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing setup from setuptools, and defining variables for versioning.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted external inputs or outputs. No sinks perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README.md file content, processes version strings, and calls setup() with the provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a local README file, constructs version strings, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and data files. No user input handling, network connections, or execution of untrusted code occurs. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and distribution parameters.",
