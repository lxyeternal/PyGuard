  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads the README.md file for long description.\n- It defines version strings statically.\n- It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package data, including JAR files with predictable naming conventions.\n- No dynamic or untrusted input sources, network operations, or code execution are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are evident.\n- The code follows typical packaging patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.\n\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated code.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code is static and does not handle untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Version and file handling:**  \n  The version strings are static, derived from predefined variables, with no external input.  \n  The README.md is read locally, which is safe.\n\n- **Package data referencing JAR files:**  \n  The pattern `*_{scala_compat_version}-{jar_version}.jar` is predictable and standard for Spark-related packages.\n\n- **Dependencies:**  \n  The `tests_require` list specifies dependencies with fixed versions, no dynamic or external fetching.\n\n- **No suspicious code behavior:**  \n  The script does not execute code from untrusted sources, does not perform network calls, nor does it contain any obfuscated or hidden code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  **0.** The code is benign.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  **0.** No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  **0.** No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify this as a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The reasoning is sound, and the scores assigned (all zero) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely for packaging and distribution, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
