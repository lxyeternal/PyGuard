{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package providing extensions to Apache Spark, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining variables for versioning; static string assignments for package metadata; listing dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Setting package metadata -> Defining dependencies and package data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Version strings and file paths are static and conventional. No code injection or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README.md file for the long description, sets versioning variables, and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package data. The code does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted input, or contain obfuscated or malicious logic. All operations are static and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply prepares the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
