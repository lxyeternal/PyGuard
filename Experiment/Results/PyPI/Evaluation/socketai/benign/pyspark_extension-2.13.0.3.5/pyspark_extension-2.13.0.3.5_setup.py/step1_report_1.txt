{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyspark-extension', used for packaging and distributing a library that extends Apache Spark.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, and extracts version info from predefined strings. No untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function writes package data, metadata, and dependencies, which are standard for package distribution. No untrusted data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded version strings and file read (README.md) into package metadata; no external data sources or user input flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (beyond standard package info), or suspicious logic are detected. The code strictly follows a typical setup.py pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setup from setuptools, defines version variables, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package configuration details. All variables are hardcoded and predefined. No dynamic or user input influences the package data or behavior. The code's purpose is to prepare a package for distribution without any network activity, code execution, or data manipulation beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It follows standard practices and contains no suspicious code or data flows.",
