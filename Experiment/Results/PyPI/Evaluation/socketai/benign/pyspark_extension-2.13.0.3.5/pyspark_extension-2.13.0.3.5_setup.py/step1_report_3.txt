{
  "purpose": "To define setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyspark-extension' which provides extensions to Apache Spark.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; obtaining version info from variables; no external untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Package setup configuration for distribution; no untrusted data sinks or output destinations involved.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from source to sink; the script reads local files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated sections. The package data references JAR files with predictable naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines version variables, reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with package metadata and data files. All actions are typical for a setup script, with no external inputs or suspicious code. The package_data references JAR files with specific version naming, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to normal setup script conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a Spark extension library. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It safely defines package metadata and includes data files for distribution.",
