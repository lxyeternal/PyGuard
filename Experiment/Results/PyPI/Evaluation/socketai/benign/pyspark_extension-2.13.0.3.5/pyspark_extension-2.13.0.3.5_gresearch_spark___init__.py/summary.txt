  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Spark utility library with capabilities for JVM interaction, environment management, and package installation. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The main security risk stems from subprocess calls that, if provided with untrusted inputs, could be exploited. Therefore, the code should be used with proper input validation and in trusted environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting moderate concern over subprocess execution without input sanitization."
