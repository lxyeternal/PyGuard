  "purpose": "Unit tests for Spark DataFrame operations, specifically testing the 'with_row_numbers' method and cache management.",
  "sources": "DataFrame creation with static data, import statements, and test method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data input, no output to external systems, and no code execution from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static DataFrame creation through test methods; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; usage appears standard for testing Spark DataFrame functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests using the unittest framework for Spark DataFrame operations. It creates static test data and verifies the behavior of the 'with_row_numbers' method, including various ordering options and cache management. There are no indications of malicious code, external data inputs, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly adheres to testing functionality without any potentially harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate test code for Spark DataFrame methods. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious intent. The code functions within a testing environment and uses static data with no external or sensitive data handling.",
