  "purpose": "Unit tests for Spark extension functions, focusing on environment support, error handling, and feature validation.",
  "sources": "Environment flags, function calls raising exceptions, attribute overrides, and Spark context objects.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising for unsupported features; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Function calls in specific environments trigger exceptions; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic; standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of environment-aware unit tests verifying Spark support features, raising exceptions when features are unsupported or environment conditions are not met. It does not process untrusted input, communicate externally, or contain malicious payloads. The exception messages are clear and intended for testing environment constraints. No obfuscation or malicious activity is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign, testing nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, environment-aware testing suite for Spark extension functionalities, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minimal security risk stems from environment checks and exception handling, which are standard in testing code. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
