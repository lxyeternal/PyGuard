  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to a variable, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "No external sources; the code is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple, straightforward assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to a variable, typical in package metadata. No inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions are present. The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The logic is clear, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
