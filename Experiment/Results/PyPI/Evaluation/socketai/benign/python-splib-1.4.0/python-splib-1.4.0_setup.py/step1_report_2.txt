{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the packaging of the Python library 'python-splib' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function reads package metadata such as name, version, packages, install_requires, and description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or sensitive information are present.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package metadata declarations to the package distribution process; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward setup configuration with standard usage of setuptools; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata, including dependencies specified in 'install_requires'. The dependencies are standard and include 'python-tracing', 'shopee-sp-protocol', 'garena-common', and 'loggingtool-shopee'. The code performs a typical package setup without any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. No input/output sources or sensitive data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with specified dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The dependencies are common packages, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
