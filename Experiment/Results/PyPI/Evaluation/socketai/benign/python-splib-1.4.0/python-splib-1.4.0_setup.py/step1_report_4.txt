  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'python-splib' Python package, including its name, version, included packages, dependencies, and description.",
  "sources": "N/A (The code does not read external input or data; it specifies package metadata and dependencies.)",
  "sinks": "N/A (No untrusted data flows or vulnerable data handling present in this code.)",
  "flows": "N/A (There are no data flows from sources to sinks in this setup configuration.)",
  "anomalies": "The dependencies listed include 'shopee-sp-protocol', 'garena-common', and 'loggingtool-shopee', which could suggest association with specific platforms or applications but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup call that specifies package metadata and dependencies. All dependencies appear to be related to known or plausible Python packages, some with platform or service-specific names. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware indications are detected.",
