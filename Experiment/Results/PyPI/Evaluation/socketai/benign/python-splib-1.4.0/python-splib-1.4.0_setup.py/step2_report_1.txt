  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or external data handling is present.\n- Dependencies are standard or platform-specific but do not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the original script:**\n   - The code matches exactly with the description: a static call to `setup()` with fixed parameters.\n   - No discrepancies or missing elements.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The dependencies are specified with version constraints, which is good practice.\n   - No problematic code patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Risk scores:**\n   - Since no malicious or suspicious activity is detected, a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk score above 0.5.\n\n5. **Malware score justification:**\n   - The package dependencies include names like `shopee-sp-protocol` and `garena-common`, which are related to gaming platforms or services.\n   - While these could be targeted for malicious purposes if compromised, their mere inclusion in a setup script does not indicate malicious activity.\n   - No code behavior suggests malware.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they rely on static analysis.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nThe code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The dependencies are platform-specific but do not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
