  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward `setuptools` setup script with static strings. There are no dynamic elements, no input processing, and no suspicious code segments. The code simply declares package metadata and dependencies, which is typical for Python packaging.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.  \n- They mention dependencies like `'shopee-sp-protocol'` and `'garena-common'`, which are platform-specific but do not imply malicious intent solely by their presence.  \n- No report suggests any logical errors or security flaws in the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.  \n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, these scores are appropriate.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- The code does not perform any operations beyond static declarations.  \n- The dependencies, while platform-specific, are not inherently malicious or risky in this context.  \n- Therefore, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- No malware is indicated or implied by the code.  \n- The dependency names alone do not suggest malicious activity.  \n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is standard and that dependencies do not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard Python package setup script with no dynamic behavior, no suspicious code, and no evidence of malicious intent. The dependencies are platform-specific but not inherently malicious. All indicators point to a benign configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
