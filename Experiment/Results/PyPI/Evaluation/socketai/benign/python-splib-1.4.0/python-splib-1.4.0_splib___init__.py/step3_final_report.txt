  "purpose": "The code imports internal modules and attempts to execute subprocesses that run inline Python code importing 'shopeeloggingtool.dist_util'.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen calls executing 'python -c' commands importing 'shopeeloggingtool.dist_util'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external Python code outside the main process, potentially leading to malicious code execution or environment manipulation.",
  "flows": "Subprocess calls execute 'python -c \"import shopeeloggingtool.dist_util\"', which could be exploited to run arbitrary code if the environment or package is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run inline Python code importing external modules, silent error handling, static commands that do not process external input.",
  "analysis": "The code's main concern is the pattern of subprocess calls executing inline Python commands importing 'shopeeloggingtool.dist_util'. These calls are static and do not process external input but execute code outside the main process, which is suspicious. No direct malicious payloads or secrets are evident, but this pattern could be exploited if the 'shopeeloggingtool' package is malicious or compromised. The subprocess calls are unusual and could be used to load malicious modules or execute arbitrary code, especially considering the silent error handling that could mask failures. The scores assigned in the reports reflect moderate suspicion, with malware scores around 0.3-0.4 and security risk scores around 0.45-0.6. Given the static nature of the commands and absence of evidence of malicious payloads, the scores are reasonable but could be slightly increased to reflect the potential risk. The pattern warrants further investigation into the trustworthiness of 'shopeeloggingtool' and possibly refactoring to avoid dynamic code execution outside the main process.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing subprocess calls to import external modules dynamically is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the pattern's potential for abuse justifies a moderate malware score (~0.4) and a higher security risk (~0.6). Further review of the 'shopeeloggingtool' package and environment is recommended to ensure safety.",
