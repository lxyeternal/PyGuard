  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports identify the subprocess calls executing inline Python code to import `shopeeloggingtool.dist_util`.\n- The main code is standard, importing internal modules, constants, errors, and version info.\n- The subprocess calls are unusual because they run inline Python commands to import external modules dynamically.\n- No evidence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or explicit malicious payloads is present.\n- The potential concern is whether these subprocess calls could be exploited or are intentionally malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Score Analysis:**\n  - Malware: 0.3\n  - Security Risk: 0.45\n- **Justification:**\n  - The report notes that subprocess calls are suspicious but not definitively malicious.\n  - The score seems reasonable; it recognizes moderate risk but not high.\n- **Recommendation:**\n  - Slightly lower malware score to 0.2-0.3, considering no direct malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Score Analysis:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.3\n- **Justification:**\n  - The report considers subprocess calls unusual but benign in static analysis.\n  - Malware score of 0 aligns with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Recommendation:**\n  - Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- **Score Analysis:**\n  - Malware: 0.2\n  - Security Risk: 0.6\n- **Justification:**\n  - Slightly higher malware score due to the potential for malicious code execution via subprocess.\n  - The risk score is justified given the pattern of executing external code.\n- **Recommendation:**\n  - The malware score could be increased to 0.3 if considering the pattern as potentially malicious, but as static, still low.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- **Score Analysis:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Justification:**\n  - The report considers the subprocess calls suspicious but not malicious.\n  - Malware score seems appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:**\n  - No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- **Score Analysis:**\n  - Malware: 0.4\n  - Security Risk: 0.5\n- **Justification:**\n  - The higher malware score reflects concern over executing external code that could be malicious.\n  - The risk score is justified.\n- **Recommendation:**\n  - Malware score could be slightly lowered to 0.3 if no direct malicious activity is confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- The core concern is the subprocess calls executing inline Python code importing `shopeeloggingtool.dist_util`.\n- No direct evidence of malware or hardcoded secrets.\n- The pattern of dynamic code execution via subprocess is suspicious but not confirmed malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.2 - 0.3 (Moderate concern, pattern of dynamic code execution)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (No obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4 (Moderate security risk due to subprocess pattern)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The subprocess calls are potentially exploitable if the environment or package is compromised.\n- They could be used to load malicious modules or execute arbitrary code.\n- However, static analysis shows no explicit malicious payloads or secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code's primary function is benign.\n- The subprocess pattern is suspicious and warrants further review of the `shopeeloggingtool` package.\n- I recommend monitoring or restricting subprocess calls and verifying the integrity of `shopeeloggingtool`.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.3**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.4**\n\nThese reflect moderate concern but no confirmed malicious activity.",
