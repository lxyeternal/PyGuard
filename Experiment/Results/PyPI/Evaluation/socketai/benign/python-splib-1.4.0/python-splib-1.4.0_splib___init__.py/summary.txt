  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing subprocess calls to import external modules dynamically is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the pattern's potential for abuse justifies a moderate malware score (~0.4) and a higher security risk (~0.6). Further review of the 'shopeeloggingtool' package and environment is recommended to ensure safety."
