  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes lineage tracking via graph nodes, edges, and properties.\n- **Sinks:** Modifications via adding edges/nodes, relabeling (nx.relabel_nodes), and removing nodes.\n- **Flows:** Data from parameters and class attributes into graph modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; use of 'handle_wildcard' could be a concern but its implementation isn't shown.\n- **Analysis:** Standard lineage graph operations; no malicious behavior evident.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; potential concern about 'handle_wildcard' but unlikely malicious.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2 (low)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Building and manipulating lineage graphs, including relabeling.\n- **Sinks:** Adding/removing nodes and edges, especially 'nx.relabel_nodes' and 'g.remove_node'.\n- **Flows:** Internal graph modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; 'nx.relabel_nodes' is standard.\n- **Analysis:** Standard lineage processing; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate graph manipulation; low security concern.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Managing lineage graphs with node and edge properties.\n- **Sinks:** Adding edges/nodes, especially in methods like 'add_read', 'add_write', etc.\n- **Flows:** From method parameters into graph modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; standard graph operations.\n- **Analysis:** Graph-based lineage tracking, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2 (low)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Constructing and merging lineage graphs.\n- **Sinks:** Graph modifications, relabeling, node removal.\n- **Flows:** Data from parameters and graph attributes.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscated or malicious code; 'nx.relabel_nodes' is safe.\n- **Analysis:** Standard lineage graph operations.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; low security risk.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Building and manipulating lineage graphs.\n- **Sinks:** Adding/removing nodes and edges, relabeling.\n- **Flows:** From input parameters into graph modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; standard graph operations.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard lineage code.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SQL lineage tracking using networkx graphs.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor point is the 'handle_wildcard' function, which could process dynamic input, but without its implementation, this is speculative and not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risks.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low; standard lineage graph manipulation)\n\n**Note:** The operations performed are typical for lineage tracking systems and do not indicate any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation for SQL lineage analysis. No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minor concern about 'handle_wildcard' is not sufficient to elevate the risk score. Overall, the code appears safe.",
