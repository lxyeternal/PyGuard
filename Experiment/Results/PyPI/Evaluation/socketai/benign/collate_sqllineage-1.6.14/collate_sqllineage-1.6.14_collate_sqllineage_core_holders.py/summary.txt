  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SQL lineage tracking. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is found. The minor concern about 'handle_wildcard' does not impact the overall security posture. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard graph operations without malicious intent."
