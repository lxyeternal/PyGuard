{
  "purpose": "The code implements SQL lineage tracking using graph structures, managing nodes and edges representing tables, columns, and data flows.",
  "sources": "Graph nodes and class attributes such as self.graph, class properties, and method parameters that read or modify the graph structure.",
  "sinks": "Graph modification functions like add_edge, add_node, relabel_nodes, remove_node, and attribute setting functions that alter the graph state based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class attributes into graph modification operations, including relabeling nodes, adding edges, and setting node attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the external 'handle_wildcard' function without its implementation; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs and manipulates lineage graphs through standard networkx operations such as adding/removing nodes and edges, relabeling, and composing graphs. No malicious code patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The only potential concern is the 'handle_wildcard' function, which could process untrusted input; however, without its implementation, this remains speculative. The overall structure and operations are typical for lineage tools, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SQL lineage tracking. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is found. The minor concern about 'handle_wildcard' does not impact the overall security posture. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard graph operations without malicious intent.",
