  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring and distributing the package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing package metadata from 'collate_sqllineage', static package data paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or dynamic code execution points present.",
  "flows": "Importing package info -> reading static README file -> calling setup() with explicit parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports package metadata, reads a README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with dependencies, package data, and entry points. It does not contain dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated segments. All dependencies and package data are explicitly specified. No suspicious behaviors or security issues are evident. The code adheres to standard practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
