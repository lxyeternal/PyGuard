  "purpose": "Setup script for the collate_sqllineage Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing package constants (NAME, STATIC_FOLDER, VERSION) from collate_sqllineage; listing dependencies in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes with untrusted data, or system commands execution.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md into long_description; importing constants; passing package data patterns; installing dependencies; defining entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports package information, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No code execution, dynamic evaluation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The package data paths and dependencies appear normal. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It performs typical package configuration tasks without executing or importing untrusted code. The package dependencies and data paths seem legitimate.",
