  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the collate_sqllineage package, including dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; importing package metadata from collate_sqllineage; reading package data files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md), importing package variables, and passing data into setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. Use of dynamic file inclusion paths for package data is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package metadata and defines the package setup configuration. It reads the README.md file to include as long description and specifies package data patterns, dependencies, and console scripts. No external network calls, no eval or exec, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors are detected. The dependencies are standard, and the package data inclusion follows typical conventions. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly uses setuptools for packaging, and no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
