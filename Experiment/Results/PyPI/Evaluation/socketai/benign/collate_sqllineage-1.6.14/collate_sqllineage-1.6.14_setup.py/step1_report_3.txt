  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for a Python package called collate_sqllineage, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, imports package metadata from collate_sqllineage, and uses find_packages to identify package modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or interacts with external systems directly; dependencies are specified but not executed here.",
  "flows": "N/A — The script primarily performs package configuration without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard setup tools and dependency declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It reads a README file, imports package metadata, and defines package data, dependencies, and console scripts. All elements are standard practice, with no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It appears safe and typical for package distribution.",
