  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No untrusted data, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The code imports package metadata and reads static files, which is typical.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code segments are identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, high confidence.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as there's no security risk.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is accurate; no anomalies or malicious behaviors.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, high confidence.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** Correctly identifies standard setup script behavior.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (1.0), but still no issues.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — perhaps a slight overestimation; the code is standard.\n- **Comments:** The note about reading README.md and importing package variables is typical; no malicious activity.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup script, no issues.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** All observations align with the code.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly states that no suspicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct given the code content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is justified because the script performs standard package setup tasks without any security risks.\n\n**However,** the only point of contention is the small security risk score (0.1 in report 3). Given the code's simplicity and standard nature, this should be 0, not 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — confirmed no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks present.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are appropriate, except for the minor security risk score in report 3, which should be adjusted to 0.\n\n**My final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's content.",
