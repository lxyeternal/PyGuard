  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalous patterns based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, network calls, file reads, user inputs, or external data fetches.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network transmissions, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources to sinks, indicating how untrusted data propagates through the code to potentially malicious or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or behaviors inconsistent with benign code, such as unnecessary dynamic execution or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any suspicious patterns, malicious indicators, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign code with high confidence. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in one case—are consistent with the provided descriptions. The only minor inconsistency is the securityRisk score of 0.2 in Report 3, which should be lowered to 0.1 given no evidence of suspicious activity. Overall, the assessments are justified and aligned with the evidence, reflecting a benign security posture.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the absence or benign nature of the code. The scores are appropriate, with a minor adjustment recommended for Report 3's securityRisk. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, and the overall security risk remains low. The evaluations are consistent and justified based on the provided information.",
