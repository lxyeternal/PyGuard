  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a sample or template for a Python script, possibly for educational or testing purposes. There is no clear functional goal or application evident from the provided code.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input from external sources, files, or environment variables. It only uses imported libraries and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or where sensitive data could be leaked. No network connections or data exfiltration points are visible.",
  "flows": "Since no untrusted input sources are detected, there are no source-to-sink data flows present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs. It does not include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The code structure is straightforward and uses standard Python syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or minimal, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. There are no backdoors, malicious network activity, or data theft mechanisms. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest it is benign. Without additional code context, it is not possible to identify any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be safe and benign. Confidence is high that this code is not malicious or obfuscated.",
