{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for SQL lineage analysis and visualization using the collate_sqllineage library.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments (-e, -f, -v, -l, -g, -H, -p, -d, -ds) and optional SQL input from files or command line.",
  "sinks": "Data flow includes passing SQL queries to LineageRunner, printing dialect lists, and invoking drawing functions. No untrusted data directly influences system commands or external system calls.",
  "flows": "User inputs (args) -> extract_sql_from_args -> LineageRunner methods or draw_lineage_graph or print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. Logging warnings are standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code relies on user input and external libraries, but does not exhibit malicious intent or dangerous behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper around the collate_sqllineage library, parsing arguments and calling corresponding methods. It handles user input securely by sanitizing command-line arguments and uses standard logging and argument parsing. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are evident. No hardcoded secrets, system commands, or network connections are present. The code mainly orchestrates library functions without implementing risky logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It functions as a CLI interface for SQL lineage analysis without performing any dangerous operations. There are no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
