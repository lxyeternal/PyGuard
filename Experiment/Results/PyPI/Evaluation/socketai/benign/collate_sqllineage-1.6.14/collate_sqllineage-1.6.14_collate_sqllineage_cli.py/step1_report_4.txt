{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for SQL lineage analysis, including visualization and dialect management.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments (-e, -f), environment variables (if any used elsewhere), and internal constants.",
  "sinks": "LineageRunner methods (print_table_lineage, print_column_lineage, draw), print statements, and web server visualization setup.",
  "flows": "User provides SQL via -e or -f, which is extracted and passed to LineageRunner. Visualization and output depend on user options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No use of unsafe eval or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles CLI argument parsing, logging configuration, and invoking lineage analysis via the LineageRunner class. It allows SQL input from the user, visualization options, and dialect management. There are no indications of malicious code such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The script does not execute untrusted code beyond calling external classes, which are assumed to be part of the open-source project. It does not handle or store sensitive data insecurely, nor does it perform any operations that could leak data or harm the system. The structure and flow are typical for a CLI tool and do not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard CLI interface for an SQL lineage analysis tool with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely processes user input and invokes external functionality responsibly. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
