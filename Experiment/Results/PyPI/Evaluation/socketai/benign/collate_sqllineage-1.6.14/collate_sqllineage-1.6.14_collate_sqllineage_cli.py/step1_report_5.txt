{
  "purpose": "The code implements a command-line interface for a SQL lineage analysis tool, allowing users to input SQL queries directly, from files, or visualize lineage graphs.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (-e, -f, -v, -l, -g, -H, -p, -d, -ds), and file reading (extract_sql_from_args function).",
  "sinks": "Execution of LineageRunner with SQL code and visualization parameters; printing of dialect list.",
  "flows": "User provides SQL or file input -> extract_sql_from_args processes input -> LineageRunner executes SQL analysis or visualization -> output or visualization shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. No obfuscated code. The code relies on external functions and libraries, but their usage appears standard. The only minor concern is potential user input that could be passed unvalidated to SQL processing, but this is typical for CLI tools and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages user input, sets up command-line arguments, and invokes external library functions for SQL lineage processing and visualization. There are no indicators of malicious code, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not perform unsafe operations like executing untrusted code directly, nor does it contain hardcoded secrets or sensitive data. The logic appears straightforward, with input handling and delegation to external modules. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper around SQL lineage functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI application for SQL lineage analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It only processes user inputs and invokes external modules for analysis and visualization. There are no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious payloads detected.",
