{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for the sqllineage tool, allowing users to analyze SQL queries for lineage and visualization.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (-e, -f, --dialects, etc.), environment variables (not used explicitly), and internal function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Execution of functions like extract_sql_from_args, LineageRunner methods (draw, print_column_lineage, print_table_lineage), and printing output.",
  "flows": "User input flows from command-line arguments to extract_sql_from_args, then to LineageRunner methods for processing or visualization, or to print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL endpoints, or obfuscated code. Use of logging warnings for conflicting options is normal. No unusual or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles CLI argument parsing, configuration, and invoking other components of the sqllineage package. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations beyond reading SQL files, or sensitive data handling within this code. The functions called (like extract_sql_from_args and LineageRunner) are external; based on this snippet, no malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate CLI interface for a SQL lineage analysis tool. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident within this code fragment. It is a standard command-line utility setup without suspicious elements.",
