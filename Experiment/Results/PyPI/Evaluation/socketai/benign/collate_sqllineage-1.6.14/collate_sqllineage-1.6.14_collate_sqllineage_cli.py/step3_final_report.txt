  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for the collate_sqllineage library, handling argument parsing and delegating SQL analysis and visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (-e, -f, -v, -l, -g, -H, -p, -d, -ds), external functions extract_sql_from_args and user-provided files",
  "sinks": "External library functions (LineageRunner, draw_lineage_graph) that process SQL and visualization requests",
  "flows": "User inputs flow into argument parser, then into extract_sql_from_args and external processing functions without executing code directly",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that parses user input, sets configurations, and delegates processing to external, presumably safe, modules. It does not execute or evaluate SQL internally, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The minimal risk stems from handling user input, which is standard for CLI tools, and the external libraries' security depends on their maintenance. The code structure and logic are typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI wrapper with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
