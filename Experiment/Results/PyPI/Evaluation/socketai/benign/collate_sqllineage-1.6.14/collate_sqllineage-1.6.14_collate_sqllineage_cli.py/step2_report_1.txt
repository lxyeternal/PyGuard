  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is safe, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It correctly notes that the code is a CLI wrapper, handling user input securely and delegating to external libraries.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dangerous operations. The logic is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no malicious intent, no code injection, and standard CLI handling. It notes the use of external modules, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly above zero, reflecting minimal residual concern, but justified given the limited scope.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior. The small risk score accounts for potential user input issues, but overall, the code appears safe.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis finds no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no dangerous code. The code is a CLI wrapper with standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly higher, perhaps to reflect the handling of user input via command-line arguments that could, in theory, be malicious if the external processing functions are unsafe.\n- **Justification:** Since the code delegates to external functions (`extract_sql_from_args`, `LineageRunner`) and does not execute code directly, the risk is minimal. The small risk score seems acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard CLI handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns or dangerous operations are evident.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with standard input handling.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0.0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0.0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal potential concerns mainly related to user input handling, which is typical for CLI tools.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code appears straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — acceptable for a CLI wrapper, with no significant security concerns.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and well-behaved.** There are no signs of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malware. The small risk scores are justified by the nature of accepting user input, which is standard for CLI tools.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the information provided.",
