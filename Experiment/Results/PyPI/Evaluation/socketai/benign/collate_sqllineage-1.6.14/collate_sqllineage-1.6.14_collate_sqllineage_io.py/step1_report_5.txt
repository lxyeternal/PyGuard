  "purpose": "Convert a NetworkX directed graph into a list of Cytoscape-compatible node and edge dictionaries, with optional support for compound nodes to group related nodes.",
  "sources": "graph.nodes (reading node attributes and parent relationships), graph.edges (reading source and target nodes)",
  "sinks": "Returning the list of node and edge data; no external data or untrusted sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "Graph nodes and edges are read; data is transformed into a specific dictionary format; no external or untrusted data flow outside the transformation logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. Use of type hints and documentation appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to transform a NetworkX DiGraph into a Cytoscape format, optionally handling compound nodes with parent-child relationships. It reads node attributes such as 'parent' and 'parent_candidates', and constructs a list of dictionaries for nodes and edges. The code does not perform any external data input, network communication, or system modifications. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward data transformation with no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data transformation utility for visualizing graphs with optional compound nodes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. Overall, it is safe.",
