{
  "purpose": "The code implements a SQL lineage analysis tool, parsing SQL statements to determine data flow between tables and columns, and providing visualization options.",
  "sources": "Input SQL string provided during instantiation of LineageRunner; methods such as split() and trim_comment() for processing SQL statements.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate visualizations (draw_lineage_graph), convert data to cytoscape format, or print lineage information.",
  "flows": "Input SQL → split and trim comments → analysis with analyzers → storage in holder objects → visualization or printing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a lineage analysis utility, with lazy evaluation decorators and methods for SQL parsing, analysis, and visualization. It uses standard logging, warnings, and external libraries for analysis. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The code performs expected operations related to SQL analysis, with no signs of malicious intent. The deprecation warning for a dialect string is benign and related to user guidance. There are no indications of data leaks, system interference, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a SQL lineage analysis tool with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations. Overall, it seems safe for use.",
