  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Accurately describes the code as a SQL lineage analysis tool, with input SQL and functions like split() and trim_comment()—all consistent with the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Correctly identifies visualization and print functions as sinks, with logical data flow.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The deprecation warning is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Appropriately states the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (low, reasonable)\n  - confidence: 0.9 (high, justified)\n\n**Verdict**: Sound assessment. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly notes SQL analysis functions and visualization.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Logical flow from input to visualization/export.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code; warnings and print statements are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Appropriately concludes benign, well-structured code.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (low, reasonable)\n  - confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict**: Well-reasoned, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly describes analysis of SQL for lineage, including source/target/intermediate tables.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Logical data flow; visualization functions are standard.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code; warnings are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Appropriately states the code is legitimate, with no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (low, justified)\n  - confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict**: Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly identifies the class's role in SQL lineage analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Properly describes data flow; no external risks.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious features; standard warnings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Appropriately concludes benign, standard utility.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n  - confidence: 0.95\n\n**Verdict**: Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly notes input SQL, analyzers, and visualization.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Logical flow; no external leaks.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code; standard functions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Appropriately states the code is legitimate and safe.\n- **Scores**:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1\n  - confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict**: Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity or code patterns are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk**: Slight variation (0.1–0.2), but all are low and justified given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence**: High across all reports, justified by thorough reasoning.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, open-source-like SQL lineage analysis utility.\n- No suspicious behaviors, dynamic code execution, external network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- Visualization functions are common in such tools and do not introduce security risks.\n- The deprecation warning is benign and intended for user guidance.\n\n**My Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear code structure)\n- **Risk**: 0.1–0.2 (low, justified by the benign nature)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and align with the code's characteristics.
