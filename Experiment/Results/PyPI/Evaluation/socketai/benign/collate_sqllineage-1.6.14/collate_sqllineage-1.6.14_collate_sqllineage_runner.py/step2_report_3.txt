  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a SQL lineage analysis tool, with input SQL and helper functions (`split()`, `trim_comment()`).\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; outputs are visualization and print statements, with data flow clearly described.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of warnings is benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is safe, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the class for analyzing SQL lineage, with input SQL and visualization methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes visualization functions that could send data externally but are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of warnings and print statements are normal.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class as analyzing and visualizing SQL lineage, with input SQL and internal processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes potential points where data could be sent externally via visualization functions but finds no actual malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Warnings are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code appears legitimate, with a confidence of 0.9. Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the class analyzes SQL and visualizes lineage, with input SQL and analysis methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes visualization functions that could send data externally but are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is well-structured.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is benign, with a confidence of 0.95. Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class's purpose, input sources, and analysis flow.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes visualization functions that could generate external data but are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Warnings are benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard SQL lineage analysis utility.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** Minimal, primarily related to visualization functions that could potentially send data externally, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**. Code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1 to 0.2) is appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately score the code as safe. No modifications needed.",
