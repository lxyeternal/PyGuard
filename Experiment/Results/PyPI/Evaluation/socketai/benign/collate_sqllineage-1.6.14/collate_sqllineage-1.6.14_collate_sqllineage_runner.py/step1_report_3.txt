{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for analyzing and visualizing SQL statement lineage, including extracting source, target, and intermediate tables, and optionally drawing lineage graphs.",
  "sources": "Reads SQL string input via constructor parameter; retrieves and processes SQL statements in _eval method; accesses attributes such as source_tables, target_tables, intermediate_tables, and lineage graphs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include methods that convert lineage data into formats like cytoscape, and print statements that output lineage details. No direct data leaks or external data transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "SQL input flows through constructor to _eval method, which processes and analyzes the SQL to produce lineage data; lineage data can be visualized or printed; lineage graphs and table lists are generated from internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The use of warnings for deprecated dialect warnings is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code appears well-structured and typical for a lineage analysis tool.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with user-provided SQL and optional parameters, then analyzes the SQL to extract lineage information using different analyzers based on dialect. It includes lazy evaluations for computationally intensive properties, and provides methods for outputting lineage details and visualizations. No suspicious data handling, external network calls, or malicious behaviors are evident. The warning about deprecated dialect indicates maintenance considerations but not security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SQL lineage analysis tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads input data securely, processes lineage without external data leaks, and outputs lineage information or visualizations. No anomalies or malware indicators are detected.",
