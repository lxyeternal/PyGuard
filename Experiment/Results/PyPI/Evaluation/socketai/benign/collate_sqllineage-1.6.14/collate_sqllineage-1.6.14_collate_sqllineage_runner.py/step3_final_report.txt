  "purpose": "The code implements a SQL lineage analysis utility that parses SQL statements, extracts table and column relationships, and provides visualization and reporting functions.",
  "sources": "Input SQL string provided to the LineageRunner class, functions like split() and trim_comment() that process the SQL statements.",
  "sinks": "Visualization functions (draw_lineage_graph, to_cytoscape), print statements for lineage output, warnings for deprecated dialects.",
  "flows": "Input SQL -> Parsing and analysis via analyzers -> Storage of lineage data in holder objects -> Visualization or print functions accessing lineage data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The deprecation warning is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for analyzing SQL lineage. It uses common libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious intent. The functions perform parsing, analysis, and visualization without external network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe SQL lineage analysis tool with no malicious or obfuscated components. It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to visualization routines that are standard and benign. The overall assessment aligns across the reports, and no modifications are necessary.",
