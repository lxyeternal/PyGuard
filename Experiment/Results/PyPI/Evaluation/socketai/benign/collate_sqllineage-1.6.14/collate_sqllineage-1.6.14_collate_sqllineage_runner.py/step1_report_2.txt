{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for analyzing SQL statement lineage, including parsing SQL, extracting table and column relationships, and visualizing lineage graphs.",
  "sources": "Input SQL string provided during class initialization and potentially user inputs in related methods (e.g., to_cytoscape, draw).",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate visualizations (draw_lineage_graph) and export lineage data (to_cytoscape) which may send data externally. Also, the use of warnings.warn and print statements.",
  "flows": "Input SQL -> split into statements -> analysis via analyzers -> extraction of lineage info -> visualization/export functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of warnings and print statements are typical. No obfuscated code present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, well-organized lineage analysis tool that processes SQL statements to derive table and column relationships. It uses lazy evaluation for performance optimization and offers visualization capabilities. All external interactions are limited to visualization functions or warnings. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The presence of warnings and print statements are benign. The code primarily handles SQL analysis and visualization tasks, with no suspicious or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured SQL lineage analysis module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious data handling. It functions as an analytical tool with no suspicious or harmful features.",
