  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and logging setup for the application, including environment-based directory paths.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('SQLLINEAGE_DIRECTORY') and os.path.dirname(__file__)",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; environment variables and filesystem paths are read.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and file path reading, used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'SQLLINEAGE_DIRECTORY' for directory path, which could be manipulated externally but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up constants and a logging configuration, using environment variables and local file paths. There are no indications of data flow to external systems, no hardcoded secrets, and no untrusted input processing beyond configuration. The environment variable usage is typical for configurable paths and does not seem malicious. No obfuscated code, no code injection, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration setup for logging and directory paths with no malicious behavior detected. The use of environment variables is normal for configurable directories and does not pose an immediate security risk.",
