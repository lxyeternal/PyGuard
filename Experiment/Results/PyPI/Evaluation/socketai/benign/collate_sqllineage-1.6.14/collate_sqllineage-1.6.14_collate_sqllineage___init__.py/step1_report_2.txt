  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Python application related to logging, environment variable reading, and default settings.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('SQLLINEAGE_DIRECTORY') for environment variable; __file__ for current file path.",
  "sinks": "None directly, but environment variable could influence data paths used by the application.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> DATA_FOLDER; __file__ -> default data directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or malicious code. Use of environment variable for directory path is standard practice; no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and a logging configuration. It reads an environment variable to determine a data directory path, which is a common pattern for flexible configuration. No data is being sent externally, no code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present. The use of __file__ for data path is typical. The logging configuration appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. It simply configures logging and application settings.",
