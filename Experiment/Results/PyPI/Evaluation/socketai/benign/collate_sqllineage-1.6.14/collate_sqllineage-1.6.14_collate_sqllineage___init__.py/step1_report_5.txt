  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Python application, including logging and environment-based directory paths.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SQLLINEAGE_DIRECTORY' using os.environ.get",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get and os.path.join for directory path resolution",
  "flows": "Environment variable input flows into directory path configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of environment variables is standard for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code sets static configurations for logging, folder paths, and application parameters. It uses environment variables to determine data directories, which is a common and secure practice. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious external network connections are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily handles configuration and logging setup without any malicious intent or security risks. It safely uses environment variables for flexible configuration, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malware or malicious activities.",
