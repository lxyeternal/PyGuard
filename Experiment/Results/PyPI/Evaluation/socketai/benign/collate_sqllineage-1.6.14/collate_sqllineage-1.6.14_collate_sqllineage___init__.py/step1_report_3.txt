  "purpose": "This code sets configuration constants and logging settings for a Python application related to SQL lineage processing.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SQLLINEAGE_DIRECTORY' via os.environ.get",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or untrusted data handling points observed",
  "flows": "Environment variable input affects DATA_FOLDER path, but no data flow to sensitive sinks or external systems",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration variables for logging and data directories. It retrieves an environment variable for DATA_FOLDER with a default fallback. Logging is configured with fixed format and levels. No user input, network operations, or code execution features are present. The code appears to be straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script setting up logging and paths without any malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
