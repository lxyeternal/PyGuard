  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Python application, including logging and environment variable management.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SQLLINEAGE_DIRECTORY' via os.environ.get()",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data is used in critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable input is used to determine DATA_FOLDER; no untrusted data flows into code execution or data handling beyond setting a directory path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports or code behavior. The environment variable is used safely to set a directory path. No obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration variables, including a logging setup and default paths. It reads an environment variable 'SQLLINEAGE_DIRECTORY' to dynamically set the data directory, defaulting to a local path. No untrusted data is used in insecure ways, and there are no signs of malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard configuration code, with no complex logic, no external code execution, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup with safe handling of environment variables and no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
