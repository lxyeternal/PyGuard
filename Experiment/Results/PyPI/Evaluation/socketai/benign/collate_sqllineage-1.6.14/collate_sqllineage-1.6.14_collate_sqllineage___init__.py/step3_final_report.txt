  "purpose": "Configuration setup for logging and data directory, using environment variables for flexibility.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SQLLINEAGE_DIRECTORY' and __file__ path for data folder; constants for app name, version, and logging.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; configuration influences internal paths and logging behavior only.",
  "flows": "Environment variable affects DATA_FOLDER; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration script defining constants, setting up logging, and reading an environment variable for data directory. It does not perform any data transmission, code injection, or malicious activity. The environment variable usage is standard and safe, and the code structure is clear and maintainable. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The risk is minimal, primarily related to environment variable manipulation, which is common in configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration setup without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
