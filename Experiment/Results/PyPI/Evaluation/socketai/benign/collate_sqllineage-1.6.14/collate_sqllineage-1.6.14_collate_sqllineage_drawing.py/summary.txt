  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard web application serving static files and providing API endpoints for SQL lineage analysis. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The minimal security concern relates to static file path validation, which could be improved for production deployment, but does not indicate malicious intent."
