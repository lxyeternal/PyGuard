{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WSGI web application serving static files and providing API endpoints for SQL lineage analysis, script extraction, and directory browsing, primarily for internal or development use.",
  "sources": "Reads static files from the filesystem based on URL paths; processes JSON payloads from POST requests; invokes external modules for SQL processing.",
  "sinks": "Reads files from disk; processes untrusted JSON input; calls external modules without internal validation; responds with JSON or static content.",
  "flows": "GET requests read static files; POST requests pass payloads to route handlers which invoke external modules; minimal path validation is performed before file access.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal path sanitization (only checking for '..') in static file serving; reliance on external modules without internal validation; no use of secure path resolution methods.",
  "analysis": "The application is a straightforward web server serving static content and providing API endpoints for SQL lineage analysis. It performs minimal input validation, mainly checking for directory traversal attempts via '..'. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. External modules are invoked for processing but their security cannot be assessed here; their safe use is assumed. The code does not perform network connections, system command execution, or data exfiltration. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern primarily due to basic path validation. Overall, the code appears benign and suitable for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard web application serving static files and providing API endpoints for SQL lineage analysis. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The minimal security concern relates to static file path validation, which could be improved for production deployment, but does not indicate malicious intent.",
