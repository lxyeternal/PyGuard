  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SQL lineage analysis errors",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from Exception",
  "sinks": "None; static class definitions with no data input/output",
  "flows": "None; no runtime data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class hierarchy and docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or external data interactions. The code is clear, well-structured, and contains no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns. Given the static and benign nature, there are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and reflect the static, harmless nature of the code.",
