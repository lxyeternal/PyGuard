  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SQL lineage analysis errors",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are just definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard class inheritance and docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. No input/output operations, no data processing, and no dynamic or insecure behavior are present. The structure appears typical for custom exception definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. It is purely structural and does not perform any runtime actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for SQL lineage analysis. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
