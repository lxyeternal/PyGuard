  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or runtime behavior.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no malicious code.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence Confirmation**\n- The code snippets are straightforward class definitions; no issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reports**\n\nAll five reports:\n- Correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes.\n- Rightly conclude there's no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- Assign a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n### **Scores and Justifications**\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate.\n- No malware or malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All assign `0`, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n**Security risk score:**\n- All assign `0`, which is justified.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- All assign `0` or very low, reflecting no security concern.\n- The overall risk is negligible, as the code is purely structural.\n\n**Potential issues with scoring:**\n- No issues are present; the scores are appropriate.\n- No need to adjust scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenging Assumptions & Reasoning**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n### **Conclusion & Personal Estimation**\n\nGiven the consistency and correctness of all reports, my assessment aligns with theirs.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:**\n- The code snippet is benign and purely structural.\n- No security risks or malicious intent are detectable.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.",
