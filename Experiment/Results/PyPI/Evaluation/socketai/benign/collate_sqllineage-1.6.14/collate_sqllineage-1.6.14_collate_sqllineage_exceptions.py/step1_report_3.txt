  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SQL lineage analysis errors",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or external data sources",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or output actions",
  "flows": "None; no data flow paths present",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom exception classes, no suspicious or malicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class. These classes are used for handling specific error conditions related to SQL lineage analysis: general errors, unsupported statements, and syntax issues. The implementation is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or data transmission. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concern signals. It serves as part of a larger application's error handling mechanism.",
