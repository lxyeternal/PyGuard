{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SQL lineage analysis errors",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; code only defines classes",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow; just class inheritance structure",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code contains simple custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors present. The code is static, with no runtime data processing, network access, or sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for SQL lineage processing. There is no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
