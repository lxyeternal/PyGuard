  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare the findings with the code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines static custom exception classes with no runtime behavior, input/output, or external data handling.\n   - There are no anomalies, no dynamic code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and contains no issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They uniformly state that the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is simple class definitions, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - The code shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's static and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, with no issues.  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- No adjustments needed to the scores or conclusions.",
