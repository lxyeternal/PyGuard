  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SQL lineage analysis errors",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance statements",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points present",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations involved",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python class definitions for custom exceptions related to SQL lineage processing. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communication elements. The exception classes inherit from each other in a straightforward manner, with descriptive docstrings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code appears to be part of a larger project where these exceptions would be raised in specific scenarios, but in isolation, it contains no malicious or security-related issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines custom exception classes for SQL lineage analysis without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard implementation with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
