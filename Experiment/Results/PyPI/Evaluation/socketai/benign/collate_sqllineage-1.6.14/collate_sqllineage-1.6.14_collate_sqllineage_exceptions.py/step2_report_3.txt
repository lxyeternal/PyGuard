  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, scoring rationale, and potential security implications.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external data handling. The code is static and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nNo logical errors or flaws are evident. The class hierarchy and docstrings are consistent and standard for such exception definitions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- *Obfuscated Score:* All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- *Malware Score:* All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- *Security Risk:* All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely structural with no runtime behavior, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted. All reports correctly assign a score of 0 for malware and security risk.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and stick to the facts: the code is standard, benign, and has no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n6. **Score Consistency and Reasonableness**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and justified by the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a typical pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are thorough and correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.  \n- No changes needed to the scoring or analysis.",
