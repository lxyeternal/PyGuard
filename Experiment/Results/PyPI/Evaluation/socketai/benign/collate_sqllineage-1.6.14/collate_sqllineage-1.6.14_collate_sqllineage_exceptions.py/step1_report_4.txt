  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SQL lineage analysis errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class and exception definitions",
  "sinks": "No data output or external communication; exception class definitions",
  "flows": "No data flows present, as there are only class declarations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, each with descriptive docstrings. There are no dynamic features, external data reads, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be standard, benign, and intended for error handling within a SQL lineage analysis context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes with no malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project.",
