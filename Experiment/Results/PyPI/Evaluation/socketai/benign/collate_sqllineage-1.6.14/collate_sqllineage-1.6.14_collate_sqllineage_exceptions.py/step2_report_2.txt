  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the appropriateness of the scores, and any potential discrepancies.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, consists solely of class definitions, and contains no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- The \"malware\" score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the static nature of the code.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, which is correct given the straightforward class definitions.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description; no issues are present.\n   - All reports correctly state that the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in any report.\n   - The reasoning is consistent, emphasizing the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence, 0 for obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, straightforward class definitions.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Risk and malware justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime behavior, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate, as there are no malicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes are needed. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that accurately.",
