  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- Defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n- No dynamic behavior, input/output, or data processing.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No issues, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.5 (not explicitly stated but implied).\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious or security concerns. The risk score of 0 seems appropriate.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are straightforward class definitions; scores are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate. The reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports — consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all, as no security risks are evident.\n\n**If I were to assign my own estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code snippet is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions with no security concerns.",
