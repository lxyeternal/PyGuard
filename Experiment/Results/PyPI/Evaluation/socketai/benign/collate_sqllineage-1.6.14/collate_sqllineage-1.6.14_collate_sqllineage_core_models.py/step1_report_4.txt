  "purpose": "Define data models and utility classes for representing database schemas, tables, paths, functions, subqueries, columns, and analysis context in a SQL lineage tool.",
  "sources": "Escape functions (escape_identifier_name), class constructors, and property methods that handle input strings such as schema names, table names, paths, function names, subquery raw strings, and column names.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) and hashing functions that process potentially untrusted input data, which are primarily used for object identification and comparison.",
  "flows": "Input data (schema, table, path, function, subquery, column names, URIs) -> escape_identifier_name (sanitize input) -> object construction -> __str__ or __repr__ (convert to string) -> hash functions for object identity.",
  "anomalies": "The use of escape_identifier_name on all input strings could be intended for sanitization, but without knowing its implementation, it could potentially be misused if it behaves maliciously. There are warnings for schema, table, function names in specific formats, but no actual sanitization or validation beyond that. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or other typical malware actions. Usage of __hash__ and __str__ methods could, in theory, be exploited if object state is manipulated maliciously, but these are standard pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of data classes representing database entities with methods for string conversion, equality, hashing, and some validation. The use of escape_identifier_name suggests some sanitization, but its implementation is unknown, leaving potential for misuse if it does not properly sanitize. No network, file, or system-modifying code exists. The constructors perform validation on input formats for schema, table, and function names, raising exceptions for invalid formats, which is good practice. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic is present. The warnings about name format are informational and do not perform dangerous actions. Overall, the code appears to be standard for an SQL lineage utility, with no malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data model classes for representing database schemas, tables, functions, paths, subqueries, and columns, with basic validation and sanitization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external network or system access, or sabotage. The potential risk hinges on the behavior of escape_identifier_name, which is not provided. If escape_identifier_name properly sanitizes inputs, the code is safe; otherwise, it could be exploited if malicious input is provided. Overall, the code itself does not contain malware or malicious intent.",
