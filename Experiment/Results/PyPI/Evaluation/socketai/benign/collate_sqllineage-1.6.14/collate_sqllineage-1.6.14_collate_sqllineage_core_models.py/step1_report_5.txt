  "purpose": "Define data classes and utilities for representing database schemas, tables, paths, functions, subqueries, columns, and context during SQL analysis.",
  "sources": "import statements, escape_identifier_name function calls, class constructors, and property/method accesses",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via __str__, __repr__, and __hash__ methods; warnings; exceptions raised in constructors",
  "flows": "Construction of schema/table/path/function/subquery/column objects, string conversions, hashing, and equality checks",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn for schema/table format; no hardcoded credentials or network calls; no obfuscated code; reliance on external escape_identifier_name function, which could be malicious if tampered with",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions for database schema components with standard initialization, string representation, and hashing methods. It uses escape_identifier_name to sanitize inputs, which if compromised, could introduce security issues. The classes contain no network activity, data leaks, or malicious code. The only notable behavior is the warning about schema and name formatting, which is benign. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious code are evident. The code's primary risk lies in potential misuse if escape_identifier_name is malicious or misused externally. Overall, the code appears to serve as a foundational library for SQL lineage analysis with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data classes for SQL analysis purposes. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected within this code segment. The only minor concern is dependency on an external function, which should be verified for security. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for normal operation.",
