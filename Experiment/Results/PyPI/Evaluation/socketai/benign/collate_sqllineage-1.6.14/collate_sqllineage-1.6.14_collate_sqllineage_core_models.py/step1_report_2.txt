{
  "purpose": "Define data classes for representing SQL components such as schemas, tables, paths, functions, subqueries, columns, and the analysis context, used for SQL lineage and dependency analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class constructors (name, uri, subquery, alias), static methods (of methods), and class attributes (e.g., uri in Path).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of input data when constructing string representations or identifiers, but no direct data leaks or dangerous system calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (names, URIs, subqueries) flows into data class instances, which convert and store sanitized versions of these inputs for internal use; no external systems or network calls are made.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or malicious payloads. The code uses warnings, but these are benign. No dynamic execution or external network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions with methods mainly for input validation, string representation, and hashing. The constructors sanitize inputs via escape_identifier_name, preventing injection when converting identifiers to strings. No code executes untrusted inputs or performs network activity. All methods are straightforward, with exception handling for invalid formats (e.g., in Table and DataFunction). The only notable aspect is consistent input sanitization, which is good for security. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are found.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code defines safe, structured representations of SQL components for lineage analysis, with input sanitization to prevent injection or misuse. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in this code segment.",
