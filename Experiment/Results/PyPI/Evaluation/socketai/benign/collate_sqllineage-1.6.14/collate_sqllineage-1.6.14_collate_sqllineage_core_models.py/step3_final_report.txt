  "purpose": "Define data classes for SQL schema components with input sanitization to prevent injection or formatting issues.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters for Schema, Table, DataFunction, Path, SubQuery, and Column classes; use of escape_identifier_name for sanitization.",
  "sinks": "None directly; data is stored internally, with potential external reliance on escape_identifier_name for sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class constructors, sanitized via escape_identifier_name, then stored as class attributes; no external data flows or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of escape_identifier_name without provided implementation; reliance on external sanitization function is a potential concern if malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data classes modeling SQL components, with input sanitization via escape_identifier_name. No network, file, or command execution is present. The main concern is the external sanitization function's safety; if safe, the code is benign. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (0.2) due to reliance on unverified sanitization. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary risk depends on the implementation of escape_identifier_name, which should be verified. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, and the code is suitable for use assuming sanitization is secure.",
