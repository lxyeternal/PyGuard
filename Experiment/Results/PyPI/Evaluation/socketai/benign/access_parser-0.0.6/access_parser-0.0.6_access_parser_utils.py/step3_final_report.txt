  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and interpreting data from MS Access database files, including date conversion, numeric formatting, text decoding, and page categorization.",
  "sources": "Binary data buffers read from database files, file input streams, and data segments within the database structure.",
  "sinks": "Decoded and formatted data returned as strings or byte sequences; logging warnings and debug information during parsing.",
  "flows": "Binary data is read from files or buffers, then unpacked using struct, decoded into text or numeric formats, and categorized into pages based on magic headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present. No network activity or external system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python libraries for binary unpacking, date conversion, and text decoding. It processes untrusted binary data as part of database parsing, which is expected. No obfuscation techniques or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions handle errors gracefully and log relevant warnings. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical database utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for parsing MS Access database files. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the data processing context but without any malicious implications.",
