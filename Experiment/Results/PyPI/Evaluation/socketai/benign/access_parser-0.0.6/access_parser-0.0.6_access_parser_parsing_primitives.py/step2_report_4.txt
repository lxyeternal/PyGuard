  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications, including malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is a set of data structures and parsing functions for interpreting binary data formats, with version-specific handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears benign and intended for legitimate data parsing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1—parsing binary data structures with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard parser, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, a data structure definition for parsing binary data, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 fit the benign assessment.\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring is consistent. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—parsing binary data, version-aware, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard parser.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score could be slightly increased if desired, but given the benign nature, 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, straightforward data parsing with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, declarative structure definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1-0.2) are reasonable, reflecting low security risk due to the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the code's purpose as a parser, which by itself is low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are consistent with the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or high security risk. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured binary data parser with no security concerns.",
