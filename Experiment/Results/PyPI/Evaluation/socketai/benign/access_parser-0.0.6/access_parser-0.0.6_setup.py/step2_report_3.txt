  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) using `setuptools`.\n- The code reads a local `README.md` file for the `long_description`.\n- The setup parameters include package name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, Python version requirement, and dependencies (`construct`, `tabulate`).\n- No external data sources, sinks, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or signs of malicious activity are detected.\n- The confidence level in all reports is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Code logic:** The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python package setup scripts.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Both are scored as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Also scored as 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate since there's no indication of security issues.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:\n\n- The reports do not mention any indirect risks, such as the dependencies (`construct`, `tabulate`). These are common packages and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The code does not execute any untrusted input or perform network operations, so the risk remains minimal.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- No evidence suggests malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n**Based on the analysis, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional note:** If there were any suspicion about the dependencies or the environment, further scrutiny might be warranted, but based on the provided code and reports, everything appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
