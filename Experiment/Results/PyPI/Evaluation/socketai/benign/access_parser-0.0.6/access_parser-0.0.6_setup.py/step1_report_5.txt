{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for the 'access_parser' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The 'setuptools.setup' function and 'open' function handle the package setup; no untrusted data or external input sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README file into the 'long_description' variable, then into the setup configuration; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging. It reads 'README.md' for detailed description, which is standard. It then calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network connections, or suspicious code behaviors. The dependencies are common and benign. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
