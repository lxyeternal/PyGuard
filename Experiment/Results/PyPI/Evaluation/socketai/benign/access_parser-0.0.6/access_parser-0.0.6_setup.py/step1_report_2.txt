  "purpose": "To set up the Python package 'access_parser' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, defining setup parameters including package info, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> pass content to 'long_description' -> use in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for long description and specifies package info, dependencies, and metadata. No user input, external data, or suspicious code execution paths are present. The dependencies listed ('construct', 'tabulate') are common packages and do not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
