  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project with setuptools, reading README.md for long description and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Reads static file and passes static metadata to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local README.md file and calls setuptools.setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic or malicious code, no external data sources beyond the README, and no suspicious behaviors. The dependencies are common packages. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident. All signals indicate a benign, well-formed setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
