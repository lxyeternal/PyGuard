  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup.py script, with no malicious behavior, no data leaks, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is a typical setup script, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly identifies the code as standard setup configuration, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis aligns with the previous ones, noting the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, which are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the others, confirming no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code simply reads a README file and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static metadata and dependencies.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. The code is a standard setup script with no security concerns.",
