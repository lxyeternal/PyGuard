  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a simple import statement.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No logical errors or suspicious reasoning. The report correctly states that the snippet alone doesn't indicate malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.6, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2. Given the minimal code, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The securityRisk of 0.2 might be slightly high considering the code's triviality; perhaps 0.1 is more fitting unless context suggests otherwise.\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?** No, the code is benign. The risk score should be lower, around 0.1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0. This is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.7, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1. Given the minimal code, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score?** 0.1 is reasonable; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0. All appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are slightly inconsistent: some are at 0.1 or 0.2, but given the code's simplicity, a uniform low risk (~0.1) would be more consistent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware scores:** Keep at 0 for all, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly at 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Should be uniformly low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that these are benign import statements with no immediate security concerns.",
