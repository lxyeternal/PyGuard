  "purpose": "Import the AccessParser class from the access_parser.access_parser module, likely for parsing access logs or permissions.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the only source, importing code from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with no further logic; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement importing AccessParser. No input/output operations, data handling, or code execution occurs here. The module and class names suggest functionality related to access parsing, but no malicious activity can be inferred solely from this line. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward import with no malicious intent or security concerns evident.",
