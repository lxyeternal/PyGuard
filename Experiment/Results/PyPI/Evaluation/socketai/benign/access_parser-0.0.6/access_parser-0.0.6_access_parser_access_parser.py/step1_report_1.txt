{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and analyze Microsoft Access database (.mdb) files, extracting table schemas, data, and metadata for inspection and potentially further processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads database file data through the read_db_file() function, and parses header, pages, and table data structures directly from the loaded binary data.",
  "sinks": "Data is parsed into Python data structures and printed via tabulate. No explicit sinks in terms of network transmission or external storage are evident. File reading occurs at the start.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file read into parsing functions, extracting headers, pages, tables, and data records. No external data sinks or network connections are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code performs standard parsing of binary data, with logging for errors and warnings. No obfuscated or misleading code features detected. Use of standard libraries and no dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads and parses a database file, extracting structural and data information. It uses established parsing libraries and handles potential parsing errors gracefully. No code indicates malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code is focused on reading, interpreting, and printing data from a known format. There are no signs of hidden or malicious logic, such as code injection, data theft, or system sabotage. All functions perform transparent, well-understood tasks related to data parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, specialized parser for Microsoft Access database files, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles data parsing and logging with no suspicious or malicious operations observed.",
