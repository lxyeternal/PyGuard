  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, feature-rich Azure storage utility library with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious sabotage. The main concern is the use of pickle, which should be handled carefully with untrusted data, but this is a common pattern. The security risk score of 0.2 is justified. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for cloud data operations."
