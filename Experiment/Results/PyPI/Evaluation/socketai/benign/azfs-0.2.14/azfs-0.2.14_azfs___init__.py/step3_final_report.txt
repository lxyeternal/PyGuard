  "purpose": "Module setup for azfs package, importing classes/functions, defining version info, and exporting symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from azfs modules and local modules, version tuple, and version string creation.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; purely static import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard module initialization code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version tuple and string creation, and __all__ declaration. It does not process runtime data, handle untrusted inputs, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The code is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or setup module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals and patterns are consistent with benign, standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No further action or concern is necessary.",
