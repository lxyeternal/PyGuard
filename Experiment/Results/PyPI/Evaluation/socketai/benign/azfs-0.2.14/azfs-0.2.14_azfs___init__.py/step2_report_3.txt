  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is mainly import statements and package metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data flows are present.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; standard version string creation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no suspicious activity or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is straightforward package setup with no data flows or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, highlights that the code is mainly imports, versioning, and export setup, with no external data processing or malicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same observations: standard module initialization, no suspicious behavior, no data sinks or flows.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous analyses; the code is purely import/export setup with no evident malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a typical Python package `__init__.py` or setup module, importing classes/functions, defining version info, and specifying exports.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security Risks:** No external data processing, no secrets, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports appropriately assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (or 0, indicating no risk)\n\nThe assessments are consistent with the code's nature. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward package setup code with no malicious or security concern indicators. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
