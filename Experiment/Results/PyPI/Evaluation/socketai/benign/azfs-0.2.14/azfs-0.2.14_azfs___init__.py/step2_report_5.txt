  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, primarily involving imports, versioning, and export definitions.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All scores assigned are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code only imports modules, sets version info, and defines `__all__`. No signs of issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n- No dynamic code, eval, exec, or similar constructs.\n- No external inputs or untrusted data sources.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent in their reasoning, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n- No errors or flawed logic are evident.\n\n**3. Scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since the code is benign, scores > 0.5 are unjustified.\n- The reports correctly assign zero scores, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity or indicators are present.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n- Scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard package setup.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code's simplicity and standard structure make it unlikely to hide malicious intent.\n- The import statements and versioning are typical for Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **All reports are accurate and consistent in their assessments.**\n- **No modifications needed to the scores or conclusions.**\n- **The code is benign, with no security risks or malware.**\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0                      |\n\nThis aligns with the code's straightforward nature and the detailed analysis provided.",
