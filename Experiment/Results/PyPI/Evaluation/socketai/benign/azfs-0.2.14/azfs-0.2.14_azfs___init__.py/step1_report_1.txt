  "purpose": "This code primarily imports modules and defines package metadata and exports for a Python package related to Azure file storage and table storage.",
  "sources": "Imports from azfs.az_file_client, azfs.az_file_system, azfs.utils, and .table_storage modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sink points where untrusted data is processed or executed; code primarily involves imports and metadata definition.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The VERSION tuple and __version__ string generation are standard. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, version information setup, and the definition of __all__ for exports. All actions are standard for package initialization or module setup, with no malicious or suspicious activity observed. No external inputs, untrusted data processing, or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports modules and defines package metadata. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
