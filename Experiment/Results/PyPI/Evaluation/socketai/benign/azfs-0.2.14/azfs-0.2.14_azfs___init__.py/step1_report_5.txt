{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various classes and functions related to file and table storage management, likely for cloud storage operations.",
  "sources": "The code sources data or functionality from imported modules: azfs.az_file_client, azfs.az_file_system, azfs.utils, and .table_storage. There are no explicit data input points such as user input, network data, or environment variables in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks such as database queries, network transmissions, or file writes. It mainly defines imports and an attribute (__version__).",
  "flows": "There are no evident data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet; it primarily sets up module exports and versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is straightforward with standard import statements, version assignment, and __all__ export list. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from multiple modules, defines a version tuple, creates a version string, and specifies public API exports via __all__. There are no input handling, no data processing, and no network or file operations demonstrated here. The code structure is typical for a Python module intended to expose certain classes and functions. There is no suspicious or malicious activity evident in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly manages imports and exports, serving as an interface for other parts of the package. No malware indicators or security concerns are present.",
