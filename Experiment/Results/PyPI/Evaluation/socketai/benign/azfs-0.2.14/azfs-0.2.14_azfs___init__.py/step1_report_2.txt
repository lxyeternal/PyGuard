{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export classes and functions related to file system and storage utilities, likely for use in larger applications or modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from azfs.az_file_client, azfs.az_file_system, azfs.utils, and local modules (.table_storage). No user input or external data read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet; no data processing, storage, or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines constants, without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The versioning is standard, and all exports are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, constant definitions, and an __all__ declaration for module exports. There are no runtime data operations, no untrusted input handling, or any suspicious code constructs. The version tuple is standard, and the import sources seem to be part of a library or package related to Azure file and storage management. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for exporting classes and functions. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module initialization file.",
