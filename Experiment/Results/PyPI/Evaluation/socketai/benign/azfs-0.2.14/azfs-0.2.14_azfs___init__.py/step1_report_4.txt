{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module exports and versioning information for a Python package related to Azure file system and table storage interactions.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules (azfs.az_file_client, azfs.az_file_system, azfs.utils, and .table_storage) which are sources of data and functionality.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit data sinks, such as network calls, file writes, or data serialization; it primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines constants and import/export lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The version string is generated from a tuple, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module-level exports and versioning. It imports various components necessary for Azure file and table storage operations but does not execute any untrusted data processing or sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's init or setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly defines exports and version info, which do not pose security concerns.",
