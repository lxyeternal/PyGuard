  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, standard, with no malicious behavior. It notes proper use of base64 encoding/decoding, no hardcoded secrets, and standard SDK usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is appropriate given the benign nature. Malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. No obfuscation detected. The high confidence is justified.\n- **Verdict:** The report is reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes standard SDK usage, proper encoding, and no suspicious activity. It notes no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is acceptable, reflecting minimal potential concern but no actual malicious activity. Malware remains 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, consistent with previous reports. No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, with a note that `get_file_client_from_path` is called but not defined here—potential dependency concern. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The potential dependency on external methods is noted but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk score remains low.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, standard SDK usage, proper encoding, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The scores are appropriate given the benign analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9), justified by consistent analysis.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0.15 (average of 0.1 and 0.2, considering the overall benign nature)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
