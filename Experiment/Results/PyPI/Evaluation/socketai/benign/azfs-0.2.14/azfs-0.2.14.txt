The main concern is the use of pickle, which should be handled carefully with untrusted data, but this is a common pattern. The security risk score of 0.2 is justified. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for cloud data operations."

The low security risk score appropriately reflects the minimal inherent risks, primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is typical for storage APIs. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
