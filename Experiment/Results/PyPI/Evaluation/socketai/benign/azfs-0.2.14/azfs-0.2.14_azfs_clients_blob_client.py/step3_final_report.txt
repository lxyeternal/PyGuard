{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around Azure SDK for Blob Storage, providing methods to list, get, put, delete blobs and containers.",
  "sources": "External inputs such as account_url, connection_string, file_system, file_path, data, and kwargs passed to methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure SDK methods like get_blob_client, upload_blob, download_blob, delete_blob, which interact with Azure Blob Storage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK client creation and method calls, leading to storage operations without additional validation or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Lack of input validation noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an Azure Blob Storage client interface, wrapping SDK calls. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The use of external inputs without validation is a security concern but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to potential misuse if inputs are malicious. The code's purpose is benign, and the overall assessment indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Azure Blob Storage client wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk reflects potential misuse due to lack of input validation but does not constitute malicious activity.",
