  "purpose": "This code provides an implementation of a client interface for interacting with Azure Blob Storage, including methods to get, put, delete, and list blobs and containers.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as account_url, connection_string, file_system, file_path, data, and optional kwargs; calls to Azure SDK methods.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK BlobClient and ContainerClient methods such as download_blob, upload_blob, delete_blob, get_blob_properties, and list_blobs that perform storage operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) flow into Azure SDK method calls (sinks), such as download_blob and upload_blob, to perform file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable names. No network connections or data exfiltration observed. Methods mainly invoke Azure SDK functions.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a storage client wrapper around Azure Blob Storage SDK. It uses parameters provided by the user to interact with blobs and containers. No suspicious logic or unusual behavior is evident. No malicious code, backdoors, or privacy violations are detected. The code does not include network communication outside of Azure SDK calls, nor does it process untrusted data in a malicious way. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or environment variables are present. All methods are straightforward and rely on Azure SDK functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign Azure Blob Storage client implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on this code alone.",
