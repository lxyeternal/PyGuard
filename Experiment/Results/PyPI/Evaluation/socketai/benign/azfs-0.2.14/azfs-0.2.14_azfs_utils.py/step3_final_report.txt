  "purpose": "The code provides URL decoding for Azure Blob Storage paths and filters file paths based on directory structure using regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern matching on input URLs and file path lists; pattern validation in add_pattern method.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems, perform network calls, or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input URL or file path -> regex matching and pattern decoding -> filtered file list or path components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard regex and exception handling; no obfuscated or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for decoding Azure Blob Storage URLs and filtering file paths. It employs standard regex patterns for URL parsing, with validation in pattern extension. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions are well-structured, and exception handling is appropriate. No external system calls or data exfiltration are present. The regex patterns are safe and typical for URL parsing. Overall, the code is safe and reliable for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for URL decoding and path filtering. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The current security scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
