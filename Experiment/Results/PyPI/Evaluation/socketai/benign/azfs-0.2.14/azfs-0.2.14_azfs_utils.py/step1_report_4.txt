{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality to decode Azure Blob Storage URLs and filter file paths within storage containers.",
  "sources": "Reads input paths (URL strings) in the BlobPathDecoder class constructor and decode method; reads file_path_list and parent_path in _ls_file_and_folder_filter function.",
  "sinks": "None directly; functions process data but do not write untrusted data to sensitive outputs or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Input URL passed to BlobPathDecoder.decode() → matches regex patterns to extract storage account info; file_path_list processed to filter and return specific paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration observed. The code appears straightforward in URL parsing and filtering logic.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements URL pattern matching and path filtering with regex. It validates patterns and raises specific errors for invalid input. No suspicious code paths or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no obfuscated segments, no dynamic execution, or external data leaks. The only potential concern might be if the regex patterns are too permissive or improperly validated, but they seem aligned with typical URL structures. Overall, the code performs standard URL parsing and path filtering without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for URL decoding and path filtering in Azure Blob Storage contexts. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It appears safe and purposeful for its intended function.",
