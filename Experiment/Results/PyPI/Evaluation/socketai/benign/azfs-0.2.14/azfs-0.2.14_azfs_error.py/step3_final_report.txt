  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in an Azure File System (Azfs) module.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs, network calls, or file operations; static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code consists solely of class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with static messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with optional message overrides. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is standard, with predefined messages for specific error types. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is static and purely for error handling, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
