  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling related to an Azure File System (Azfs).\n- No external data inputs, no network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution.\n- Exception classes include default messages and optional message overrides.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions, with no external dependencies or suspicious behavior.  \n  **Yes, the issues are not present.**\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not identify any logical flaws or mistakes in the code.\n\n### Scores and justifications:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, appropriate given the benign code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware score** is correctly 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- The **risk score** is 0, which is justified because the code is purely defining exception classes.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that defining exception classes is harmless, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about external data or dynamic code execution are made, which is correct.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and the scores are justified. No changes needed. The code is benign and typical for error handling in Python modules.",
