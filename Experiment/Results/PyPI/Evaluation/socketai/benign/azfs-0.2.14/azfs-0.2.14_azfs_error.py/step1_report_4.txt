{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an application, specifically related to AZFS (possibly a filesystem or storage framework).",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior. The class definitions follow standard Python exception practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for handling errors related to AZFS. There are no input reading, data handling, or output operations. No hardcoded credentials, environment variables, network calls, or malicious code structures are present. The MESSAGE constants are straightforward and contain no sensitive information. Overall, the code is typical of an error handling module with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code structures, and no security risks. It is safe and serves as part of an error handling framework.",
