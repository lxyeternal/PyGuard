{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an Azure File System (Azfs) module with specific error types for input, path, decorator errors, and format/size/return type validations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class variables; constructor method (__init__) and __str__ method",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; no user input handling, no external data reads, no network or file system interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exception classes and constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with predefined messages for various custom errors. The constructor allows optional message override. No external inputs, data processing, or network interactions are present. The structure is straightforward, standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
