  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely defining custom exception classes.\n   - There are no external data inputs, network calls, or file operations.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and adheres to standard Python exception class patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No report mentions any code anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns, which aligns with the code content.\n   - No issues or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero.\n   - This is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators, this is justified.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior or payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions; they base conclusions solely on code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code content.\n   - No discrepancies or inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The consistent zero scores across all reports are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No security risks or malicious intent detected.\n- Scores are correctly assigned.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, and no further action or concern is warranted.",
