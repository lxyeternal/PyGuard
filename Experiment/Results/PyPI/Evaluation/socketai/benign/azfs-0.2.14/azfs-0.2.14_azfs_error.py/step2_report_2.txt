  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for an Azfs module.\n- No external data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- Exception classes contain predefined messages, with optional message overrides.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No flaws are evident; the code is standard for exception class definitions.\n- The messages are static and appropriate for their respective error types.\n- Constructor design allows optional message override, which is common.\n\n### Scoring Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, scores of 0 are justified.\n- The code's purpose is purely defining exception classes; no external inputs or data processing are involved.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n- The exception classes are well-structured and follow standard Python practices.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring. The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
