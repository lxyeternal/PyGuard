  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, considering the code and the reasoning provided.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no external data inputs, no data flows, and no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1.0`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is just exception class definitions with no external data handling or execution, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n   - The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis provided.\n   - The uniformity across reports reflects the same understanding.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- The analysis in all reports is accurate and consistent.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive review and the nature of the code.",
