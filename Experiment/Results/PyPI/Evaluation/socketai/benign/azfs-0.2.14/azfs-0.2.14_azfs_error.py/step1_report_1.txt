{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an Azure File System (Azfs) module to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializations; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely defining classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive messages. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data. It adheres to typical exception class patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling within a module. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.",
