  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an AZFS-related application, providing specific error types and messages.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points where untrusted data flows or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink pathways present in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The exception classes are straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. These classes include optional message handling and default messages for specific error conditions related to file format, size matching, and return types. There are no data inputs, external dependencies, or network interactions. The structure and content are standard for error handling in Python. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application focused on error management.",
