{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an AZFS (possibly a filesystem or data processing) module, including error types related to input, path, and decorator-related issues.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code only defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is solely class definitions and constant assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard Python class inheritance and exception patterns with no unusual constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for error handling, with message attributes and straightforward initializations. No external data, network, or system commands are invoked. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The classes serve as structured error types for a larger application context, and they appear typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of custom exception classes intended for error handling within an application. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clean, clear, and typical for exception class definitions.",
