{
  "purpose": "Provides a client abstraction layer for Azure storage services (Blob, Data Lake, Queue) and a line-based reader for files stored in Azure.",
  "sources": "External SDK methods such as 'client.info()' and 'client.get()' for retrieving metadata and data from Azure storage.",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval via 'client.get()' which could potentially lead to data leaks if external SDKs are malicious, but within this code, no direct data sink is present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from instantiating clients with credentials, calling 'get_client' with a storage type, then using 'get' and 'info' methods to access data, and reading lines via 'TextReader'.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of validation for 'account_kind' parameter in 'get_client', which could cause runtime errors; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Azure storage client wrapper and line reader, relying on external SDK classes. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The only minor concern is missing validation for 'account_kind', which could lead to runtime errors but not security issues. External dependencies are assumed to be standard SDKs; their security is outside this snippet's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, well-structured, and free from malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minimal concerns, primarily related to external dependencies and lack of input validation. No malware detected.",
