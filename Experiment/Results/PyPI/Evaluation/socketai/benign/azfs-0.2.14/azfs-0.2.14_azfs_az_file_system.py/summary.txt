  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an Azure Blob Storage filesystem interface with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the risk score appropriately reflects typical cloud storage code. No adjustments are necessary."
