{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for managing Azure Data Lake storage, including creating, retrieving, uploading, and deleting files and containers.",
  "sources": "Data read from parameters such as account_url, connection_string, file_path, and data content.",
  "sinks": "Methods interacting with Azure SDK that send data to Azure services; no external untrusted sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (account_url, connection_string, file_path, data) flow into SDK client methods for storage operations; data is uploaded in chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or suspicious code. The only notable aspect is chunked upload logic, which is standard. No backdoors or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly uses Azure SDK methods for managing Data Lake storage, with proper separation of concerns. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution detected. No suspicious network or data exfiltration activities. Uploading large files in chunks is a known pattern. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code structure is straightforward and follows Azure SDK usage conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Azure Data Lake storage client interactions without any malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It performs typical file operations safely.",
