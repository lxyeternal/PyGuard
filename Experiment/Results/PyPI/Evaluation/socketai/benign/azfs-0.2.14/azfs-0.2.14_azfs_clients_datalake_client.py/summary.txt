  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of Azure Data Lake Storage client operations with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the minimal inherent risks, primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is typical for storage APIs. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
