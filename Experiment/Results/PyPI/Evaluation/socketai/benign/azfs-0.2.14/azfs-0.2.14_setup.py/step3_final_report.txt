  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project, reading version info, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from '__init__.py' using 'eval', reads 'README.md' for description.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or external effects.",
  "flows": "Version info flows from file into setup; no untrusted data flows beyond file reading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval' to parse version string, which is potentially unsafe if the file is tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor security concern due to 'eval' usage. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The primary risk is that if '__init__.py' is maliciously modified, 'eval' could execute arbitrary code during setup. All reports correctly identify this risk but conclude that no malware is present. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the risk score around 0.2-0.4 depending on confidence about 'eval'. Replacing 'eval' with 'ast.literal_eval' would mitigate this concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor security concern regarding 'eval'. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low but should be mitigated by safer parsing methods.",
