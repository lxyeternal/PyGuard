{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to missing content, but it appears to involve importing modules and possibly executing code, which could relate to data processing or execution tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data primarily from imported modules, environment variables, or possibly from external files or network sources (though not explicitly shown in the snippet). The initial import statements and potential usage of external data sources are the main sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include execution of functions, use of environment variables, or network operations if present, which could lead to data leaks or unauthorized actions if untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (from environment variables, external data, or network) could flow into functions, environment variable access, or command execution points, leading to possible security issues. However, specific source-to-sink paths are not clearly identified without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident; no obvious malicious code constructs like reverse shells, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are present. The structure appears standard; no unusual language features or dynamic code execution are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided code primarily consists of import statements and lacks clear implementation details. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior such as network connections, data theft, or backdoors. Without additional code, it appears to be benign, though incomplete. The code structure does not show any malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and benign, with no indications of backdoors, malware, or malicious data flow. More complete code would be needed for a thorough assessment.",
