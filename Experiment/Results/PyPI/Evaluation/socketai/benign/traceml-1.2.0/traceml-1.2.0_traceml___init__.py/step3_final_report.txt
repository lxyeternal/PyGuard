{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be minimal or absent, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading observed; minimal code structure.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are either missing or minimal, consisting mainly of import statements or placeholders. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies are evident. The low confidence scores reflect the limited information, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), indicating minimal concern given the lack of suspicious content. The assessments across all reports are consistent, cautious, and justified based on the available data.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and assign low risk and obfuscation scores. The confidence levels are appropriate given the minimal or missing code snippets. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
