  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform specific operations, likely related to data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external modules or files, though specific data sources are not explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs, but none are explicitly identified in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or function inputs to processing functions; however, without explicit code, detailed source-to-sink paths cannot be fully mapped.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code appears straightforward, with no unusual language features or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is minimal or absent, limiting detailed analysis. Based on the structure, it appears to follow normal coding practices. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are detected. Due to the lack of explicit code, the confidence in this assessment is limited.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the available snippet. It appears to be standard, benign code, but the assessment is constrained by the lack of detailed content.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
