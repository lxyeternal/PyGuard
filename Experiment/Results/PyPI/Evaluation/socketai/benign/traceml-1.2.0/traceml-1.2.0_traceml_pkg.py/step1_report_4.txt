  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the traceml library, including name, version, description, URL, author, email, and license information.",
  "sources": "None; all data are hardcoded string assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data inputs or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks or vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments containing package metadata. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could pose security risks. The metadata appears standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of package metadata with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is typical boilerplate code for Python package setup.",
