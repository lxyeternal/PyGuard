{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for traceml, including name, version, description, URL, author, email, and license.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with string literals at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. It lacks code execution, data handling, or external communication, and is typical for a package's __init__.py or metadata definition. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets beyond standard package info, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the traceml package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
