  "purpose": "Static package metadata declaration including name, version, description, URL, author, email, and license information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string constants; no input reading or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments without data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static variable assignments with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments defining package metadata. There are no inputs, data processing, external communications, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The code is typical for package setup or __init__.py files, with no indicators of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
