  "conclusion": "The dependency contains one potentially malicious component with obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting caution. The other components appear benign. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score of 0.6 justified by the suspicious patterns in Report 1. Scores are consistent with the observed code characteristics."
