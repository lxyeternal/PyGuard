  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely read from function parameters or variables, but no explicit input sources such as files, network, or environment variables are shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output, logging, or network communication; however, no explicit untrusted data sinks are evident in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flow details are unclear due to the absence of specific code lines, but general source-to-sink paths are not apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are detected. No unusual code constructs or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard Python constructs without signs of malicious behavior. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system interactions. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, and no suspicious code flow or obfuscated logic is present. The code's intent remains unclear but does not exhibit malicious or security-compromising patterns based on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indicators of malware, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage. However, the analysis is limited by the lack of context and specific code content.",
