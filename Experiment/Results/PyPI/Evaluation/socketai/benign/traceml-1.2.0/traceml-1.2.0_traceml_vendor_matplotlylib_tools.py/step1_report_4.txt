{
  "purpose": "Convert a matplotlib figure into a Plotly visualization by crawling through the figure object and generating Plotly-compatible JSON data.",
  "sources": "Imports from .renderer and .mplexporter modules, matplotlib.spines module, and the fig parameter (matplotlib.figure.Figure object).",
  "sinks": "Calling exporter.run(fig), renderer.resize(), renderer.strip_style(), and printing renderer.msg, which could output data or messages.",
  "flows": "The figure 'fig' flows into the exporter.run() method for processing, which communicates with PlotlyRenderer; optional methods resize() and strip_style() modify the renderer; renderer.plotly_fig is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The only unusual code is the dynamic addition of is_frame_like method to the Spine class, which is a standard extension pattern in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard imports and method calls to process matplotlib figures into Plotly format. The dynamic assignment of the is_frame_like method to the Spine class is a common technique for extending third-party classes, not suspicious. No data is transmitted over the network or stored insecurely. There are no obfuscated or malicious-looking code sections. All functions and methods are related to visualization processing. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious system calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for converting matplotlib figures into Plotly visualizations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The only notable aspect is the dynamic method extension, which is standard in Python customization, not malicious.",
