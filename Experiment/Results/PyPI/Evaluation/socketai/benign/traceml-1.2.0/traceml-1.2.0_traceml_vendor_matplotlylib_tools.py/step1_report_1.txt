{
  "purpose": "The code converts a matplotlib figure into a Plotly visualization and displays it, facilitating visualization in different environments like IPython notebooks.",
  "sources": "Import statements for PlotlyRenderer and Exporter, and the function parameters (fig, resize, strip_style, verbose).",
  "sinks": "renderer.plotly_fig (returns Plotly figure data), print(renderer.msg) (outputs messages).",
  "flows": "Input figure -> Exporter runs to extract data -> renderer gathers plotly figure data -> returned for display or further use.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically patches the 'Spine' class by assigning a new method 'is_frame_like' directly to the class. This modification could be used for obfuscation or to alter class behavior in an unusual way. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conversion process from matplotlib to plotly using the mplexporter and PlotlyRenderer classes, which are imported. The only notable unusual behavior is the dynamic addition of 'is_frame_like' to the Spine class, which may be considered an atypical modification but not inherently malicious. The rest of the code simply orchestrates the conversion workflow, with no external network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The print statement is only used for verbose logging, which is standard. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a visualization conversion utility with a minor unconventional class modification. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks; the modification appears intended for compatibility or customization. Overall, the code is safe.",
