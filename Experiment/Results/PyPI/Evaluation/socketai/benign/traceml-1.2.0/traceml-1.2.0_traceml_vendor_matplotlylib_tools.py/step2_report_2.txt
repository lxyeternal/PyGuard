  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues identified:** Dynamic patching of `Spine.is_frame_like` method.\n- **Assessment:** This is an unconventional but common Python technique for extending or modifying classes at runtime. No malicious behavior or secrets are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, minor unusual behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues identified:** Same as above, dynamic addition of `is_frame_like`.\n- **Assessment:** Similar reasoning; benign class extension, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with minor concern over class modification.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues identified:** Same class modification.\n- **Assessment:** Again, appears benign, a helper function for the Spine class.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues identified:** Same class modification.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, standard visualization conversion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues identified:** Same class modification.\n- **Assessment:** Unusual but benign; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily due to the dynamic class modification, which is a known Python pattern and not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a slight concern due to class patching, but justified as benign)\n\n**Note:** The dynamic modification of the `Spine` class is the only unusual aspect, but it appears to be a legitimate extension for compatibility or utility purposes, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate visualization utility with a minor unconventional class modification that does not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis.",
