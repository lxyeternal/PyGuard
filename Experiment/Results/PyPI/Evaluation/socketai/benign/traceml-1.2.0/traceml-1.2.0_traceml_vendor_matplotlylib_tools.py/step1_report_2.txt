{
  "purpose": "The code converts a matplotlib figure into a Plotly visualization by traversing the figure object and rendering it into a Plotly-compatible JSON format for display.",
  "sources": "Imports from .renderer and .mplexporter modules; references to matplotlib.spines.Spine; data accessed during the exporter run and renderer methods.",
  "sinks": "The function ultimately produces and returns a Plotly figure JSON object (renderer.plotly_fig). No direct sinks like network or file I/O are evident, but the resulting data is intended for visualization purposes.",
  "flows": "Imports are used to instantiate PlotlyRenderer and Exporter; exporter.run(fig) processes the figure object; renderer methods (resize, strip_style) modify internal data; final plotly_fig is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code redefines a private method is_frame_like within Spine class; this is an uncommon technique but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a documented conversion pipeline from matplotlib figures to Plotly visualizations. It leverages external modules (renderer and exporter) and modifies a matplotlib class method dynamically, which is unusual but not malicious. The core functionality involves data processing for visualization, with no evidence of data leaks, network communication, or malicious side effects. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malware patterns are identified. The code appears to be a legitimate utility function with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate matplotlib-to-Plotly conversion utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the dynamic assignment of a method to an external class, which is a common Python metaprogramming technique. Overall, it poses minimal security concerns.",
