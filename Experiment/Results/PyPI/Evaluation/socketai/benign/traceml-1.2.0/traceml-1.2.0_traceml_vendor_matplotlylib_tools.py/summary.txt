  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for converting matplotlib figures to Plotly format. The only notable anomaly is the dynamic patching of the 'Spine' class, which is benign. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The overall security risk score should remain very low, and the malware score is zero."
