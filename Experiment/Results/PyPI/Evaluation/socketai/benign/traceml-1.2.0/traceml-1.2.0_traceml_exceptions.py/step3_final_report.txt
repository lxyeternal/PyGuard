  "purpose": "Import an exception class from the polyaxon.exceptions module and create an alias for it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from polyaxon.exceptions module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks",
  "flows": "Import source to alias assignment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and aliasing, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of PolyaxonClientException and assigns it to TracemlException. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. The code is standard practice for exception aliasing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (mostly 0, sometimes 0.1). The code does not pose any security threat or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import and aliasing operation with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score remains at 0.",
