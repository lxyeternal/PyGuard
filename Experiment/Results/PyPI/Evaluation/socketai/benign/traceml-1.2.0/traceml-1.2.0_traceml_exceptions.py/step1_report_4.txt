{
  "purpose": "The code imports an exception class from the polyaxon.exceptions module and assigns it to a new variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from polyaxon.exceptions",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Simple import and reassignment; no unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports PolyaxonClientException from a standard open-source library and then assigns it to a new variable TracemlException. This is a straightforward aliasing and does not involve any untrusted data, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase that uses Polyaxon for machine learning operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import and alias assignment without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
