  "purpose": "To provide functionality for converting matplotlib figures into JSON format compatible with Plotly for visualization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: renderer, mplexporter, tools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup importing specific classes and functions. It serves as a bridge to facilitate matplotlib to Plotly conversions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no data leaks, or security risks evident in this minimal code. No complex logic, dynamic execution, or external communication present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initialization with no malicious intent or security concerns. It merely imports functions and classes to be used elsewhere. No malware or security risks detected.",
