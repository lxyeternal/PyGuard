  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module setup with import statements and a descriptive docstring.\n- No data flows, external communications, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Code presence of issues:**  \n   The code is purely import statements and documentation. No malicious or vulnerable code exists. Confirmed.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, mistakes in logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports' reasoning that the code is benign and standard is correct. No logical flaws detected.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions; the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard module setup with no security concerns. All scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
