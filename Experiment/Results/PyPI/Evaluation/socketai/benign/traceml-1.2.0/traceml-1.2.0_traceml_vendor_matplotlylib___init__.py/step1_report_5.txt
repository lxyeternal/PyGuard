  "purpose": "This module converts matplotlib figure objects into JSON structures compatible with Plotly for visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: PlotlyRenderer, Exporter, and mpl_to_plotly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only internal imports and module documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors observed; standard import statements and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a module docstring describing its purpose and three import statements importing functions/classes from local modules. There are no data input sources, no data processing, and no potential security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup module for visualization conversion without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that facilitates matplotlib to Plotly conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
