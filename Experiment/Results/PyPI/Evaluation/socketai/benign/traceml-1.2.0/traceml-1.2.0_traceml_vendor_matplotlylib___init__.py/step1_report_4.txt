  "purpose": "This module converts matplotlib figure objects into JSON structures for Plotly visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: PlotlyRenderer, Exporter, and mpl_to_plotly.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and classes but does not execute any data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains module docstrings and import statements from local modules. There are no data processing, user input, or network operations. It appears to be a standard, minimal module setup for a visualization library component.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple interface for converting matplotlib figures to Plotly JSON formats. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
