  "purpose": "This module converts matplotlib figure objects into JSON structures compatible with Plotly for visualization.",
  "sources": "Import statements for PlotlyRenderer, Exporter, and mpl_to_plotly modules/functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks are present; the code only imports modules and contains documentation.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or external data processing; the code is purely import and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module with a descriptive docstring and import statements. It does not process data, communicate externally, or handle untrusted input. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with scores consistent with its content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
