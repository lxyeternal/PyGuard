  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, managing dependencies, package metadata, and testing configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads from filesystem (README.md, pkg.py, requirements/dev.txt); executes content of pkg.py; uses exec() to load package info.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources or loaded data are directly used in a manner that influences untrusted execution or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and executes pkg.py without using user input or untrusted data; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run contents of pkg.py could be risky if the file content is malicious, but in context it appears to be package metadata. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static setup tasks: reading README.md for description, executing a local Python file to load package metadata, and reading requirements. The use of exec() on pkg.py warrants attention but appears intended for configuration, not malicious activity. No untrusted data inputs, no network connections, and no dynamic code execution beyond static exec(). All dependencies are standard and sourced locally or from known files. No malware indicators or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no apparent malicious intent. The only point of concern is the use of exec() to load package data, which could be exploited if pkg.py is tampered with, but under normal circumstances, it appears safe. No malware or security issues detected.",
