  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, loading metadata dynamically and configuring package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads static files (README.md, requirements/dev.txt), executes local 'traceml/pkg.py' to load package info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; exec() executes a local, presumably trusted, Python file.",
  "flows": "Reads files into variables; executes 'traceml/pkg.py' via exec() to set package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a local file for package info; no validation or sanitization of 'pkg.py'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks. The exec() call on 'traceml/pkg.py' is standard but introduces a potential security risk if the file is compromised. No network activity or malicious code is present. The scores across reports consistently show no malware, with the main concern being the exec() pattern. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The risk is low if the package files are trusted and maintained securely.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and typical for Python package setup. The only notable security consideration is the use of exec() on an external file, which could be exploited if the file is malicious or tampered with. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low, with a moderate caution due to exec().",
