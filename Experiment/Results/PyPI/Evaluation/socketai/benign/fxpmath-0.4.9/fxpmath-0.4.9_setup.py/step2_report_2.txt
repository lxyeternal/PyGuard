  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It reads local files (README.md and __init__.py) to extract description and version.\n- It calls `setup()` with static and dynamic metadata.\n- No external data, user input, network calls, or code execution are involved.\n- No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code based on the reports and the code itself.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; malware score should be 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; obfuscated code score should be 0.\n- **Security risk:** None; the code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n\n### Review of report scores:\n- All reports assign scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual behaviors are identified.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- It does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or include any obfuscated or hidden code.\n- The functions used are standard for Python packaging.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe Python setup script with no security issues.",
