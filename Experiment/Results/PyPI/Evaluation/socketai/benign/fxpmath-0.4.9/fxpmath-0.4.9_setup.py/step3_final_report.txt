{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the fxpmath library, reading local files for description and version, and invoking setuptools.setup() with metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; reads fxpmath/__init__.py for version number.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or code execution points.",
  "flows": "File reads from local files to variables, then passed to setup() without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, conventional setup script. It performs local file reads to obtain description and version, then calls setup() with static and dynamic metadata. No external network calls, code injection, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All scores should remain at 0, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
