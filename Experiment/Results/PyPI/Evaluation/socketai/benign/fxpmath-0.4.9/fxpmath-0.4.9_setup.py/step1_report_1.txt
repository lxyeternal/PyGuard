  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the fxpmath Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading __init__.py for version number.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> setting up package metadata -> preparing distribution files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README.md for long description and the __init__.py file to extract the version number. It then calls setup() to configure package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted data sources, no code execution, and no suspicious behaviors or hardcoded secrets are present. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard and legitimate Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
