  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py` script.\n- It reads `README.md` for the long description.\n- It extracts the version number from `fxpmath/__init__.py`.\n- It calls `setuptools.setup()` with typical package metadata.\n- No external data, user input, or untrusted sources are involved.\n- No code obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The operations are typical for packaging a Python library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code appears correct and standard.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Suspicious constructs:** None.\n- **External data handling:** Only local files, no external network or untrusted data.\n- **Obfuscation:** No.\n- **Hardcoded secrets:** No.\n- **Code execution or injection:** No.\n\n### Review of the reports:\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward, legitimate setup script.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify this as a standard setup script.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all observations are based on the code's actual behavior.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n**Note:** No further action needed. The code is safe.",
