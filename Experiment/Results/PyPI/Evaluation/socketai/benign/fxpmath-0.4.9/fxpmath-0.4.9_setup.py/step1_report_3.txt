{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'fxpmath', used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading __init__.py for version information, and static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or environment variable outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (__init__.py and README.md) into variables used in the setup configuration; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments detected. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the project version from a local file, loads a long description from README.md, and calls setup() with static and dynamic parameters. All operations involve standard packaging procedures with no suspicious or malicious activity. No external data fetching or execution of untrusted code is present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
