{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and package a Python library called 'fxpmath' for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description and reads '__version__' from 'fxpmath/__init__.py' to determine the package version.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses these inputs to generate package metadata; no untrusted data flows or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md and '__version__' file as sources, then passing the data into setup() for package configuration; no malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with standard setup procedures. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations, including reading files for package description and version. It does not execute any untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle user input. All data reads are from local files, and no code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The code appears clean and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
