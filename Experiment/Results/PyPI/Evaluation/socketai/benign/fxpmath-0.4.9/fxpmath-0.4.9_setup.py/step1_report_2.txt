{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'fxpmath' for distribution, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, reading __init__.py to get version information, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the script primarily reads files and calls setup(). No untrusted data processing or external system commands.",
  "flows": "File reading flows from disk to variables (long_description, _version), which are then used in setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code follows standard packaging conventions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script loads metadata files, extracts version info, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package info. No external data input, no command execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script without malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
