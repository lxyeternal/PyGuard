  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign test suite for the 'fxpmath' library, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all justified as zero. The code's purpose is purely for internal validation, and it poses no threat."
