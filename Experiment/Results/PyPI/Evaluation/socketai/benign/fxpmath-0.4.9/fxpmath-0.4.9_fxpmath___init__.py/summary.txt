  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a numerical Python library with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only issue is a minor bug in environment variable comparison logic, which does not pose security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1)."
