{
  "purpose": "The code implements a fixed-point arithmetic library for numerical computations, providing classes and functions to handle fractional fixed-point numbers with configurable sizes, formats, and behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input data from constructor parameters, string parsing functions, utility functions for conversions, and user-defined callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Data flows through internal methods for setting values, converting formats, and applying numeric operations; no external network, code execution, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are parsed and converted via utility functions, then stored in internal numpy arrays; data flows through methods like set_val, get_val, and various arithmetic operations, with callback hooks for extensibility.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious control flow detected. The code structure is clear, with standard practices for numerical libraries. Callback mechanisms are typical extension points and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured implementation of fixed-point arithmetic with configurable parameters, extensive input handling, and standard numerical operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity are evident. The utility functions and class design follow typical patterns for such libraries. The security signals are benign, and the code does not perform any external or unsafe actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe fixed-point arithmetic library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal risk score (0.1) are consistent with the detailed analysis. It is suitable for use in security-sensitive contexts, assuming utility functions are benign and user callbacks are trusted.",
