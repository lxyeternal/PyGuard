  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe fixed-point arithmetic library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal risk score (0.1) are consistent with the detailed analysis. It is suitable for use in security-sensitive contexts, assuming utility functions are benign and user callbacks are trusted."
