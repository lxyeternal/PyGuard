{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract callback class for handling events related to a fixed-point arithmetic object.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines a class with methods intended to be overridden.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only declares class methods with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears standard and contains no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple abstract class with callback methods that are intended to be overridden in subclasses. It lacks any data input handling, network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The license and comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a benign, straightforward design pattern implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic abstract callback class with no suspicious or malicious features. It does not exhibit malware characteristics, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
