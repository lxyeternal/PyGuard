{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract Callback class for handling fixed-point arithmetic events in the fxpmath library.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__) and methods (on_value_change, on_status_overflow, on_status_underflow, on_status_inaccuracy).",
  "sinks": "Methods that are designed to be overridden; no sinks that process untrusted data are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; methods are placeholders for callback implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for an abstract callback class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic abstract class for callbacks related to fixed-point operations, with no data processing or external interactions. It contains only method stubs intended for subclassing. No suspicious, malicious, or insecure code behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a callback interface for the fxpmath library. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
