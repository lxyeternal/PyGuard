{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract callback class for fractional fixed-point arithmetic operations to handle events like value change, overflow, underflow, and inaccuracy.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class methods are designed to be overridden in subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; methods are placeholders intended for extension.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; method hooks are meant for callback implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for an abstract callback class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple abstract class with four methods meant to be overridden. It includes a license header, which is standard, and does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious patterns. No source-to-sink data flows or unusual behaviors are evident. The implementation is typical for a callback interface in a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class for callbacks in a fixed-point arithmetic library. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
