{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract callback class for handling events related to fixed-point arithmetic objects, such as value changes and overflow statuses.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as there are no data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward abstract class with no external dependencies, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract class 'Callback' with methods intended to be overridden for handling specific events in fixed-point operations. There are no external data sources, no data processing, and no security-relevant actions performed. The class serves as a callback interface and contains only method definitions with no logic or external calls. The license and comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a benign and standard component of a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious abstract callback class used in a fixed-point arithmetic library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
