  "purpose": "Abstract class defining callback methods for fixed-point arithmetic events.",
  "sources": "Method parameters fxp_object, logs (optional). No external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; methods are placeholders for subclass implementations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; methods are empty and intended for override.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward abstract class with no logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple abstract class with method stubs for callbacks related to value changes and status events. It contains no data handling, network activity, or malicious code. The structure is standard for callback interfaces, with no obfuscation or security issues. The license is MIT, with no embedded malicious instructions. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of external interactions, data processing, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract callback class with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk features. The scores are consistent with its harmless nature, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score of 0.",
