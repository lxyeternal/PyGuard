{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract callback class for handling events related to a fixed-point arithmetic object.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines a class with methods.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains only method stubs with no implementation; no suspicious or malicious code detected. The code appears to be a straightforward abstract class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an MIT-licensed abstract class 'Callback' with methods intended for callbacks during fixed-point arithmetic operations, such as value change, overflow, underflow, and inaccuracy. All methods are placeholders without executable logic, and there are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or external data handling. The license is standard, and the class structure is typical for callback handling. No anomalous or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign abstract callback class meant for use in a larger fixed-point arithmetic library. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
