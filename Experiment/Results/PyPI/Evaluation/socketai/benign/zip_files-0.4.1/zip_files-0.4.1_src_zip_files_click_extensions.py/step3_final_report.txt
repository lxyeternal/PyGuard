  "purpose": "Utility module providing custom click options, logging activation, and help retrieval functions for CLI applications.",
  "sources": "Code reads command-line options, parameters, and internal configurations; no external untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network activity, or system modifications; primarily internal validation and help text access.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation in 'DependsOn' class; help retrieval function accesses command parameters; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines benign CLI utility functions and a custom option class to manage dependencies and incompatibilities. It includes a logging setup function and a help text retrieval utility. All functions operate on internal data, with no external untrusted input, network activity, or system modifications. The code is straightforward, uses standard patterns, and lacks obfuscation or malicious payloads. The global logging configuration, while potentially misused, is a common practice and does not introduce security risks. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module for CLI applications, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score reflects the general caution with CLI utilities but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use.",
