  "purpose": "Define custom command-line interface options and utility functions for click-based CLI applications.",
  "sources": "Input sources are command-line options and parameters processed by click.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raising errors and logging messages, but these are standard for CLI tools.",
  "flows": "Input options are validated in DependsOn.handle_parse_result; help_from_cmd retrieves help texts from command parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code detected. The code relies on standard logging and click functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom click.Option subclass to enforce option dependencies and incompatibilities, provides a debug logger setup, and generates help text retrieval functions. All functionalities are standard and intended for CLI utilities. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. No suspicious code flows or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements utility functions for CLI applications with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for command-line argument validation and help text management. The code is clean, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or suspicious elements.",
