  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, used to define package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads package configuration data such as package name, version, author, and dependencies from setup.py variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; setup.py typically does not execute untrusted code or handle user input during installation.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; setup.py is primarily a static configuration script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the file contains standard setup configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging Python projects. It imports the setup function from setuptools and calls it with package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. It neither reads untrusted input nor executes dynamic code based on external data. The script appears to serve its typical purpose without any suspicious modifications or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and performs its expected role in package configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this script.",
