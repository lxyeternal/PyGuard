  "sources": "No active code; only a comment indicating the file's purpose.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual code; no suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a comment with no executable statements or imports. Given the lack of code, there are no source-to-sink flows, anomalies, or malicious behaviors. The assessments in the reports correctly identify the benign and minimal nature of this code snippet. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk scores are slightly above zero (0.1), but given the minimal content, they could be lowered to 0 for a more accurate reflection of the negligible risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' evaluations are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate, though they could be slightly adjusted downward to reflect the trivial nature of the code.",
