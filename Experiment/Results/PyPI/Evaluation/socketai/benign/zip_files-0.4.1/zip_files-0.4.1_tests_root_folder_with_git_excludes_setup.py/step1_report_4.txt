  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used for packaging and distributing a Python project, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads static data from setup() arguments such as package name, version, dependencies, etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; setup() only processes static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py file used for packaging Python projects. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration in a typical manner. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The file appears to be legitimate and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and follows standard practices for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
