{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'zip_files', used for packaging and distribution of utilities related to creating zip files.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from './src/zip_files/__init__.py', reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description, and loads requirements lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could cause data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from the package's __init__.py; this value is used in the setup function to specify the package version.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard setup and packaging tasks with no unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for package metadata, constructs dependency lists, and invokes 'setuptools.setup' with package information. It uses safe file reading and standard Python packaging practices. No code execution, network activity, or data manipulation beyond setup configuration occurs. The code structure and logic are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected package configuration tasks without any anomalies or suspicious code. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
