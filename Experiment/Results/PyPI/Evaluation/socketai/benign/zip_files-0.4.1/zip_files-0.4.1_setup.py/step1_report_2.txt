  "purpose": "The script is a setup utility for a Python package named 'zip_files', used to configure package installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'src/zip_files/__init__.py' for version extraction, reads 'README.rst' and optionally 'HISTORY.rst' for long descriptions, and imports package requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified. No execution of external code or untrusted inputs occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and version information from static files; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code activities, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No code injections or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It reads version info from a specific file, includes static metadata, and defines package requirements and entry points. All file accesses are for configuration purposes and involve no untrusted input or dynamic code execution. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads static files and defines package metadata and requirements.",
