{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'zip_files', intended to facilitate packaging and distribution, including defining dependencies, package metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from a file, reads README and HISTORY files for long description, and specifies dependencies and entry points.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain untrusted data sinks; it primarily handles static configuration data.",
  "flows": "Version extraction reads from a file; setup parameters are set using static data and package information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata and dependencies, extracts version info from a file, reads documentation files, and sets up package configuration using setuptools. The only dynamic operation is reading version info from a specific file, which is standard. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The code structure follows typical setup.py conventions and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. It appears to be a benign and typical package setup script.",
