  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python utility related to creating zip files.",
  "sources": "Reads files ('__version__' line in src/zip_files/__init__.py, README.rst, HISTORY.rst), environment info, sys.version_info, package requirements.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no execution of untrusted data, network operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source file → uses setup() to define package metadata and dependencies → no data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads metadata files and package dependencies, extracting version info from a source file. The code is standard for Python package setup, with no dynamic code execution, network connections, or secret handling. The requirement lists include development tools but do not contain any suspicious entries. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code snippets found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to prepare the package for distribution, with no malicious or suspicious code present.",
