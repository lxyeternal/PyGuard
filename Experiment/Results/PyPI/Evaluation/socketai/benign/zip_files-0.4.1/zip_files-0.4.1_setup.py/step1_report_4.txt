{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up a Python package named 'zip_files' by specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "File reading operations ('__version__' extraction from src/zip_files/__init__.py, reading README.rst and HISTORY.rst). No external input sources or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not write or send data over networks or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads package version and long descriptions from files; passes static data to setup() functions without involving untrusted input or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The script performs standard package setup routines without dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard practices for Python package setup, including extracting version info from a source file, reading documentation files, and specifying dependencies and entry points. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is observed. It does not execute external code or handle untrusted input, and all operations are predictable and controlled. There are no signs of backdoors, malware, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution. There are no signs of malware, malicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities.",
