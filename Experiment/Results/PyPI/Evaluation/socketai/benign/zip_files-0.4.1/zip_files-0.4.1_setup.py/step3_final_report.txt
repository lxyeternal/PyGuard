  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, handling version extraction, reading documentation, and defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'src/zip_files/__init__.py', reads static files ('README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst') for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity, code injection, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static file reads and metadata setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static setup script with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static 'setup.py' script for packaging. It reads version info from a source file, loads documentation files, and sets package metadata and entry points. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All dependencies and metadata are standard. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is evident. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
