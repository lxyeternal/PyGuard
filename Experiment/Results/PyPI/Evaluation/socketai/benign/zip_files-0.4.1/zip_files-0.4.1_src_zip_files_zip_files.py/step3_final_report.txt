  "purpose": "CLI utility for creating ZIP archives from specified files with various options for compression and exclusion patterns.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for files, options, and environment variables (if any) used internally by click.",
  "sinks": "The call to `_zip_files`, which processes files and options to generate the ZIP archive.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow from command-line options into the `zip_files` function, then into `_zip_files` for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; reliance on external `_zip_files` is noted but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for a ZIP creation utility, delegating core functionality to `_zip_files`. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The input handling and options are typical and secure. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low (0.2 and 0, respectively). The main concern is the implementation of `_zip_files`, which is not shown; if that function is secure, the overall supply chain risk remains minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and well-structured, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified. To ensure complete security, review the implementation of `_zip_files`. Based solely on this snippet, the supply chain risk is low.",
