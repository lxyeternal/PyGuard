  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate. The main concern would be the implementation of '_zip_files', but within this scope, the utility appears safe."
