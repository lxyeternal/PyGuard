  "purpose": "A command-line utility to create ZIP archives from a specified folder, allowing various options for exclusion, compression, and output configuration.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line options and arguments, including folder path, exclusion patterns, output filename, and other flags.",
  "sinks": "The external function '_zip_files' which performs the actual zipping process; potential for untrusted data handling depends on its implementation.",
  "flows": "User inputs are collected via click options, validated, and passed to '_zip_files' along with the list of files from the specified folder.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface built with 'click' that gathers user options, validates paths, and delegates the core zipping operation to '_zip_files'. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. Input validation is appropriate, and no unsafe operations are performed within this snippet. The security posture relies on the trustworthiness of '_zip_files', which is not shown, but the interface code itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate. The main concern would be the implementation of '_zip_files', but within this scope, the utility appears safe.",
