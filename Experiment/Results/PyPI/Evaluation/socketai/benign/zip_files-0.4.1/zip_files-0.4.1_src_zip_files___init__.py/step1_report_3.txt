  "purpose": "This module appears to provide command line utilities for creating zip files.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a version string and an empty __all__ list, with no executable code, input handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is minimal, defining only module-level metadata: a version string and an empty __all__ list. There are no functions, classes, or executable statements. The code does not include any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. Given its simplicity and lack of executable content, there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard placeholder or metadata segment for a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and only contains metadata information about a command line utility for creating zip files.",
