  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided code snippet contains only module metadata: a version string and an empty `__all__` list.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious code, data flows, or potential vulnerabilities.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code snippet.\n   - The `confidence` score of 1 is justified, as the analysis is straightforward and conclusive.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious or risky elements, the overall `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` scores should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores because there's no evidence of malware or security issues.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions solely on the visible code snippet.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n   - All assessments correctly reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the simplicity of the code, the scores are appropriately low.\n- If future code includes actual functionality, input handling, or external interactions, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
