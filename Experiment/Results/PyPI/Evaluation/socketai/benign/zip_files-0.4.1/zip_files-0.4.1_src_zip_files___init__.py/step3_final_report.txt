{
  "purpose": "Module metadata declaration containing version information and export list.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; static code with version string and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment of version and export list.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, data processing, or external interactions; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining only a version string and an empty __all__ list. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external calls. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets indicates benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, metadata-only module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
