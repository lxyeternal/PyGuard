  "purpose": "Data models and event handlers for GitHub webhook payloads, enabling extraction and processing of event data such as repository info, pull requests, and push events.",
  "sources": "Raw payload dictionaries, URL parsing functions, and event-specific fields within the payloads.",
  "sinks": "Data attributes within class instances, methods returning parsed data, and label or ref extraction functions.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries are parsed into class attributes; methods access nested data to produce specific information like URLs, refs, labels, and commit SHAs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Use of 'yield from' in 'modified_paths' is a standard pattern, not anomalous.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data models for GitHub webhook events, with safe parsing, error handling, and no dangerous operations. It relies on standard libraries and performs no network or file operations. Multiple reports consistently identify the code as benign, with high confidence (around 0.9), malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The logic is clear, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of data models for GitHub webhook events, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
