  "purpose": "Configure logging for the 'whd' module, setting up a rotating file handler with a specific log file location and format.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'print_thread_id' parameter and environment variables indirectly through 'os.path.join'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes logs to '/tmp/whd_log'.",
  "flows": "Configuration function takes input parameter -> sets up logger and handler -> logs data to '/tmp/whd_log'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden backdoors observed. Usage of 'os.path.join' with fixed path is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard logging and os modules, then defines a function to configure logging for the 'whd' logger. It sets the logger level to DEBUG and attaches a rotating file handler that writes logs to '/tmp/whd_log'. The formatter used is from a custom 'ci.log' module, which appears to be a standard logging formatter. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The log file location is fixed but does not pose an immediate security threat. No secret or sensitive data handling is evident. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code sets up logging for a specific module with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It is a standard logging configuration with no apparent security risks or malware indicators.",
