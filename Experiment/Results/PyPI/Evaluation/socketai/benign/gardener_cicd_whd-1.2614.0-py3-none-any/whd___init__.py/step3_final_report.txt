  "purpose": "Configure a logger named 'whd' with a rotating file handler writing logs to '/tmp/whd_log' and applying a custom formatter.",
  "sources": "Static code defining logger setup; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "The log file '/tmp/whd_log' where log entries are written.",
  "flows": "Logger configuration established statically; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a standard logging configuration with a fixed log file path in '/tmp'. It uses a rotating file handler with a size limit and a custom formatter. There is no dynamic input, environment variable influence, or network activity. The code is straightforward and employs common practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The log file location in '/tmp' is typical but could be a concern if sensitive data is logged, though no such data is indicated. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The low risk score reflects the minor concern of log storage location but does not indicate any actual security issue. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, and their scores are appropriate.",
