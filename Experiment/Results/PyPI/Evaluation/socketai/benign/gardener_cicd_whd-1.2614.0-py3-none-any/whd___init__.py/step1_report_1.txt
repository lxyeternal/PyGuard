{
  "purpose": "Configure logging for the 'whd' component, including setting up a rotating file handler with specific formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (via os.path.join) for determining log file location; no direct untrusted input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The log messages are written to '/tmp/whd_log' via a rotating file handler.",
  "flows": "Logging calls in the application write data to the log file, but the code does not include any dynamic input handling or external data sources that influence the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard logging setup with no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger named 'whd' with DEBUG level, attaches a RotatingFileHandler that writes to '/tmp/whd_log', with a maximum size of 50MB and one backup. It uses a custom formatter from the 'ci.log' module. No external inputs or untrusted data influence the configuration. The code appears to be a standard logging setup with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging configuration for a specific component, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform suspicious actions.",
