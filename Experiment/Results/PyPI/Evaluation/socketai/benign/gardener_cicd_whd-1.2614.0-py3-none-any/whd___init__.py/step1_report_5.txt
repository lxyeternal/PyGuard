  "purpose": "Configure logging for the 'whd' component, setting up a rotating file handler with custom formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.path.join to determine log file path.",
  "sinks": "Logging output written to /tmp/whd_log file.",
  "flows": "Logging setup reads configuration, then writes logs to a file in /tmp directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of os.path.join with static path is normal. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and os modules, defines a function to configure logging for 'whd'. It sets a logger level to DEBUG, creates a rotating file handler with a static file path '/tmp/whd_log', and applies a custom formatter. The log file is stored in a temporary directory, which is common for temporary or debug logs. No user input handling, no external network connections, and no sensitive data processing are visible. The code appears straightforward and typical for logging setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code sets up standard logging with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply configures logging to a temporary file with rotation, which is common practice.",
