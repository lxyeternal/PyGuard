  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages webhooks, updates pipelines, aborts jobs, and triggers resource checks. No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is detected. The malware score is 0, and the overall risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data sinks. The dynamic config reload on errors is a standard resilience pattern.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0 is appropriate. Security risk = 0.2 seems reasonable given the external dependencies and config reloads, but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard CI/CD webhook handling, resource matching, and job control. No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk score is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The only minor concern is config reloading, which is typical resilience behavior, not malicious.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.2, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical webhook handler for CI/CD pipelines. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The threading is standard for async processing.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic matches the description. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, handling webhook events, resource checks, and job management. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's behavior is consistent with standard CI/CD webhook handling. No malicious indicators.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a standard webhook dispatcher, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Threading is used for concurrency, which is typical.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's flow and logic are consistent with normal CI/CD webhook handling. No suspicious activity.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree the code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected, all reports assign 0.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The scores are consistent and justified across all reports.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is a typical webhook handler with no malicious intent or security flaws evident from the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to external dependencies and config reloads, but no malicious activity)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.**",
