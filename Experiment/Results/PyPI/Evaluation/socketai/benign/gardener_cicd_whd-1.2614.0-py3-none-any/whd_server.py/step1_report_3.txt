  "purpose": "Define a Falcon web application for handling GitHub webhooks with error handling and logging.",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging, traceback, falcon, and local modules; function parameters; route setup.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any untrusted input data in HTTP requests processed by the Falcon app, especially in the webhook handler.",
  "flows": "HTTP request data -> GithubWebhook processing -> error handling and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation. Usage of external modules appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Falcon web app with a route for '/github-webhook' that uses a GithubWebhook class. It includes error handling that logs exceptions and returns a 500 error. No direct data handling or security-sensitive operations are visible. The code relies on external classes and configurations, but no malicious behavior or anomalies are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a webhook server with proper error logging. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within the provided code segment.",
