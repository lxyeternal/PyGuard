  "purpose": "Define and configure a Falcon web application to handle GitHub webhook requests with error handling.",
  "sources": "cfg_factory, cfg_set, whd_cfg (passed as parameters); no direct input reading from external sources in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks such as network transmissions or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up route handlers and error logging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Falcon app, adds a route for '/github-webhook' with a webhook handler, and sets up a global exception handler that logs traceback info and returns a generic 500 error. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input processing beyond route handling, and no suspicious operations such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of external modules appears standard, and the error handling avoids leaking detailed logs to clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a webhook server with proper error handling. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
