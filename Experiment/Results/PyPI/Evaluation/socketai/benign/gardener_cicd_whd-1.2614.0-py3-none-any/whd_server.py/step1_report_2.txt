  "sinks": "logger.error (logs traceback information), raise falcon.HTTPInternalServerError (error response).",
  "flows": "Errors in webhook processing trigger handle_exception, which logs traceback and raises HTTP 500.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious actions evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Falcon application for webhook handling, adding a specific route and error handler. It logs exceptions with traceback but does not leak sensitive information directly. No untrusted data sources or malicious sinks are present. The code appears standard for web service setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a web application setup for handling GitHub webhooks with standard error handling and logging. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
