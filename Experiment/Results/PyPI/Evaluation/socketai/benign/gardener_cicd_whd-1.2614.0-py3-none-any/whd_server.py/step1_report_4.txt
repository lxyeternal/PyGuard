  "purpose": "Set up a Falcon web application to handle GitHub webhooks with error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, configuration parameters, and exception traceback formatting.",
  "sinks": "Logging errors and raising Falcon HTTP errors.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in handle_exception are logged and then trigger an HTTP 500 response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns observed. No suspicious external connections or data manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Falcon app, adds a route for '/github-webhook' using a webhook handler class, and sets up an error handler to log exceptions and respond with a 500 error. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The logging of tracebacks is standard for debugging, and the overall structure appears consistent with common web service patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup for a webhook receiver with standard error handling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
