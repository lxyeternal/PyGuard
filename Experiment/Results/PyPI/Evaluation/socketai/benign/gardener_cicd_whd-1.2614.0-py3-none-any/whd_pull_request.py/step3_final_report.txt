{
  "purpose": "Handles pull request events, validates pipeline definitions, manages labels, triggers resource checks, and comments on PRs within a CI/CD environment.",
  "sources": "Repository files changed in PR, PR event data, external API calls to GitHub and Concourse, resource versions.",
  "sinks": "GitHub PR comments and labels, Concourse resource triggers, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "PR event data -> validation functions -> label/comment updates -> resource trigger functions -> logging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of time.sleep and random.randint for retries/delays, which are typical but could be misused; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CI/CD automation tasks for PR management, including validation, labeling, and resource triggering. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. External API interactions are legitimate. Use of delays is typical for retries. No suspicious patterns or data leaks are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CI/CD PR handler with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
