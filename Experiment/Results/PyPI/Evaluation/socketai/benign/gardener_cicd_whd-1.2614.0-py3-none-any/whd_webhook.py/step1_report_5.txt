  "purpose": "Handle GitHub webhook events, parse event data, and dispatch corresponding actions based on event type.",
  "sources": "req.get_header('X-GitHub-Event'), req.get_header('X-GitHub-Delivery'), req.media (JSON payload), req.get_header('X-GitHub-Enterprise-Host')",
  "sinks": "dispatcher's methods (dispatch_push_event, dispatch_create_event, dispatch_pullrequest_event), logger.info, resp.text",
  "flows": "Header data (event type, delivery ID, hostname) and media payload flow into event parsing and logging; parsed event objects flow into dispatcher methods; response text is set based on event processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data; no suspicious network calls or obfuscated code; use of standard logging and straightforward request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a webhook handler for GitHub events, extracting headers and payload data, then dispatching specific events to designated methods. It performs minimal processing and logging. No embedded or suspicious code patterns are evident. There are no external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies on imported modules for core dispatching logic, which are not provided here, but within this context, the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, non-malicious webhook handler with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected event parsing, logging, and dispatching without suspicious activities or hidden backdoors.",
