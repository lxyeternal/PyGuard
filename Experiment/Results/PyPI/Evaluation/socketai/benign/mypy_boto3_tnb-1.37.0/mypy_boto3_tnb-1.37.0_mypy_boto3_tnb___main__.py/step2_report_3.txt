  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It checks for the `--version` argument.\n- If present, it prints the version number.\n- Otherwise, it prints package info, including links and changelog.\n- The code uses `sys.argv` for input and `sys.stdout.write` for output.\n- No external data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or file operations are involved.\n- The code is straightforward, static, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.  \n  **Yes, the reports correctly identify the code as a simple CLI utility with no security issues.**\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. The logic is straightforward and correctly implemented for its purpose.  \n- **Code correctness?**  \n  The code performs as intended, with no errors or flaws.  \n- **Summary accuracy?**  \n  All reports accurately describe the code as benign and informational.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, possibly reflecting minimal inherent risk in any CLI script, but this is negligible here.\n\n### Justification of Scores:\n- The malware score of **0** is justified because there is no malicious code, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors.\n- The obfuscated score of **0** is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk score of **0** or near-zero is appropriate, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The code only processes static input and outputs static data; no vulnerabilities are present.\n- No assumptions about external data or dynamic behavior are made.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n- The overall assessment should be that this is a safe, benign CLI script with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal or zero security risk score.",
