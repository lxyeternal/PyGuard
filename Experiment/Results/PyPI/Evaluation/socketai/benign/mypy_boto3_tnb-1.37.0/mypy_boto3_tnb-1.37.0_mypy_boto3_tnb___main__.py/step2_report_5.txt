  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Logical Consistency**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line argument `--version`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations are present.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` simply write static strings to stdout.\n   - The control flow depends solely on checking `sys.argv` for `--version`.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n   - No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed beyond a simple argument check.\n   - No network activity, file access, or environment variable manipulation is evident.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports uniformly describe the script as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They consistently note no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), and the malware scores are 0, indicating no malware suspicion.\n   - The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0, with one report at 0.1), aligning with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Risk score**: Given the lack of any security concerns, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate. One report assigns 0.1, which is slightly higher but still very low; this could be due to conservative scoring or default assumptions.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - No discrepancies are apparent; all reports agree on benignity.\n   - The slight variation in the risk score (0.1) in one report is acceptable given the conservative nature of risk scoring; it does not indicate a real concern.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Final Scores**:\n   - **Malware**: 0 (no suspicion)\n   - **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n   - **Risk**: 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus.",
