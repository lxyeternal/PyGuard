  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about a specific Python library and its version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments (sys.argv) influences program flow; data is written to stdout via sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it checks for a '--version' argument and prints version info or general package info accordingly. It imports sys, uses sys.stdout.write for output, and defines simple functions with clear, benign purposes. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data handling, nor any network operations, file manipulations, or security-sensitive code. The structure and content align with typical CLI utility scripts. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script intended for informational purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
