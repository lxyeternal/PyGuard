  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code and the details provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that prints package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only `sys`, uses `sys.argv` for input, and `sys.stdout.write` for output.\n- The functions are straightforward, printing static, informational text.\n- No external data, network calls, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or backdoors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The reported issues (absence of obfuscation, no malware, no suspicious logic) are accurate.\n- The code matches the descriptions in all reports; no discrepancies.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and safe.\n- No issues found in reasoning or summaries.\n\n### Score Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0` (or very close, e.g., 0.1 in one report)\n- These scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 5 might be slightly high given the absence of any risk factors, but it's still very low and acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, a **malware score of 0** is justified.\n- The **obfuscated score of 0** is justified given the clear, straightforward code.\n- The **security risk score** could be marginally increased if considering the potential for future malicious use, but given current evidence, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Potential Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly assume no malicious behavior.\n- No hidden code or dynamic execution is present.\n- The static nature of the script and lack of external dependencies reduce the attack surface.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close, e.g., 0.1 if conservative)\n\nThe scores given in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The provided scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis conclusion aligns with all the detailed analyses and the code review.",
