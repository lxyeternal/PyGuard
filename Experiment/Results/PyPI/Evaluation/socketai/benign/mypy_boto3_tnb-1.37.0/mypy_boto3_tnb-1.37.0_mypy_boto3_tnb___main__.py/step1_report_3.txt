  "purpose": "Provides CLI interface to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs information via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no external or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in command-line input, then either prints version info or package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious variables or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and only interacts with standard input/output. It does not perform network operations, file access, or dynamic code execution. The functions print static information about the package and do not process untrusted input beyond simple command-line argument checking. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.",
