  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about boto3 TelcoNetworkBuilder, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input argument; sys.stdout.write for output messages.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing data to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv is checked for '--version'; outputs are written directly to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and mainly informational.",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments via sys.argv to determine if it should print the version; otherwise, it prints package info. No external data sources, network calls, or potentially malicious functions are present. No suspicious or unusual behaviors, obfuscation, or hidden logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It poses no security threats, malware, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and benign.",
