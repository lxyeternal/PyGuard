  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow. The code only outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script provides CLI interface functions: printing package info and version. It checks for '--version' argument to decide output. All data sources are trusted static strings, and outputs are sent to stdout. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data is processed. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed. The code is simple, straightforward, and only outputs predefined static data. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
