  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, and outputs information via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout, which is generally safe; no sinks involved in untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that prints package information and version. It reads command-line arguments, which is a standard input method, and writes to stdout. No data is processed from external sources or untrusted inputs beyond argument checking. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply provides package information and version output as expected.",
