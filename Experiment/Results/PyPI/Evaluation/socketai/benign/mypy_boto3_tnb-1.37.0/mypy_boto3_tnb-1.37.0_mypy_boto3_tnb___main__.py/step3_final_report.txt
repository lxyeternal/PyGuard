  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input; static strings in print_info() and print_version() functions for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting package info or version details",
  "flows": "sys.argv check for '--version' leads to print_version() output; otherwise, print_info() output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package information or version based on argument parsing. It uses only standard library sys, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external dependencies. The logic is simple, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero. The security risk score is very low, reflecting the static and informational nature of the script. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code's purpose is purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and minimal security risk. No modifications are necessary.",
