  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for the TNB service SDK, used for interacting with network functions, packages, and instances.",
  "sources": "Constants defining imported types and runtime version info; no external data input sources or untrusted inputs are processed within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; primarily data structure definitions and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows, input handling, or external communication flows are present; this code only defines data types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic. The code strictly defines type aliases, TypedDict classes, and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules, defines type aliases, and declares multiple TypedDict classes representing structured data for a network functions SDK. Conditional imports adapt to different Python versions, but no runtime logic, data processing, or external data sources are present. The code's purpose is to provide type safety and structure for SDK interactions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious intent within these type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a type definition module for a Python SDK related to network functions and packages. It contains no malicious logic or suspicious behaviors. It is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and data classes with no evident security issues or malware signals.",
