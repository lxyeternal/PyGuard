{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for a Python SDK interacting with a TNB (Telco Network Builder) service, including request/response types, metadata, and resource descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data via function parameters, environment variables (indirectly via sys.version_info), and imports modules like sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and internal literals.",
  "sinks": "Data is assigned to variables and returned as TypedDicts; no explicit data sinks like network calls, file writes, or command executions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and data structure declarations flow from source imports and parameter definitions to variable assignments and return statements within type declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be purely declarative type definitions with no runtime logic or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code provides extensive type annotations for a service SDK, including TypedDicts, Unions, and conditional imports based on Python version. No runtime code, network operations, or data processing is included that could be malicious. The only notable aspect is the use of sys.version_info to handle different Python versions, which is standard for compatibility. The code strictly defines data structures without any executable logic, command execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining types for a Python SDK for a TNB service. It contains no runtime logic, network calls, or malicious code. It appears safe and intended solely for type hinting and data structure enforcement.",
