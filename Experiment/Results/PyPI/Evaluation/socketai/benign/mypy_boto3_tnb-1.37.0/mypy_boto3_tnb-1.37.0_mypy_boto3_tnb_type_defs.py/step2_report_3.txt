  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine the presence of issues, inconsistencies, or security concerns.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code defines type annotations for a network management SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external outputs; purely data structure definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; standard use of conditional imports and type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, purely declarative, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (1.0), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role as type definitions for an SDK.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling.\n- Uses standard practices, conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the data structure definitions for network functions and resources.\n- No external data input, no processing logic.\n- No suspicious code patterns; standard type annotations.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely declarative code.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes type annotations for a Python SDK interacting with AWS-like APIs.\n- No runtime logic, external calls, or data exfiltration.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign, for type safety and data schema.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Summarizes the code as type definitions and data structures.\n- No malicious behaviors or external data processing.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK type definitions.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that this code is a set of type annotations and data structure definitions for a Python SDK related to network resource management.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely declarative; no runtime logic, external calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- **Consistency of Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a well-structured, standard set of type annotations and data models.\n- It uses conditional imports for compatibility, which is a common practice.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- The purpose is solely to enforce data schemas and type safety in a Python SDK.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a safe, standard SDK type definition module with no security concerns.",
