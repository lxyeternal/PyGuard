  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code to verify claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines type annotations and data structures for a network service SDK. It accurately notes the code reads from type annotations, constants, and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The code is declarative, with no data processing or external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets. The use of conditional imports based on `sys.version_info` is standard for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, purely defining data types, with no malware or security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining type annotations and data structures, with inputs from imports and constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling, just type definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; use of `sys.version_info` is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely declarative, safe, intended for type hinting.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes that the code defines types for SDK interactions, with no external data sources processed.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK type definitions, no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines type annotations for TNB SDK, with standard imports and type aliases.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely for type hinting, safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly summarizes that the code is a set of type definitions and data structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, well-structured type annotations, no security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, defining type annotations, TypedDicts, and constants for a Python SDK related to network resource management.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The code does not perform any runtime operations, network calls, or data manipulations that could pose security threats.\n- **Scores Justification:** Given the content, a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score should also be very low, close to 0, since this is purely type definition code.\n\n### Overall Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (benign, purely type annotations)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk or vulnerabilities present)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with all provided reports and the actual code content.",
