  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or suspicious elements, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines type annotations and data structures for a network service SDK, mainly reading from type annotations, constants, and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data sinks; data flows into structured TypedDicts.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. Use of sys.version_info for compatibility is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, serving as type definitions for a network management SDK. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign, standard type annotations. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, defining types for a Python SDK interacting with TNB services, with standard imports and conditional handling for Python versions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or data processing, only data structures.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; use of sys.version_info is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Strictly type definitions, no malicious code or external data processing. Safe and well-structured.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious signals. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, type definitions for SDK data structures, with no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns; standard conditional imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely declarative, no executable code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Benign. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines types and data schemas for a TNB SDK, with standard imports and no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK type definitions, safe and straightforward.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risk. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, extensive type definitions for SDK data structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely type annotations, no runtime or malicious code.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, well-structured type definitions. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a large set of Python type annotations, TypedDicts, and conditional imports for compatibility. There are no functions, runtime logic, network calls, or data processing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports indicate any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Given the purely declarative nature, absence of runtime code, and standard practices, the risk score should be **close to 0**.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, as no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation or hidden behaviors are evident.\n- **Security Risk:** Essentially none, as this is just type definition code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Adjusted Malware Score:** **0**\n- **Adjusted Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- **Adjusted Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for a Python SDK related to network resource management. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks exists.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify that this code is purely declarative, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores should reflect this, with zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
