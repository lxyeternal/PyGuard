  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that the code defines type annotations and data structures for a network management SDK, primarily reading from type annotations, constants, and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No processing of untrusted data; data flows are from sources into structured type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; standard use of conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, with no executable logic or data processing. It appears to be a well-structured set of type definitions with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** 1.0 confidence, malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar observations as Report 1, emphasizing the extensive use of type annotations, conditional imports, and absence of runtime logic or external data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns; the code is purely for type hinting and data validation.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the lack of external data input sources or untrusted data processing, highlighting that the code only defines data structures.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that the code is for type annotations, with no runtime logic or external data handling, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly benign, purely for type safety.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Summarizes that the code consists of type definitions, constants, and import statements, with no external data flows or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard SDK type definitions.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code Behavior & Logic:** All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, defining type annotations and data structures for an SDK. There are no runtime behaviors, external calls, or data processing logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports detect any obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security Risks:** Given the absence of runtime logic, data exfiltration, or external command execution, the security risk is negligible.\n- **Scores Justification:** The malware score is correctly at 0 across all reports, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is also 0, as no obfuscation is present. The overall risk score is appropriately low, given the nature of the code.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Adjustments:** No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Additional Checks:** Since this is purely type definition code, the main concern would be whether any imported modules or literals could introduce risks. All imports are standard, and no suspicious literals or dynamic code are present.\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no runtime logic, external data handling, or security issues)\n\n**Summary:** This code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for a network management SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
