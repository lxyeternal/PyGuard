  "purpose": "Define type annotations for TNB service-related data structures used in Python code, especially for interaction with AWS-like APIs.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and data structure definitions, including imported modules, constants, and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only defines types and data schemas, with no runtime data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only sets up data structures, no data flows or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected. The code strictly defines types and data schemas without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a Python SDK interacting with a TNB service, using standard Python typing constructs. It imports necessary modules, defines a large set of TypedDicts and type aliases, and does not perform any runtime logic, I/O, or network operations. There are no suspicious imports, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is consistent with typical SDK type definitions, with clear separation of input/output schemas. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK related to TNB services. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be purely for type hinting and data schema purposes, with no active behavior that could compromise security.",
