  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the claims are accurate and consistent with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines type annotations and data structures for a network service SDK, primarily reading from type annotations, constants, and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime processing or untrusted data sinks are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors; the code is purely declarative. Use of sys.version_info for compatibility is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign, well-structured, and solely for type hinting.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware or security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes that the code defines type annotations for a Python SDK, with sources being imports and type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. Use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely declarative, safe, and standard.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining data structures for a network functions SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors; the code is a set of type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines type annotations for TNB SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns; standard SDK type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining type annotations and data structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe SDK type definitions.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that this code is a set of type definitions, data schemas, and constants for a Python SDK related to network management. There are no executable logic, network calls, or data processing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports find any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The use of conditional imports and type annotations is standard practice.\n- **Security Risks:** Given the nature of the code—strictly type definitions and data schemas—there's no apparent security risk or malicious activity.\n\n### Final Justification & Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk; purely type annotations and data structures.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK related to network resource management. It contains no executable logic, no network or file I/O, and no malicious patterns.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
