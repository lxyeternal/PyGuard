{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and data structure definitions for a Python SDK related to network resource management, primarily serving as type hints for developers and static analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, constants, external modules such as 'sys', 'datetime', 'typing', and 'botocore.response.StreamingBody'.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data sinks or external data processing; purely declarative type definitions.",
  "flows": "Data flows into TypedDicts and type aliases used for static type checking; no dynamic data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It does not contain executable logic, network calls, or data processing. The structure is consistent, well-organized, and follows standard Python typing conventions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for a network management SDK. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and overall security risk also at 0.",
