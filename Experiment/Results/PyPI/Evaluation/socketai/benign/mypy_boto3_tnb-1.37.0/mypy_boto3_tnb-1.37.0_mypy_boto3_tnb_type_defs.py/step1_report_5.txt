  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for TNB service types and responses in a Python SDK",
  "sources": "Constants and class definitions, type annotations, import statements, docstring comments",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or external untrusted data flows; the code primarily defines types and data structures",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity; purely type definitions and imports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions, data structures, and imports for a Python SDK related to TNB services. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, standard type annotations, and declares many structured response types. The code does not include any network activity, system modifications, or dynamic code execution. All components serve as type annotations and data models, with no apparent malicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as type annotations and data schemas without runtime behavior or external data manipulation.",
