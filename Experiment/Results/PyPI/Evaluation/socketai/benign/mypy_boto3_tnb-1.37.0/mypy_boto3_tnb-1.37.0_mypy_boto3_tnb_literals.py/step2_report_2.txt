  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security issues, and consistency of scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a static collection of string literal type aliases for AWS resource names, states, and other identifiers.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or input handling is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The purpose is solely for type annotations and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literal types for AWS service constants.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Fully benign, no security risks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defines string literals for AWS types.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Same as above, safe, static, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, for AWS identifiers.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No anomalies, no dynamic behavior, purely static.\n- **Risk score:** The report assigns `securityRisk=0.1`. Given the code's static, benign nature, this seems slightly high. It might be a default or cautious estimate, but in this context, it should be **0**.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower `securityRisk` to 0.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as previous, defining literals for SDK annotations.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, for type annotations.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No issues, static definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** For report 3, a `securityRisk=0.1` seems unjustified given the static, benign nature of the code. It should be **0**.\n\n### **Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk, just static type definitions)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a safe, static type alias module for AWS resource constants. The reported scores are mostly accurate, except for report 3's `securityRisk`, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n**Overall recommendation:** No security concern. The code is benign and purely for type safety.",
