{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in the tnb service, including state and resource identifiers.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for string literals assigned to variables, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data processing; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code solely assigns static string literals to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, no code execution, no network activity, and no backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for string literals, conditionally importing 'Literal' based on Python version, and exporting a list of string constants. There are no dynamic or malicious code elements, no data handling, and no external interactions. The purpose is purely to provide type annotations for use elsewhere. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type annotation definition file for constants used in a larger codebase. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscation. The high-confidence assessment indicates the code is safe and solely for type annotation purposes.",
