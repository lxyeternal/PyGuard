  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS service constants, resource states, and identifiers used in boto3 stubs for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions used for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, or dynamic behavior; standard conditional import for 'Literal'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of string literal type aliases for AWS resource identifiers, states, and service names, with conditional import for compatibility. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or network interactions. The purpose is solely for type safety and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is an overestimation; the code's static, benign nature warrants a score of 0 across malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, static type alias module for AWS constants, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses no security risk and is appropriate for use in type checking. The scores in the reports are accurate, except the minor security risk score which should be lowered to zero for consistency.",
