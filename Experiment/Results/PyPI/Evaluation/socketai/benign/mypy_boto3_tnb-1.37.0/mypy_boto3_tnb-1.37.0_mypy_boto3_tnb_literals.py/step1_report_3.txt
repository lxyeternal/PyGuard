  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service-related identifiers for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string literals in variable declarations; no dynamic input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; all literals are predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code uses conditional imports for compatibility and defines multiple string literal types without any obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for specific string literals used in AWS-related modules. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. The literals are static, predefined, and serve as type hints. No user input, external data, or execution of dynamic code is present. No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns are identified. The code appears to be purely for type safety and documentation purposes, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions using string literals. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and aligns with standard type hinting practices.",
