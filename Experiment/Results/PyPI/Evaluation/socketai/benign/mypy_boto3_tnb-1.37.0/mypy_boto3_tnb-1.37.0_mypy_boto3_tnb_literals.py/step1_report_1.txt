{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for various AWS service-related constants, used for type annotations in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; no data processing or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of large number of string literals as type definitions; no unusual or suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal type aliases for AWS resource names, states, and other identifiers. The imports are standard and safe. No data input, external connections, or dynamic code execution is present. The primary function is static type annotation support. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a static type alias library for AWS service constants in boto3. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, safe, and intended solely for type checking support.",
