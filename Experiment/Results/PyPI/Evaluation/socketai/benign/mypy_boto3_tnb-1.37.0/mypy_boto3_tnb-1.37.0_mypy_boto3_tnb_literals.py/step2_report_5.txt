  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static string literal definitions used for type annotations.\n- Conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected.\n- The purpose is purely to enhance type safety and documentation support.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static type alias library for AWS service constants.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate).\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code as static type definitions for AWS literals.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate).\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report emphasizes the static nature and benign purpose.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.1, but given the content, this is likely an overestimation. The code is purely declarative.\n\n**Justification for risk score:** The code doesn't process untrusted data or perform any operations that could introduce security risks. The minimal risk score seems appropriate, though even 0.1 might be slightly conservative.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the code is static, purely for type annotations.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate).\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states the code is static constants for type annotations, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any actual issues in the code.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None detected. The code is straightforward, static, and safe.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None inherent in the code; the minimal risk scores assigned are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk close to zero.\n- **Potential adjustments:** The only minor point is the report that assigns a 0.1 security risk; it might be more appropriate to set that to 0, given the code's static and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities present)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, static type annotation library for AWS resource literals. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.",
