  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static collection of string literal type aliases used for type annotations in boto3 stubs.\n- It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No external inputs, data processing, dynamic code execution, or network interactions are present.\n- No secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a type hinting aid.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literal types for AWS service constants.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no anomalies, no obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 (security risk), 0.5 (malware), 1 (confidence)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is a benign type alias module. The high confidence and zero malware/security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining string literals for AWS identifiers.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no external data, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0, 0.5, 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the previous. No issues. The report's conclusion of safety and benign nature is correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, for AWS-related identifiers.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, no suspicious code, static literals only.\n- **Risk score:** 0, 0.5, 1\n\n**Additional note:**  \nThe report mentions a \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1, which seems slightly overcautious given the static nature. Since no external or untrusted data is involved, a 0.0 risk score is more appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is safe; the risk score should be **0**. The malware score remains correctly at 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literals for AWS SDK identifiers.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no external data, purely static.\n- **Risk score:** 0, 0.5, 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent. The high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to others, for type annotations.\n- **Findings:** No external input, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0, 0.5, 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The code is a straightforward static declaration. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior (score 0).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (score 0).  \n- **Risk score:** The only slight discrepancy is in Report 3, which assigns a security risk of 0.1. Given the static, benign nature, **0** is more appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The code is entirely safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The purpose is purely to provide static type annotations for AWS constants.\n- No changes needed to the scores, except lowering the \"securityRisk\" in Report 3 to **0** for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's static, declarative nature and the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
