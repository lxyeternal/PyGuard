  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims and assess the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS service constants, with safe imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious constructs; large number of string literals are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, purely for type annotations, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as a benign static type alias library. No security issues, obfuscation, or malware. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining string literals for AWS constants, with safe imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, safe, intended for type checking.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the report's conclusion aligns with the code. No malicious intent or obfuscation. Confidence level is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS-related string literals, with conditional import for 'Literal'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or dynamic code.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Security Risk Score:** 0.1 — this is slightly above zero, but given the code's nature, this seems overly cautious. The code does not pose any security risk; it's purely declarative.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is safe. The small security risk score might be an overestimation; it could be set to 0.0 for clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static definitions, with compatibility handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, benign, for type safety.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with prior reports. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines constants with conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, safe, for type annotations.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is a benign constants module. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a static set of string literal type aliases for AWS resource identifiers, states, and service names.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.\n- **Security Risks:** The minimal security risk score (0.1) in Report 3 seems unjustified; the code is purely static.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk; the code is static type definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a safe, static type alias module for AWS constants, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, though the minor security risk score could be lowered to zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**  \n- Confirm that all literals are as intended and not dynamically generated or imported from untrusted sources (they are static here).  \n- No further security measures needed; the code is purely for type annotations.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**No security concern.** The code is safe, benign, and serves its purpose for static type checking in Python projects.",
