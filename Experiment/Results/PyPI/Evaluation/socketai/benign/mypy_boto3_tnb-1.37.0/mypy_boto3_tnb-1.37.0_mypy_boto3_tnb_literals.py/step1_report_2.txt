{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various service, resource, and state identifiers used in AWS-related code, primarily for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for string types; import statement for 'Literal' based on Python version; no external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or output; the code only defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with static literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The license and copyright comment, along with the import statements and literal definitions, are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various AWS service identifiers, version compatibility handling for 'Literal', and a comprehensive set of string literal constants for use in type checking. No external input handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution exists. The code is static, straightforward, and typical for type annotation definitions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type annotation definitions for AWS service literals. It does not contain malware, suspicious logic, or security risks. It is safe and purely declarative.",
