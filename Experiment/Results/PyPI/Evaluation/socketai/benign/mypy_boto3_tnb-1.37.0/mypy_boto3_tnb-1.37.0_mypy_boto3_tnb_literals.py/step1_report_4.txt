{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS and related service identifiers used in type annotations for a Python SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals defining various constant values such as service names, states, and regions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or passed to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only declares constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to be a standard static definition of literals for type safety, with no unusual behavior, dynamic code execution, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. It defines a large set of string literal types for use in type annotations, facilitating type safety and code clarity. No dynamic execution, input handling, or external dependencies are present that could indicate malicious activity. The content is purely declarative and static.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward static declaration of string literal types for a Python SDK or codebase, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process or execute any untrusted data and serves only as type annotations for development support.",
