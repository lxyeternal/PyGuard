  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; code is a simple interface with documentation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward SDK interface. Slightly higher confidence (1.0), minimal security risk (0.1) possibly due to the future date in copyright.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity. The small security risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—simple import/export, no data handling, no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Basic interface module, no data flow or network activity, no obfuscation or malware.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar straightforward SDK wrapper, no malicious behavior. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, and the code is purely a wrapper for SDK components with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.1 (from Report 2), which is very low, reflecting minimal security concern mainly due to the future copyright date, which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n\n**Overall judgment:**  \n- The code is a benign interface module for AWS SDK interactions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:  \n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.05 (to reflect the minimal, non-malicious, and benign nature of the code, possibly slightly above zero due to the unusual copyright date, but still negligible)\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary to the scores; they are already appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary statement:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK interface module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors detected. The existing scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
