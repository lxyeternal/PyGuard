{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface and documentation for the tnb service, wrapping client and paginator classes for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator); code does not read external input data.",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; primarily defines imports and an alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code appears to be standard library and documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions from local modules to expose an interface for the tnb service. It contains a docstring with usage instructions and a copyright notice. No data input, network activity, or execution of untrusted data is present. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical interface module with documentation, no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It serves as an API facade and does not contain security risks or malware.",
