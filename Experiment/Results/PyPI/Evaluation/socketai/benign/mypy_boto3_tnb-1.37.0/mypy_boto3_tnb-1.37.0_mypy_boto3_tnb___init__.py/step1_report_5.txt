{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and imports for the tnb service SDK, facilitating access to various paginators and the client class.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), constants, and inline documentation.",
  "fires": "No untrusted input sources, data flow, or user input processing present in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The copyright date appears unusually future-dated (2025), but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of module-level imports, variable aliasing, and documentation. It references AWS SDK paginator patterns and defines a Client alias. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, or data handling that could be malicious. The copyright year discrepancy is noted but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward SDK interface wrapper with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured Python module for SDK access.",
