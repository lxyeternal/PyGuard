{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface and documentation for the tnb (telco network builder) service, mainly exporting client classes and paginators.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the docstring including usage example.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not perform any data output, network operations, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statements and docstring to module exports (__all__), with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward, mainly import/export definitions and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple interface module that imports client classes and paginators from local modules, provides a usage example within a docstring, and defines __all__ for exports. It does not include any input handling, network activity, or executable logic beyond standard imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code injections. The presence of a well-formed docstring with example usage and licensing info suggests legitimate intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a straightforward interface for the tnb service SDK components, with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior detected. It appears to be a standard, benign library interface module.",
