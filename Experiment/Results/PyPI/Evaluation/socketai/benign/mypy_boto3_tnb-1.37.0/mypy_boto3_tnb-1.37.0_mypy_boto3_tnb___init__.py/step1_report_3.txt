{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to the tnb (telco network builder) service, offering imports and type aliases for use with boto3 clients.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), string literals (e.g., documentation link, copyright), and session/client creation in example usage (commented).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; no data handling, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up type aliases and documentation; it does not process or flow untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The documentation link and copyright statement are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines imports from local modules, establishes a type alias, and declares an __all__ list for exports. The included usage example is commented and demonstrates typical usage of boto3 with no suspicious network activity or data handling. There are no code injection points, environment variable misuse, or other security issues. The code appears to be a straightforward module interface setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface module for a boto3 service client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely organizes imports and type aliases for ease of use, with no data processing or external interactions that could be exploited.",
