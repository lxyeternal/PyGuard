  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Provides main interface and documentation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: None observed; code is straightforward.\n- Analysis: The code is a typical interface module with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- Conclusion: No malicious or security risks detected.\n- Scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Main interface for the tnb service.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: Slight note on the copyright year (2025), but this is likely a typo.\n- Analysis: Static import and alias setup, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, straightforward SDK setup.\n- Scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the small security risk might be justified as a conservative measure, but given the code's nature, it's minimal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Interface to the tnb service.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data processing or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior; documentation link and copyright are standard.\n- Analysis: Simple import and alias definitions, no dynamic code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exporting client classes and paginators.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data handling or network activity.\n- Anomalies: No secrets or obfuscation; documentation is standard.\n- Analysis: Basic import/export module.\n- Conclusion: Benign SDK interface.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: SDK interface and import facilitation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: Future-dated copyright (2025) noted but not malicious.\n- Analysis: Standard module structure.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no indication of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's nature, this is reasonable. The only slight point is the securityRisk=0.1 in Report 2, which might be a conservative placeholder or default.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard interface module, importing classes and defining aliases.\n- No dynamic code, no external data handling, no network activity, no suspicious patterns.\n- The copyright date discrepancy (2025) is likely a typo, not malicious.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.** The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (default minimal risk for such modules)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments.",
