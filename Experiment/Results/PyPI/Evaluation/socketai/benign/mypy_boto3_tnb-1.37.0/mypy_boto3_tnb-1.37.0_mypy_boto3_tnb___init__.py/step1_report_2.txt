{
  "purpose": "Main interface for the tnb (telco network builder) service, providing imports and client initialization for interacting with AWS services via boto3.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the imported modules (.client and .paginator), which are local modules not shown here.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks, such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications. The code only defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from imported modules to variable assignments and the __all__ export, with no untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The copyright date is set to 2025, which may be a typo but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes a structured interface for the tnb service, importing specific classes and defining a Client alias. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors. All functions and variables are static and related to SDK setup. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward interface module for a boto3-based AWS service, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a benign setup for SDK access.",
