  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Interface and documentation for tnb service.  \n- **Findings:** No external data input, no network activity, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0.0, security risk 0.0, confidence 1.0.  \n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Main interface for tnb, providing imports and client initialization.  \n- **Findings:** No untrusted data handling, no network activity, only static setup.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0.0, security risk 0.1, confidence 1.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) possibly due to the nature of SDK setup, but no actual security concern. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Interface with imports and type aliases.  \n- **Findings:** No data processing, no network activity, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0.0, security risk 0, confidence 1.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Exports client classes and paginators.  \n- **Findings:** No data input, no network activity, documentation and imports only.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0.0, security risk 0, confidence 0.9.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; benign code.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** SDK interface and imports.  \n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no network activity, only static code.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0.0, security risk 0, confidence 0.9.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward SDK interface module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's static, import-only nature.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, with only a slight increase (0.1) in one report, justified by the nature of SDK setup but not indicative of actual risk.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the clear and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code does not pose security threats.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThe code is a benign, well-structured interface module for AWS SDK interactions. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
