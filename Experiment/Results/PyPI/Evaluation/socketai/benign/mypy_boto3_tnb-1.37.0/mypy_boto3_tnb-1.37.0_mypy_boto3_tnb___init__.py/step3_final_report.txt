{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface and documentation for the tnb service SDK, setting up imports and type aliases for client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules, no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Initialization of SDK client and paginator objects, purely static setup without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is inconsistent with current dates but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with static imports, class aliasing, and export definitions. It contains no dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in some reports likely reflects the placeholder copyright date, not a security concern. Malware scores are correctly zero, indicating no malicious intent. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and import-only nature. No modifications are necessary.",
