{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginators for the tnb service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from '.type_defs' module, and uses sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling, no network or file I/O, no execution of external code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from input type definitions to paginator classes and their paginate methods, with no external untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions, type annotations, and conditional imports. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type-safe class definitions for paginators, with conditional import for 'Unpack' based on Python version. It imports type definitions, and defines classes with paginate methods annotated for type safety. No external data is read at runtime; the code is static type annotation scaffolding. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code does not perform any network or file operations, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 paginators. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe and purely for typing purposes.",
