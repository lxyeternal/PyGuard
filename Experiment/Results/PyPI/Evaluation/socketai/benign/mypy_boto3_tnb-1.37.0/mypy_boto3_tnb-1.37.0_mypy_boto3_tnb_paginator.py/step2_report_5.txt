  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is for type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 TNB, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, defining classes with type annotations, no dynamic execution, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code appears safe and standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role in providing type annotations and paginator classes, with no external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, no dynamic code, no external data sinks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code defines paginator classes for boto3 TNB, with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, purely for type annotations, with no suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; the code is boilerplate for type safety.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Notes that the 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs, which could be untrusted input.\n- **Assessment:** While the **kwargs are passed directly to the underlying paginator, this is standard for such wrapper classes. Since the code does not execute or process this data beyond delegation, there's no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly higher risk due to passing untrusted input, but the code itself is safe.\n- **Justification:** The small risk score reflects that user input is passed to an external method, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's role in defining paginator classes with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, with no external data leaks or execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; the code is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 due to passing **kwargs, which is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n### Final Justified Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — passing user-controlled **kwargs to the paginator could be a minimal security concern, but given the context, it’s standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, boilerplate set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 TNB client. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The slight risk score reflects the potential for untrusted input, but in this context, it is acceptable and expected.\n\n**Final recommendations:** Keep the risk score at 0.1 to acknowledge the passing of user input, but overall, the code is safe and legitimate.",
