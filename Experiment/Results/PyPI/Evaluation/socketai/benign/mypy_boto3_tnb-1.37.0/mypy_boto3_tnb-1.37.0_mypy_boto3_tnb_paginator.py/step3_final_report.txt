  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 TNB client, facilitating static type checking and interface clarity.",
  "sources": "Class methods 'paginate' accepting **kwargs, class inheritance, and import statements for type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flow from method parameters directly to underlying boto3 paginator, with no processing or validation.",
  "anomalies": "Passing **kwargs directly to the paginator could be misused if user input is malicious, but this is standard SDK pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, primarily for type annotations and class structure. No dynamic execution, no secrets, no obfuscation. The only minor concern is the passing of untrusted input via **kwargs, which is typical in SDK wrappers and does not constitute malicious behavior. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard, and safe. It serves as boilerplate for boto3 paginator classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The slight risk associated with passing **kwargs is negligible and consistent with common SDK practices.",
