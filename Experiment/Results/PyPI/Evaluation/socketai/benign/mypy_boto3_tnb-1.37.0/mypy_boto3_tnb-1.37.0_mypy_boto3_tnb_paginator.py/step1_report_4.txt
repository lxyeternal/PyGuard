{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the 'tnb' service client in boto3, aiding static type checking and IDE features.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods receiving **kwargs for pagination.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs which are passed directly to the underlying Paginator.paginate() method, potentially untrusted input.",
  "flows": "User calls paginator instances, which invoke the 'paginate' method passing untrusted **kwargs, leading to the PageIterator returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual logic detected. The code mainly defines classes and methods for pagination.",
  "analysis": "The script defines paginator classes for various 'list' operations, utilizing type annotations for static analysis. It uses conditional imports for compatibility. All class methods delegate to the underlying 'paginate' method of the Paginator class, passing user-supplied kwargs. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks are present. The code relies on external libraries, but there are no signs of malicious behavior within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type-annotated paginator class definition for the 'tnb' boto3 service, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It primarily facilitates static type checking and correct paginator usage.",
