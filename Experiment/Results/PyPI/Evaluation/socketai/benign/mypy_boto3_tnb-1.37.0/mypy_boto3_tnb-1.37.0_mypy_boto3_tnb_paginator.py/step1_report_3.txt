  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the TNB service client in boto3, enabling typed pagination over specific AWS TNB resources.",
  "sources": "Code imports sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and custom type definitions from type_defs module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain data sinks or untrusted data handling that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious commands.",
  "flows": "The code defines paginator classes that extend botocore.paginate.Paginator and implement a paginate method, which accepts keyword arguments for pagination parameters, but no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard type-annotated wrapper classes for SDK pagination.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured, type-annotated classes for AWS SDK paginators, importing necessary modules and defining classes with a paginate method. It includes conditional import for typing.Unpack, and uses conditional base class assignment depending on TYPE_CHECKING. All parts are consistent with standard SDK extension patterns. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident; the code appears purely for type safety and interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of type annotations and class definitions for paginator wrappers in a boto3 AWS SDK extension. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It appears to be boilerplate code to support type checking and IDE support.",
