  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 TNB service client, enabling type-checked pagination of various resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods accessing paginator functionality.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain data sinks or data output operations, focusing solely on class and method definitions for pagination.",
  "flows": "Paginator class methods call the underlying Paginator.paginate method with provided kwargs, with no external untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard, well-structured type annotation and class inheritance for boto3 pagination.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines paginator classes for boto3 TNB client, using type annotations for inputs and outputs. It conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version, uses TYPE_CHECKING for type hints, and defines classes inheriting from Paginator with overridden paginate methods. There are no signs of malicious activity, hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The code's purpose aligns with documentation and type safety. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond standard class definitions. All imports and class structures appear legitimate and standard for boto3 type stubs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3 TNB client with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
