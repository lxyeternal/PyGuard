{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 TNB service client, enabling paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and custom type definitions; reading of sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; focus is on class definitions and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional import is standard; no unusual or suspicious code structures or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines paginator classes with type annotations for boto3 TNB service. It uses conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions and leverages type checking via TYPE_CHECKING. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling is present. The code strictly deals with type definitions and class method signatures for paginators, with no side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, standard, and safe. It serves to provide type-safe pagination classes for boto3 TNB clients without any malicious intent or security issues.",
