  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is for type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 TNB, with no malicious activity or security issues.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, defining classes and methods with type annotations. No external data, network calls, or dynamic execution are present.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Given the absence of any suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The report assigns a confidence of 1.0, which seems justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code as type annotations and class definitions for paginators, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, purely for type safety and interface definition. No external interactions or data handling.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Malware score remains 0. The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; the report is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is described as safe, providing type annotations and paginator classes without malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The code defines classes extending Paginator, with no dynamic or external code execution.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. The code is boilerplate for type safety.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting that the 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs, which could be untrusted input, but no malicious behavior is observed.\n- **Assessment:** The key point is that the 'paginate' method passes user-supplied kwargs directly to the underlying paginator, which could be considered a potential surface for misuse if the input is malicious. However, this is standard for paginator usage, and no actual malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated to 0.1 due to the potential for untrusted input, but no evidence of actual malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, as there's no malware behavior.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower at 0.9, which is reasonable given the cautious note.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe; the caution about untrusted kwargs is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's role in static typing and paginator class definitions.\n- **Assessment:** No external data handling or suspicious code. The code is standard boilerplate.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Malware remains 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is static, for type annotations and paginator class definitions.\n- **Malware risk:** None of the reports find evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly due to the passing of kwargs, which is standard in such SDK wrappers.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of malicious activity, should be **0** or very close to it. The only slight concern is the passing of **kwargs** in 'paginate' methods, but this is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code                                |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No external data handling, secrets, or suspicious activity |\n\n**The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for static type checking and interface definition.**",
