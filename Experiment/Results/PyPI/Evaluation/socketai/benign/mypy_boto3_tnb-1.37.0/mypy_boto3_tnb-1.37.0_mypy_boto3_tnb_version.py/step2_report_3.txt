  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`) with a copyright comment. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or external data sources involved. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for version declaration. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0 or 1):** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.  \n- **Malware Score (0):** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0):** Correctly assigned as there are no security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**  \nSince the code is purely static and does not involve any dynamic or external interactions, there's no justification for increasing the malware or security risk scores. Any higher score would be unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, static version declaration with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a benign, straightforward version declaration. No changes needed.",
