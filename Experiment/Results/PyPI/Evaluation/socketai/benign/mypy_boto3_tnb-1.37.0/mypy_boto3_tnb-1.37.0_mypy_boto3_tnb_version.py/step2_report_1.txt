  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue present?** No. The code is a straightforward assignment of a static string to `__version__`. No dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is accurate.\n- **Scores?** All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue present?** No. The code only assigns a static version string.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature.\n- **Scores?** All zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue present?** No. Same as above; static assignment.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue present?** No. Simple version declaration.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Appropriate zeros.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue present?** No. Again, a static version string.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** All zeros.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the overall assessment:\n- The code is a minimal, static version declaration with no input, output, dynamic code, or external data interaction.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the simplicity and static nature of this code, **I would assign the following scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**No changes needed.** The reports are consistent and accurate.",
