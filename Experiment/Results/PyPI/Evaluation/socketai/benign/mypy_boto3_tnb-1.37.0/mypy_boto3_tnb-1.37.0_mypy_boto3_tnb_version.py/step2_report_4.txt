  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe a simple, static assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external data sources involved.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__` with no suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Are there any errors or flawed reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** All are 0, justified by the benign, static assignment.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n- No report claims or implies any vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the obvious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard version declaration, common in Python projects.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores—no changes needed.",
