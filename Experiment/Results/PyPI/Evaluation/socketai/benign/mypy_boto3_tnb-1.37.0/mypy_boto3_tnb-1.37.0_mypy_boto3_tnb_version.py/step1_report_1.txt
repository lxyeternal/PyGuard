  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and only sets a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring comment and a variable assignment setting __version__ to a static string. No input handling, no external data, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for version definition in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
