  "flows": "Assignment of version string to __version__, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the comment claims source of truth for version and includes a copyright statement.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string for the module, which is a common practice. It contains a copyright notice with a future year, but no executable or suspicious code is present. No input handling, data processing, or external data sources are involved. The code appears to be purely informational and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply defining a version string with an associated comment. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
