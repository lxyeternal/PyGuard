  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process external data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with a static version string and a copyright comment. The year 2025 is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring comment and a static assignment of a version string to __version__. It does not involve dynamic code, input/output, external data, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and static nature. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is a standard version declaration with no vulnerabilities or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-risk elements. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary; the scores and assessment are correct.",
