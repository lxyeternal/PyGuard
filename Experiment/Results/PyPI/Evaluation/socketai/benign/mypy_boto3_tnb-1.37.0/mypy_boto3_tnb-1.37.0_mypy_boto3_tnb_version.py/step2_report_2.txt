  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is straightforward, with only a docstring comment and a variable assignment.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The version string is hardcoded, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - The mention of a future year (2025) in the copyright is unusual but not suspicious; it could be a typo or an oversight, but it does not impact security.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Overall Security Assessment**:\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My own assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- Confirm that this code remains static and unaltered.\n- No security concerns are associated with this snippet.",
