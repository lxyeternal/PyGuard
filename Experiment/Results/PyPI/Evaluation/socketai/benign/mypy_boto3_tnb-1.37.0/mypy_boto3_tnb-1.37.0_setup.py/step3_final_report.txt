  "purpose": "Setup configuration for mypy-boto3-tnb package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; static data used, no untrusted input or code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignment with no dynamic flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, defines static package metadata, dependencies, URLs, and classifiers. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, code execution, or untrusted data flows. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or secrets. All signals indicate a benign, well-formed package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature.",
