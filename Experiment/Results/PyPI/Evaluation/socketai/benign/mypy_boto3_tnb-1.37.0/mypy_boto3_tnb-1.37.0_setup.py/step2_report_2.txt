  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script, reading a local README.md file, defining package metadata, and calling `setuptools.setup()`.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code is standard for Python packaging, with static strings and well-known patterns.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports correctly identify the script as benign.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores:** All are set to 0 or very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws, errors, or mistakes are identified in the reports. The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n### Score justifications:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified; code is straightforward and readable.\n- The **security risk score** of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- The only minor point is that the `long_description` is read from a file, which is standard practice, but if the README.md were malicious or compromised, it could pose a risk. However, since it's a static file, and no processing of untrusted input occurs, this is not a concern here.\n- The dependency `typing-extensions` is version-dependent, which is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and no security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
