{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-tnb Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; uses setup() parameters to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data is processed or executed in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; the code primarily reads a local file and passes static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The script is standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script importing Path and setuptools, reading a README file for long description, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The dependencies and URLs are static and do not indicate malicious intent. The script contains no obfuscated code or unusual logic, and all parameters are straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
