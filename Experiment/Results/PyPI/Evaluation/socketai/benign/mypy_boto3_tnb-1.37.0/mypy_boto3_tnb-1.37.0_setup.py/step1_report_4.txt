{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-tnb package, providing package metadata and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; static string literals for package info and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data used for package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no user input or network data processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports Path for file handling and setuptools.setup for package configuration. It reads a static README.md file for long description. The setup() call contains package metadata, dependencies, and URLs, all hardcoded and static. There are no dynamic executions, user inputs, environment variable manipulations, or network interactions. The code follows typical Python package setup patterns without suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The presence of only static configuration data suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
