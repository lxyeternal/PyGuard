  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-tnb package to configure installation parameters and metadata.",
  "sources": "File reading for README.md; data from setup() parameters (e.g., strings, package data).",
  "sinks": "Potentially the read_text() method reading README.md; no other untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Path from reading README.md file to LONG_DESCRIPTION; no other significant data flows or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The script is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for reading a local file, then uses setuptools.setup() with static metadata for package configuration. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. The install_requires line specifies a version-dependent dependency, which is standard. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
