{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-tnb', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for the long description, and package metadata such as name, version, author info, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sources or executes untrusted input; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or system compromise are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading local files and defining package metadata to calling the 'setup()' function, which performs standard package installation procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. All dependencies and URLs appear legitimate and typical for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, with safe reading of a local Markdown file for description. All fields are typical for Python package configuration. No external or untrusted data sources are processed at runtime, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It follows standard practices for Python package configuration.",
