{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the boto3 TNB (Telco Network Builder) service.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions including method parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Methods that invoke AWS API calls, generate presigned URLs, or handle resource identifiers and tags.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (kwargs) to API calls or URL generations; no explicit data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; code appears to be standard SDK interface with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS TNB with method signatures corresponding to API operations, leveraging type annotations for safety and clarity. It imports necessary modules, includes overloads for paginators, and models exceptions. No data is processed or manipulated beyond SDK calls. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows are present. The code mainly serves as a typed interface for API communication, which is typical for SDK stubs.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard, type-annotated interface for AWS SDK operations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this module. It appears safe and legitimate, intended for use as a client wrapper around AWS TNB service API calls.",
