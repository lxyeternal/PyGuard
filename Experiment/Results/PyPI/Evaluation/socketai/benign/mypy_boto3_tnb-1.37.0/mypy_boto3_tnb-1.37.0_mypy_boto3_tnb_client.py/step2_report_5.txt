  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and class definitions for AWS TNB client. No dynamic or runtime code.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The code is a straightforward interface with type annotations.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, functioning as a standard SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The high malware score (0.9) seems unjustified given the purely static, type-annotated interface with no runtime or network activity. It is a safe, standard SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type annotations and interface structure.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, data processing, or suspicious patterns. The code is a static interface.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score of 1 is excessive. The code is purely declarative, no runtime or network activity. Malware score remains 0, obfuscated remains 0, and overall risk should be minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on the code's structure, imports, and method signatures.\n- **Analysis:** No data processing, no network calls within the code, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Again, the code is a static interface. The high risk score is unjustified; should be near zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, emphasizing the code's role as an SDK wrapper.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Same conclusion; the high risk score is unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the code as a standard SDK client wrapper, with conditional imports and method signatures.\n- **Analysis:** Mentions that methods could send data over the network, but this is inherent to SDKs. No malicious intent or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical SDK code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, which might be considering the potential for data leaks via URL generation or tagging, but given the static nature of the code, this is a minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a static, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS TNB. No runtime logic, no data processing, no network activity within this code snippet.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports concur that there is no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are mostly high (0.9–1), which is unreasonable given the static, read-only nature of the code. The only slightly elevated score (0.2) in report 5 is more justifiable but still low.\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code, payload, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — The code is a standard SDK interface with no active data flows, secrets, or malicious logic.\n\nThis code is a type stub or interface layer, intended for static type checking and IDE support, not executable logic. It is safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0              |\n\n**Note:** Any high risk scores assigned in the reports are overestimations based on the static, non-executable nature of this code.",
