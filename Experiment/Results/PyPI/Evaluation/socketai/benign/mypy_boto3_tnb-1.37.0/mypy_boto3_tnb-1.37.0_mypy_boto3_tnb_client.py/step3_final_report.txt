{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 AWS TNB client, serving as a static SDK stub for type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports of modules, class definitions, method signatures, and documentation strings; no runtime data or logic.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Method signatures and property definitions without executable flows or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or data exfiltration logic. The absence of runtime logic, obfuscation, or secrets indicates a benign, auto-generated or boilerplate module intended for static type checking. The only potential concern is the inherent risk in SDK features like presigned URLs and resource tagging, which could be misused if the SDK is used improperly, but this is not a reflection of malicious intent within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK interface with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk arises from the potential misuse of SDK features, not from the code itself. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential misuse, not malicious code.",
