  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK interface with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk arises from the potential misuse of SDK features, not from the code itself. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential misuse, not malicious code."
