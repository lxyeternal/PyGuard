{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client wrapper for the AWS TNB service, facilitating SDK usage with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; type annotations for method parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Methods that accept or return data, such as API parameters, responses, and exceptions, primarily used for SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow from input (kwargs unpacked from type defs) to API calls; responses flow back as return types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic detected. The code mainly consists of method signatures and type annotations. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS TNB with methods corresponding to API operations, utilizing type annotations for inputs and outputs. The methods are standard SDK wrappers, with no implementation details showing suspicious behavior. The exception class is a straightforward extension of botocore exceptions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are found. The code's structure aligns with typical SDK wrapper code, emphasizing type safety and documentation links. No anomalous or malicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK client wrapper for AWS TNB. It contains no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It mainly facilitates API interaction with type annotations, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
