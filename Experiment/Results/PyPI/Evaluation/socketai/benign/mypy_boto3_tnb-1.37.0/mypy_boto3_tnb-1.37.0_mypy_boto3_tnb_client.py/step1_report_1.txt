  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 TNB service, facilitating typed interaction with AWS TNB resources.",
  "sources": "Module imports, class property/method definitions, and inline documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters unpacked from type definitions (input types), return statements, and property/method annotations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (untrusted data) are unpacked into method calls; outputs include typed responses and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present. Documentation links and class structure appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class property/method definitions, and documentation strings. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration code is present. Methods are thin wrappers that unpack input types and return typed responses. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The import structure adapts to Python versions but remains standard. The class and method signatures conform to typical boto3 client pattern, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, type-annotated boto3 client wrapper for AWS TNB service, with no indication of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as an interface layer for API interactions, and all code appears legitimate and secure.",
