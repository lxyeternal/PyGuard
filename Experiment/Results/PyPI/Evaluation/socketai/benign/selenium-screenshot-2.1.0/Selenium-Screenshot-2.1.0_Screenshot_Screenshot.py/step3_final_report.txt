  "purpose": "A utility class for capturing full-page or element-specific screenshots using Selenium WebDriver, with options to hide elements and stitch images for full-page captures.",
  "sources": "Web page DOM properties (scrollHeight, offsetWidth, clientWidth, scrollHeight), WebDriver execute_script, WebElement location and size, filesystem for saving images.",
  "sinks": "Saving images to disk, executing JavaScript to manipulate DOM, deleting temporary files, setting window size, scrolling.",
  "flows": "Read page dimensions and element positions -> hide specified elements -> scroll and capture screenshots in parts -> stitch images -> crop element images -> save final image.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity; standard use of Selenium and PIL libraries; error handling via print statements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard webpage and element screenshot operations, including stitching for full-page images and cropping for specific elements. It manipulates the DOM to hide elements, scrolls through the page, and manages temporary files securely. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical screenshot utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign screenshot utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
