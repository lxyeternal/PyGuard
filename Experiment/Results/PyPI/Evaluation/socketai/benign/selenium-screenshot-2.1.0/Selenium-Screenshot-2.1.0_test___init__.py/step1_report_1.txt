  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, subprocess calls, or data outputs. Due to lack of explicit code, no specific sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from sources to sinks are not clearly evident without more detailed code. No flows can be confidently identified from the given snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present in the provided code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal or missing, with no evident functions, data handling, or control structures. Without additional context or code content, it is not possible to identify malicious behavior, unusual patterns, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign but incomplete for a definitive assessment.",
