  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Screenshot module, which captures full-page and element-specific screenshots of web pages using Selenium WebDriver.",
  "sources": "Reading the test HTML page at the server, accessing web elements via Selenium, and obtaining screenshot images via Screenshot methods.",
  "sinks": "Saving images to disk, opening images from disk, and deleting images after comparison.",
  "flows": "WebDriver loads web page -> Screenshot methods generate images -> images are opened for comparison -> images are deleted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code. Use of external libraries appears standard for testing and image processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs automated web testing with Selenium, capturing screenshots for comparison. It uses standard libraries (PIL, selenium, webdriver_manager) and does not contain hidden or malicious behavior. The image files are generated, read, compared, and then cleaned up locally. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's operations are limited to local file handling and web automation, with no suspicious network or system actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward test suite for visual regression testing of web pages. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
