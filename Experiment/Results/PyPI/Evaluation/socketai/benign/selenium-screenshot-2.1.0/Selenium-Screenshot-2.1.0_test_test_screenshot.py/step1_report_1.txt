{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of unittests for a screenshot automation tool using Selenium WebDriver, designed to capture full-page and element-specific screenshots of a webpage served locally.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables and system paths, accesses local files for reference images, interacts with a local web server, and loads webpages via WebDriver.",
  "sinks": "Opens image files (Image.open), removes temporary screenshot files (os.remove). No network connections or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "WebDriver loads URLs → Screenshots are captured → Images are compared and temporary files deleted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of external libraries (selenium, PIL, webdriver_manager) is standard for such testing purposes. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed. Commented-out assertions suggest incomplete test code but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, implementing unittests for webpage screenshots using standard libraries. It initializes a local server, navigates to test pages, takes screenshots, compares images, and cleans up temporary files. No network connections to external domains, no code injections, and no data leaks or malicious system modifications are present. The overall structure and functions align with typical testing practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign testing suite for webpage screenshot functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates within the expected scope of a test framework, with no signs of sabotage or covert data exfiltration.",
