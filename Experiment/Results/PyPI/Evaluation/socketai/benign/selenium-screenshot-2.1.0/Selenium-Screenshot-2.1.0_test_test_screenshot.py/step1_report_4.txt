{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform automated visual testing of web pages by capturing full-page and element-specific screenshots using Selenium WebDriver, and comparing them to reference images.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from web page loading via URLs and local file paths for reference images. No external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Image processing functions (Image.open, ImageChops.difference), file system operations (os.remove), and WebDriver interactions (driver.get, find_element).",
  "flows": "WebDriver loads URL -> Screenshots are taken -> Images are compared -> Files are deleted. Data flows from web driver to local storage and image processing libraries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of `webdriver_manager.chrome` to manage ChromeDriver is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard testing libraries and image comparison tools for visual regression testing. It loads web pages and takes screenshots, compares images for differences, and cleans up files afterward. No network or sensitive data handling, no credential use, or malicious activity is present. The code appears to be a legitimate testing script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard automated visual testing setup that compares screenshots to reference images to detect UI changes. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
