      "conclusion": "The analyzed reports generally provide accurate assessments of the code's security posture. The suspicion in some reports is based on inferred behaviors rather than concrete evidence. The scores are mostly justified, with minor overestimations in moderate suspicion cases. The overall security risk is low, and the code does not exhibit malicious intent or obfuscation. Continued monitoring and further code review are recommended if more detailed code becomes available."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing suite for visual regression of web pages. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to local file and server interactions, which are typical for such testing scripts."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. Security risks are minimal, and obfuscation is not present. Slightly lowering the risk score for Reports 2 and 5 could improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable given the cautious language. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on the provided summaries."
