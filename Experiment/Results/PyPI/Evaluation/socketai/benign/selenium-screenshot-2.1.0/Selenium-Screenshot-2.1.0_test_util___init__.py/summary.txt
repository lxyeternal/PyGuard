  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. Security risks are minimal, and obfuscation is not present. Slightly lowering the risk score for Reports 2 and 5 could improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable given the cautious language. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on the provided summaries."
