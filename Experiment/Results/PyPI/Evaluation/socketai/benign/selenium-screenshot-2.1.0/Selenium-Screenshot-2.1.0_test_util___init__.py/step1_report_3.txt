  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility function, but without specific context, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables via 'os.environ'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to logs, executing system commands, or transmitting data over the network (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'input_data' and environment variables through various processing functions and potentially to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious API calls are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions. No dynamic code execution or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard imports and functions. It processes input data and environment variables without any signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are visible. The logic appears straightforward and benign. Absence of network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms suggests no malicious intent. Without additional context or hidden code, the code looks clean and safe.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code seems to serve a benign utility purpose. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the clarity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
