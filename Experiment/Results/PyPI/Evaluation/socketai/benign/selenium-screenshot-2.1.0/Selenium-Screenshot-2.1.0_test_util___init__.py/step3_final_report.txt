  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, environment files, and potential data sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or malicious actions through network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or inputs to sinks such as network or file operations, with no suspicious intermediate steps identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; reports note potential risks only hypothetically.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.3), with Report 5's slightly higher score (0.45) potentially overstating risk given the lack of concrete suspicious features. Confidence levels are high for clear benign code, moderate where details are limited. Recommendations suggest slight adjustments to risk scores in Reports 2 and 5 if further code analysis confirms absence of dynamic eval/exec or hardcoded secrets. Overall, the assessments are consistent, cautious, and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. Security risks are minimal, and obfuscation is not present. Slightly lowering the risk score for Reports 2 and 5 could improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable given the cautious language. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on the provided summaries.",
