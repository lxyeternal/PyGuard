{
  "purpose": "This code sets up and runs a simple HTTP server serving files from a specified directory, intended for local or controlled environment use.",
  "sources": "abspath() function call to resolve directory path; input parameters to run_server() such as 'directory' and 'port'.",
  "sinks": "HTTPServer serving files; serving over localhost; no external network data sinks or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (directory, port) → path resolution (abspath) → server initialization and binding → server running in background thread.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'partial' for handler; no apparent anomalies. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a local HTTP server with a customizable directory and port. It uses standard library functions and threading to run the server asynchronously. No external data is fetched or sent beyond serving local files. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, and no suspicious network activity are present. The server is bound to localhost, limiting external exposure. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation for local file serving with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for a local HTTP server with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.",
