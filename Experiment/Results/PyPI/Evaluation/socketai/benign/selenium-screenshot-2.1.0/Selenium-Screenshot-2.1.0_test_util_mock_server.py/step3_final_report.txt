{
  "purpose": "Launches a local HTTP server serving static files from a specified directory, primarily for testing or local file access.",
  "sources": "Reads the directory path (via abspath), initializes the HTTP server, and handles incoming requests through SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.",
  "sinks": "Serves files over localhost; no external data sinks or network transmissions beyond serving static files.",
  "flows": "Input directory path -> server setup with handler -> incoming HTTP requests -> serving files from directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and threading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a local file server. It binds to localhost, uses safe directory resolution, and runs in a daemon thread, minimizing external attack surface. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The server's scope is limited, and no external network activity occurs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Potential misuse (serving sensitive files) is a deployment concern, not a code flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard local file server with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and justified. Overall, it poses minimal supply chain security risk.",
