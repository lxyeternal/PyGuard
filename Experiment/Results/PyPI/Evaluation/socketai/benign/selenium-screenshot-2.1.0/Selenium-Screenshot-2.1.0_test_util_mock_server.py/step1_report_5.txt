  "purpose": "To run a simple HTTP server serving files from a specified directory on localhost.",
  "sources": "abspath(directory), HTTPServer initialization with address and port, user-supplied 'directory' parameter.",
  "sinks": "HTTPServer and SimpleHTTPRequestHandler handling network requests, serving files.",
  "flows": "Input directory -> abspath() -> partial() -> HTTPServer setup -> server_bind() -> serve_forever() -> network responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of threading is standard for server handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a local HTTP server with customizable directory and port. It binds to localhost and runs asynchronously in a daemon thread, allowing other processes to continue. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The server is configured to serve files from the specified directory, which could pose security concerns if misused, but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data flows, and no anomalous behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple, local file server without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond potential misuse of the file serving capability. It appears safe based on the provided code.",
