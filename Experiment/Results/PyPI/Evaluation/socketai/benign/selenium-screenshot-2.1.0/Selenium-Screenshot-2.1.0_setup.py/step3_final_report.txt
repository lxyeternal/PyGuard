{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of the 'Selenium-Screenshot' Python project, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling",
  "flows": "Reads static README content into variable; passes static parameters to setup() without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with no obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports common modules, reads a README file, and calls setup() with static parameters. There are no dynamic inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the script. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The code performs typical packaging tasks and does not process untrusted data or execute code dynamically.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its static, straightforward nature. No further action or warnings are necessary.",
