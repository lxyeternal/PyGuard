{
  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package named 'Selenium-Screenshot', including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; configuration data provided directly in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data being processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code strictly reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and 'setuptools' modules, defines the package directory, reads the README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no input validation, dynamic code execution, or network operations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It merely defines the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
