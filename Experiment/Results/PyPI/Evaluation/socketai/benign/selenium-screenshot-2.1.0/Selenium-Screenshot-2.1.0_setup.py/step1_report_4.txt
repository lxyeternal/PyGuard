  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'Selenium-Screenshot'.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> uses data in setup() call for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. Uses standard packaging procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging, importing necessary modules, defining package metadata, and calling setup() with standard parameters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. No external or untrusted input sources other than reading a README file, which is benign. No potential for malicious data leakage, backdoors, or sabotage identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
