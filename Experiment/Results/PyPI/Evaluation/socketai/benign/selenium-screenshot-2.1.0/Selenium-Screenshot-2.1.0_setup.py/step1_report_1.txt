{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project called 'Selenium-Screenshot'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package metadata from hardcoded strings; imports os and setuptools modules.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable functions or operations.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content into a variable, then passes static configuration data to setuptools.setup() without any dynamic or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports. The code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a README file, and invokes setuptools.setup() with static, well-defined parameters. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no network activity, or backdoors present. The script strictly performs package configuration and distribution tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no obfuscated or malicious code, and it does not perform any suspicious operations.",
