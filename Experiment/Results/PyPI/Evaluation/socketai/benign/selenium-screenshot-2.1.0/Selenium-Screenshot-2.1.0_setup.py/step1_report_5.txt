  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'Selenium-Screenshot' intended for packaging and distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reads the README file to incorporate its content into the package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; standard setup script with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static configuration for package distribution. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion rules. There are no inputs from untrusted sources during execution, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious code patterns. Usage of 'setuptools' for packaging is standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure packaging parameters.",
