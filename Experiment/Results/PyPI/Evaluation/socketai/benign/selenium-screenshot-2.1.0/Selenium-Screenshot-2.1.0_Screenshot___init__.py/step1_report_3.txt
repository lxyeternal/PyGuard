  "purpose": "Defines the public API for the module, exposing the 'Screenshot' component.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code only declares an export list with no actual implementation, suspiciously minimal.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment only sets the '__all__' variable to include 'Screenshot'. There are no functions, classes, or other executable code. It does not perform any data processing, input reading, or output. The simplicity and lack of additional context make it unlikely to contain malicious behavior. However, the minimalism itself warrants caution as it may be a fragment or a stub.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal module export declaration with no apparent malicious behavior. Its purpose appears to be defining public API exposure. Due to the lack of functional code, it is unlikely to be malicious, but the context is limited.",
