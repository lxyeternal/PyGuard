  "anomalies": "Code only contains an assignment of a list with a single string 'Screenshot'; no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a list with one string element to the special variable __all__, which controls the public interface of a Python module. There are no input, output, or execution behaviors present. The code is minimal and standard for module exports. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module export declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
