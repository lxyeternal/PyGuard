{
  "purpose": "Provides activity context management, heartbeat, cancellation, and logging utilities within a workflow system, primarily using contextvars to track activity state.",
  "sources": "Reads from context variables, heartbeat details, logs, and user-provided activity info.",
  "sinks": "Logs, heartbeat functions, telemetry data, and context propagation; no external network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Internal data flow into logs, heartbeat calls, and context variables; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard activity context handling, logging, heartbeat, and cancellation mechanisms typical for a workflow SDK. It uses contextvars for context management, provides decorators for activity functions, and includes telemetry and logging utilities. No malicious patterns, external network calls, or data leaks are present. The security risk stems mainly from logging untrusted data, which is inherent in telemetry systems but not malicious. The code is well-structured, clear, and follows best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured activity management utility for a workflow SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified given its purpose and behavior.",
