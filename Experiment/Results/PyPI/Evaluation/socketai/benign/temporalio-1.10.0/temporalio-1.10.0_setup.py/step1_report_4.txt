{
  "purpose": "This code is the setup script for the 'temporalio' Python SDK package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and build instructions for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies, package data files, and build commands; it does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process or output untrusted data; the script does not perform any data leaks, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script solely configures build parameters and dependencies for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code strictly adheres to standard package setup procedures, importing modules, defining dependencies, and executing build steps.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, package data, and invokes build functions. All operations are standard for Python package distribution. No code injection, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. It does not perform any runtime data handling, external communication, or system modification outside of package building. The code is structured and formatted according to typical standards, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup script for building and distributing a Python SDK package. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this code. It functions solely to configure package metadata and invoke build procedures for the 'temporalio' package.",
