{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'temporalio' Python SDK package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and build instructions.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools.setup', package data, dependency lists, and build functions from external modules; reads package metadata and dependencies from variables; executes build process.",
  "sinks": "Executes build process via 'build(setup_kwargs)' and 'setup(**setup_kwargs)'. No data flow to untrusted sinks or external systems outside standard build processes.",
  "flows": "Source: package metadata variables and import statements; flow: package data and dependencies into setup functions; sink: build and install commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The code strictly manages package setup and build, with no apparent malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup activities: importing modules, defining package data, specifying dependencies, and invoking build functions. All operations are typical for Python package setup. No suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, or system modifications are present. The build functions are imported from an external module ('build') and used to generate the setup configuration and execute the build process, which is normal for a Python package build script. The entire code is static, well-structured, and adheres to common setup script practices. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security threats. It performs typical package configuration and build steps. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
