{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup parameters for the 'temporalio' Python SDK package, including package data, dependencies, and build instructions. It is used to package and distribute the SDK via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for packaging, including package lists, package data, dependencies, and build instructions. It also imports setup tools and build modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands based on untrusted input. The code only performs package configuration and build setup, with no runtime data processing or network interactions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining package metadata and dependencies to invoking a build process that creates distribution artifacts. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the build process executes locally with static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code strictly manages build setup and packaging. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leakage is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for packaging and distribution of a Python SDK. It imports standard setup tools, defines package data and dependencies, and invokes a build process. There are no runtime inputs, no external data processing, and no code that interacts with the system outside package configuration. All operations are static and controlled, indicating standard package setup behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and build instructions. Therefore, it is safe with no identified security concerns.",
