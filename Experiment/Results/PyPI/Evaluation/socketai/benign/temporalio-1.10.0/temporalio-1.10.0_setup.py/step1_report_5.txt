{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'temporalio' Python SDK package, including dependencies, package data, and build instructions.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, package data files, and build instructions. It does not process external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any operations that could lead to data leaks, network communications, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks that could introduce vulnerabilities. The build process is standard and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly manages package setup and build procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration, utilizing 'setuptools' and custom build functions. It specifies dependencies, package data, and metadata for publishing the SDK. The code includes detailed inline documentation, but no code execution or dynamic behavior is present. It does not fetch data from external sources, execute arbitrary code, or handle untrusted input. The build process calls an external 'build' function to assemble the package, which is typical for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs package configuration and build steps as intended, with no evidence of sabotage, data leakage, or malicious behaviors.",
