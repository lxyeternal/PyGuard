{
  "purpose": "The code provides additional setup options for building a Python package with Poetry, specifically configuring Rust extensions and cleaning up egg-info directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'setup_kwargs' dictionary, imports 'shutil' for file operations, and reads the 'Cargo.toml' file for Rust extension configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code updates 'setup_kwargs' with Rust extension configuration and then removes the 'temporalio.egg-info' directory, with no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code performs standard package build setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and a known build utility ('setuptools_rust') to configure Rust extensions in the package. It updates the setup parameters with specific Rust extension details, including binding type and features, and ensures the build directory 'temporalio.egg-info' is cleaned up to prevent duplicate files. No external data inputs, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are present. The operations are typical for a package build script and do not involve any suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build configuration script for a Python package that includes Rust extensions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
