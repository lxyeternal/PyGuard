  "purpose": "Configure build options for a Python package with Rust extensions and perform cleanup of build artifacts.",
  "sources": "Reads 'Cargo.toml' for Rust extension configuration; accesses filesystem to remove 'temporalio.egg-info'.",
  "sinks": "Removes 'temporalio.egg-info' directory via shutil.rmtree.",
  "flows": "Updates setup_kwargs with Rust extension parameters, then deletes build info directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; directory removal is standard cleanup in build processes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build setup script configuring Rust extensions using setuptools_rust, updating build parameters, and cleaning up build artifacts. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The removal of 'egg-info' is a common step to prevent duplicate files and is justified in this context. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard build configuration routine with no malicious intent or security risks. The removal of build info is routine cleanup, not malicious activity.",
