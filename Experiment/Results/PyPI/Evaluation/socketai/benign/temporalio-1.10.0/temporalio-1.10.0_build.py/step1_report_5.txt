{
  "purpose": "The code configures build setup options for a Python package using setuptools and Rust extensions, specifically for building a Rust extension module via PyO3.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses static configuration data within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code performs filesystem cleanup and updates build parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The removal of 'temporalio.egg-info' directory could potentially be used to hide build artifacts or manipulate package metadata, but this is standard cleanup in build scripts. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily updates build parameters for a Python package, specifying Rust extensions via setuptools_rust. It clears the egg-info directory as cleanup. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activities, or code injection points. The removal of egg-info may be suspicious in other contexts, but in build scripts it is typical cleanup. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script for building a Python package with Rust extensions. It does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. The removal of the egg-info directory is typical build cleanup. Overall, the code appears benign.",
