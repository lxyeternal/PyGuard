  "purpose": "Configure additional build options for a Python package using setuptools and Rust extensions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it modifies setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or output. The code interacts with filesystem (removes directory) and build configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted source to sink; mainly static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of RustExtension for building Rust code within Python package; no anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code updates build configuration parameters for a Python package, specifically adding Rust extension building via setuptools_rust. It removes a directory ('temporalio.egg-info') to prevent duplicate files in the wheel. No input handling, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard for hybrid Python-Rust packages and does not contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup utility for building a Python package with Rust extensions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs configuration and filesystem cleanup as expected.",
