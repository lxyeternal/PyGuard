  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports standard modules (`shutil`) and `setuptools_rust` for Rust extension configuration.\n- Defines a `build()` function that updates `setup_kwargs` with:\n  - A Rust extension configured with specific features.\n  - Sets `zip_safe=False`.\n  - Empties `packages` and `package_data`.\n- Removes the `temporalio.egg-info` directory via `shutil.rmtree`.\n- No input data, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard build setup with Rust extension.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that no malicious behavior or anomalies are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar configuration, notes removal of `egg-info` as potentially unusual but explained.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the directory removal as potentially suspicious but concludes it's standard cleanup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) due to the directory removal, but this is a common practice in build scripts. No malicious intent.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup, straightforward.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious actions, standard build configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Standard build utility, no external input.\n- **Analysis:** No data leaks or malicious behavior, just filesystem cleanup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, notes potential for misuse of directory removal but deems it typical cleanup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports due to the removal of `egg-info`. While unusual in some contexts, in build scripts it is common and not inherently risky or malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The removal of the `temporalio.egg-info` directory is a standard cleanup step in build processes to prevent duplicate files. It is not malicious but could be misused in other contexts, which is why a small security risk score is justified.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack, malicious code, or obfuscation is present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, related to filesystem cleanup but standard practice)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are aligned with this assessment. The code is a typical build configuration script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The small security risk score due to directory removal is justified but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
