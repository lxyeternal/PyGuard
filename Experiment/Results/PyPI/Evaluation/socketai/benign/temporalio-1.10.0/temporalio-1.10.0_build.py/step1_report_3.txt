  "purpose": "To configure build options for a Python package that includes Rust extensions, specifically for Poetry build system.",
  "sources": "import shutil, from setuptools_rust import RustExtension, Binding, from function parameter setup_kwargs",
  "sinks": "shutil.rmtree, update method on setup_kwargs",
  "flows": "import shutil -> shutil.rmtree -> build function -> setup_kwargs.update -> RustExtension definition",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of Rust extensions via setuptools_rust is standard for Rust-Python bindings.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a build configuration function for a Python package, adding a Rust extension with specific features, and removes potential residual info directories. No suspicious or malicious actions are evident. The code handles package setup safely, focusing on build configuration, with no hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard build configuration script for a Python package with Rust extension support. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
