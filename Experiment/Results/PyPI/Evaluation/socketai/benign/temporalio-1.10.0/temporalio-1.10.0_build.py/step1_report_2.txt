{
  "purpose": "Configure build options for a Python package using setuptools_rust, specifically for Rust extensions with PyO3 bindings.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'temporalio/bridge/Cargo.toml' file when setting up the Rust extension.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'shutil.rmtree' to delete the 'temporalio.egg-info' directory, which could be used to hide artifacts if misused.",
  "flows": "The source reading 'Cargo.toml' feeds into the RustExtension configuration; the build setup updates package metadata and removes egg-info directory.",
  "anomalies": "The removal of 'temporalio.egg-info' directory could be unusual, but it's documented as preventing duplicate files. No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script. It imports standard libraries and third-party modules (setuptools_rust). It updates setup parameters to include a Rust extension built with PyO3, setting specific features. It also deletes the egg-info directory to avoid duplicate files. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only potentially unusual action is directory removal, but it is explained and appears intentional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for building a Python package with Rust extensions. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The removal of the egg-info directory is intentional to prevent build artifacts duplication, not malicious activity.",
