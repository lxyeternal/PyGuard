{
  "purpose": "Provides common utility classes, data structures, and abstractions for the Temporal SDK, including retry policies, search attributes, metrics, and related helpers.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and external libraries, class and function definitions, data structure initializations, static methods, property accessors, and internal utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling identified. No code injections, data leaks, or insecure operations observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily within class methods, property accessors, and static utility functions. No external data flow or network activity is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or anomalous constructs observed. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and intended for SDK utility functions.",
  "analysis": "Reviewed the entire codebase including imports, class definitions, methods, and internal functions. The code implements data classes, enums, abstract classes, and utility functions for SDK components like retry policies, search attributes, and metrics. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or code execution patterns detected. Functions are standard and for SDK configuration, data management, and validation. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies on external protobuf and Temporal API modules but does not execute or process untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely infrastructural and utility-focused, designed for use within the SDK context. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of SDK support classes with no supply chain security concerns.",
