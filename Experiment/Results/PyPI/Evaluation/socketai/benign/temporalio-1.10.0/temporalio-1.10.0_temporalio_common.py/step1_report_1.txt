{
  "purpose": "This code provides common utility classes, functions, and constants used in the Temporal SDK for handling retries, search attributes, metrics, and other core functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, Google protobuf internal modules, and Temporal SDK API modules.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified that handle untrusted data; no data sinks such as network transmission or system command execution are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow paths are present; the code mainly defines data structures, enums, and utility functions without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code predominantly consists of data class definitions, constants, and helper functions. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, with clear definitions of retry policies, search attribute handling, and metrics interfaces. It utilizes standard Python features like dataclasses, abstract base classes, and type annotations. The presence of helper functions for protobuf handling and type hint extraction are typical for SDK utilities. No operations involve system modifications, network calls, or data processing that could be malicious. The use of warnings and validation methods are standard for robust SDK design.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be standard SDK utility code focused on defining data structures, constants, and helper functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. The code does not process untrusted input in a risky manner and contains no suspicious logic or backdoors.",
