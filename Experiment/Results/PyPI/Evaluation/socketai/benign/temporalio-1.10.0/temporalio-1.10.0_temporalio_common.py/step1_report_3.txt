{
  "purpose": "This code provides common utilities, data structures, and interfaces used in the Temporal SDK, including retry policies, search attributes, metrics, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, protobuf objects, and external types. Reads data from protobuf fields, function annotations, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines data structures, enums, and utility functions without executing untrusted input or performing data leaks.",
  "flows": "Configuration and method calls flow through object methods such as 'apply_to_proto', 'from_proto', and attribute accessors. No external untrusted data is propagated to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or covert behaviors detected. The code uses standard library features and adheres to typical SDK design patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes, enums, and abstract interfaces for metrics, search attributes, retry policies, and utility functions. It includes serialization logic for protobuf objects and type hint extraction, all of which are typical and safe. No evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or sabotage present. No obfuscated or unusual language features that could suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be legitimate SDK infrastructure code, focusing on data modeling, configuration, and utility functions. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks identified.",
