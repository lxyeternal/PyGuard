  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's security posture, and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility classes, enums, and functions for retries, search attributes, and metrics. No data sinks, no untrusted data processing, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely infrastructural, with no network, system modifications, or code execution. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on configuration, data structures, and interfaces. No untrusted data handling or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** No active data processing or external communication. Uses standard patterns. No obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines data classes, protobuf serialization, utility functions, and type hints. No external data leaks, network calls, or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is SDK infrastructure, with no active processing of untrusted input or code execution. Uses safe functions like `get_type_hints`, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with focus on utility classes, enums, and safe validation. Slightly lower confidence, but no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** No active data flow to external systems, no obfuscation, no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — Slightly conservative but acceptable given the nature of SDK code.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, given the code's nature. No high-risk operations are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is utility-focused, with no suspicious behavior or external data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard SDK infrastructure, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there are no malicious behaviors or obfuscation. The code is static, utility, and SDK infrastructure.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation or code hiding.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (utility classes, protobuf handling, type hints, no external calls), the risk is minimal. The slightly conservative 0.2 in Report 4 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (No malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (Clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0 to 0.2** (Very low, SDK infrastructure code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is standard SDK infrastructure with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements. The current scores reflect a very low security concern, which is appropriate.",
