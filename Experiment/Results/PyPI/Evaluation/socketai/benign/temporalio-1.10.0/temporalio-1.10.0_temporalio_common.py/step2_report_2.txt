  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, logical flaws, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility classes, functions, and constants for the Temporal SDK. No untrusted data sinks, no data flow from source to sink, no anomalies, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Findings:** Purely data structures, enums, helper functions; no network, system modifications, or code execution.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. The code is standard SDK infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions, data structures, and policies. No untrusted data handling or malicious behaviors.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external communication.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data classes, protobuf interactions, and type hints. No active data processing or external data leaks.\n- **Findings:** No code injection, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar SDK utility code, with detailed analysis indicating no untrusted data handling or malicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, standard SDK patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly elevated, perhaps due to cautious approach, but still very low.\n\n**Note:** The security risk score of 0.2 is slightly higher than zero but still indicates minimal concern. Given the content, this seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is infrastructural, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Findings:** No network, no code injection, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.2, which is acceptable given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and analysis.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are justified.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0 — purely utility code with no external or untrusted data processing.\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard SDK infrastructure, free from malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and the detailed analysis confirms the safety of this code segment.",
