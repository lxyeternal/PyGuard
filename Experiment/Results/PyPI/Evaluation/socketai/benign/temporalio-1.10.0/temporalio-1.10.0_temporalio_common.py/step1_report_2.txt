{
  "purpose": "Provides common utilities, data structures, policies, and metrics interfaces used in the Temporal SDK for workflow orchestration.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party packages, and protobuf-generated modules; class and function definitions that handle configuration, metrics, and search attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or network communications are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "N/A - primarily data structure and interface definitions without active data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or obfuscated imports present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes, enumerations, abstract base classes, and utility functions for metrics, search attributes, policies, and protobuf interactions. It employs standard design patterns and type hints without any signs of malicious intent. No input/output operations, network calls, or system modifications are included. The presence of 'from_proto' and 'apply_to_proto' methods for protobuf objects is standard for SDK components. The 'inspect' and 'get_type_hints' functions are used safely for type introspection without executing untrusted code. All code appears to serve configuration, data handling, and interface purposes typical for an SDK. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of SDK utilities with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly defines data structures, policies, and interfaces without active processing or external communication. The code appears safe and appropriate for its intended use in the Temporal SDK.",
