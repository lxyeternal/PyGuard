{
  "purpose": "Utility classes, data structures, protobuf interactions, and configuration functions used in the Temporal SDK.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from protobuf objects, type hints, and internal constants; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output, network activity, or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code primarily defines data classes, enums, and helper functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, no unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard SDK infrastructure, including data classes, enums, protobuf serialization/deserialization, and utility functions. It does not process untrusted data in a risky manner, nor does it perform network or system modifications. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 to 0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured, non-malicious SDK utility module with no evidence of sabotage or supply chain attack. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects its infrastructural nature.",
