  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard data serialization framework with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The potential security concerns relate to processing untrusted payloads, which is a common risk in such libraries but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and low risk (~0.2) are appropriate and justified."
