  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SDK client for Temporal services, with no malicious intent, sabotage, or backdoors. The only potential security concern is the optional protobuf message logging, which could leak sensitive info if misused, but this is a standard debugging feature and not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2)."
