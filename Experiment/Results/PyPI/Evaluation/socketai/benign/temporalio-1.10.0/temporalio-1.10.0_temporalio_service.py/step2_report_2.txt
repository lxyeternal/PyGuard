  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a client framework for Temporal gRPC services, with configuration inputs (TLS, retry, proxy, metadata, API key, target host). No static secrets are embedded; certs/keys are passed at runtime.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network calls via bridge client; no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. Logging is conditional, controlled by a flag.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard client library. No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is thorough, and the conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—client setup, configuration classes, connection methods, RPC invocation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Metadata and API keys are mutable; network calls are made over the bridge client.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network domains. Standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on configuration, environment variables, untrusted metadata, and RPC calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data sent over network; metadata can be supplied externally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets; logging could leak sensitive info if enabled. No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard client library, no malicious activity. Potential concern about logging in production but not malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; typical SDK considerations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—configuration, connection, RPC handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Requests and metadata sent over network; no embedded secrets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity; standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, security-conscious SDK, minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Very high confidence, no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a client SDK for Temporal, with configuration and RPC mechanisms.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network calls with untrusted data, but no embedded secrets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, secure client code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No. All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured SDK client.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the code's transparency.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, mostly around logging and untrusted metadata, which are typical SDK concerns, not indicators of malware.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** All reports correctly identify that no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slight risk due to potential misuse of logging or untrusted metadata, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical SDK client for a well-known service, with no embedded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscation. The only minor concern is the optional logging of protobuf messages, which could leak sensitive info if enabled in production, but this is a common debugging feature, not malware.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (very low)  \n\nThe overall assessment aligns with the reports: this is a legitimate, standard client SDK with no malicious intent.",
