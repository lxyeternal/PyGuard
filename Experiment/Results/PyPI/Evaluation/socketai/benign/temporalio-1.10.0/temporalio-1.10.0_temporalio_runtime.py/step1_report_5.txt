{
  "purpose": "This code defines runtime and telemetry configuration classes for the Temporal Python SDK, including metrics, logging, and telemetry setup.",
  "sources": "Input data includes method parameters, class property values, and configuration objects. No direct user input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially be logged or used in metrics; logging records are created and sent to loggers, but no untrusted data is directly executed or written to files or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs and class properties into internal configuration objects and logging methods; no external untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code adheres to standard configuration and metrics patterns; no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, configuration setup, and methods for managing telemetry, metrics, and logging for the SDK. It creates configuration objects, manages runtime singleton, and forwards logs. No external data inputs, command execution, or network activity is present. All operations are within the scope of configuration and data handling, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of the SDK's runtime setup and telemetry management. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It is well-structured and focused on configuration, metrics, and logging. No security risks or malware are detected.",
