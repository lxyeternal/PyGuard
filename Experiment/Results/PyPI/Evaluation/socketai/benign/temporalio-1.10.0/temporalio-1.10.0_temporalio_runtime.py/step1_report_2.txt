{
  "purpose": "Provides runtime, telemetry, and metrics configuration and management for Temporal Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports various modules and classes; class and method definitions; constants and configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no network or file I/O operations; no suspicious data leaks.",
  "flows": "No external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mostly configuration and internal method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data; code appears to be straightforward SDK infrastructure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines runtime management, telemetry configurations, logging setup, and metrics handling for the SDK. It includes standard logging, configuration objects, and protocol interfaces for metrics. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. No data exfiltration or network activity is evident. The use of protocol classes for metrics ensures modularity without executing external code. The code appears to be part of an SDK or library infrastructure rather than malicious code. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK infrastructure for runtime, telemetry, and metrics management. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured, with no hardcoded secrets or dangerous operations. The overall security risk is very low.",
