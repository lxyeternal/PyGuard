{
  "purpose": "Provides runtime environment, telemetry, logging, and metrics configuration for the Temporal Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Configuration data, logger messages, telemetry and metrics objects, internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "Internal configuration objects, logs sent to user-defined loggers, metrics sent to core telemetry infrastructure.",
  "flows": "Configuration objects flow within the module; logs are handled locally; metrics are managed via internal core runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SDK infrastructure component managing runtime, telemetry, logging, and metrics. It uses standard patterns, data classes, and protocols. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. Logging and metrics are handled locally, with no external data leaks or untrusted input processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK runtime configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
