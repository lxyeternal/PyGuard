{
  "purpose": "The code provides a module-level description and versioning information for the Temporal Python SDK, serving as an entry point or metadata file.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads version information from a local module (.service).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present in this code.",
  "flows": "Imports version data from a local module, with no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code consists solely of docstrings, import, and variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code includes descriptive documentation, which is standard for SDK modules. It imports a version string from a relative module and assigns it to the __version__ variable. There are no user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious patterns are identified. The code's structure is typical for SDK initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward SDK metadata and documentation module with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code detected. It serves informational and version-tracking purposes only.",
