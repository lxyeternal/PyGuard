  "purpose": "To provide an SDK for Temporal, a workflow orchestration system, with documentation links and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __version__ from .service module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input, no network connections, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily imports and defines version info.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Only version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the version from a local module, assigns it to __version__, and provides docstrings with links. No external data is read, no untrusted inputs, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard module initialization code that imports version info and provides documentation. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security issues are detected.",
