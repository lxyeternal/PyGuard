  "purpose": "This code provides a basic SDK module for Temporal, primarily importing version information from a service module and setting the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .service import __version__ as __sdk_version",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "The imported __version__ flows from the service module into the current module to define __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and consists solely of a docstring with documentation links and an import statement that assigns a version number from a local service module. No user input, network calls, or sensitive data handling occurs. No anomalies or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK module initialization with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely imports version info for the SDK and provides documentation links.",
