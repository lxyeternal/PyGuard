  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Overview:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python module that:\n     - Contains documentation links.\n     - Imports `__version__` from a local `.service` module, renaming it as `__sdk_version__`.\n     - Assigns `__sdk_version__` to the module-level `__version__`.\n   - There are no user inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data handling.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward SDK initialization or metadata file.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Concerns:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - The import is from a local module, likely part of the SDK package.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The purpose is purely informational/documentational, providing version info and links.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The reports consistently mention the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency and Scores:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they are consistent and justified.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code only imports a version string from a local module, the only potential concern would be if the `.service` module were malicious or compromised.\n   - However, this is outside the scope of the provided code snippet; the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is standard SDK boilerplate for version management and documentation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Aspect             | Assessment                                               |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score      | 0 (no malicious activity detected)                        |\n| Obfuscated Score  | 0 (no obfuscation present)                                |\n| Risk Score         | 0 (no security risk identified)                           |\n| Justification      | The code is a simple, standard module for version info, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. It does not handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The import is from a local module, likely trusted within the SDK package. |\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe current scores and conclusions are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.",
