  "purpose": "Provides SDK version information and documentation links for the Temporal Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ from a local .service module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ from .service to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and assignment, no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal SDK metadata module that imports a version string from a local module and assigns it to __version__. It contains only documentation and simple import/assignment statements, with no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code's purpose is purely informational. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of the .service module, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and do not require changes.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
