{
  "purpose": "The code provides a brief module-level documentation and imports the version information from a service module for the Temporal SDK in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads a version string from the .service module.",
  "sinks": "The version string is assigned to a module attribute; no untrusted data handling or output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The version data flows from the .service module into the __version__ attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The import appears standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily documentation and a simple import statement that retrieves the SDK version from another module. No user input, network calls, or sensitive data handling occurs. The structure and formatting are standard. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign module that provides version info for the Temporal SDK. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
