{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and error handling for Temporal workflows and activities, including various failure types, timeouts, and retries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for asyncio, datetime, enum, typing, and Temporal API modules. No user input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data manipulation, network access, or system modification detected.",
  "flows": "The code defines exception classes and a function to check exception causes; there are no data flows involving external input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behavior observed. The exception classes and the function are standard and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes custom exception types for handling errors in Temporal workflows, with properties and methods that facilitate error reporting and handling. It imports only standard and Temporal SDK modules. The 'is_cancelled_exception' function checks exception causes against known cancellation types. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to serve as a structured error handling module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of error classes and a utility function for Temporal workflow error management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions solely as a structured exception framework, with no hidden malicious code.",
