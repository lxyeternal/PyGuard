  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for Temporal workflow/activity errors, no external or untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, benign, and well-structured. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on structured error classes, no external data, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Also straightforward, serving as an error handling framework. No malicious intent or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, with detailed exception classes and a utility function for cancellation detection.  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no external data flows, no obfuscation. The `is_cancelled_exception` function correctly checks exception causes.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 — possibly slightly conservative; no actual risk detected.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar exception classes, no external data or system modification, standard pattern.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, purely error classification.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as previous, structured error handling, no external interactions, no malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Clear, benign, and secure implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, the code is purely class definitions and a utility function.  \n- **Malware or Malicious Behavior:** None detected. The code does not perform any network, file, or system operations, nor does it execute untrusted code.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward and well-structured.  \n- **Security Risks:** Minimal; the code is a benign error handling module. The slight security risk score in one report (0.1) is conservative, but since no external data or malicious activity is present, it can be lowered to 0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should be **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0** for all reports, given the clarity and straightforwardness.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0** for all reports, as the code is purely structural with no security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes and utility functions for Temporal workflows. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores should all be zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
