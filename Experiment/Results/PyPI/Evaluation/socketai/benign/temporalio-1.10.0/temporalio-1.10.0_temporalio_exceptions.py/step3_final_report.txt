{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and utility functions for handling Temporal workflow errors, timeouts, cancellations, and related failure states.",
  "sources": "Internal class properties and exception initializers; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and property access; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definitions and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of well-structured exception classes for Temporal workflows, including failure, timeout, activity, child workflow, server errors, and cancellation. It includes properties for detailed error info, enums for timeout and retry states, and a utility function 'is_cancelled_exception' to identify cancellation-related exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling. The code serves purely as an error classification framework with no network, file, or system modification activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for structured error handling within the Temporal SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
