  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for Temporal errors.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data, no untrusted input processing.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Standard class definitions, properties, and a utility function for cancellation detection.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. \n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining error classes and error handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data or network operations.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, standard exception hierarchy, utility function correctly checks exception causes.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, supply chain risk minimal.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines exceptions and a cancellation check.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external or untrusted data, no network activity.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Well-structured, standard pattern, no signs of malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Benign, purely for structured error handling.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly above zero, but justified by cautious assessment).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for Temporal workflows.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data processing or network calls.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical class hierarchy, no suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or security risk.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Error classes and enums for Temporal.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external or untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Clear, standard, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm that the code is purely defining exception classes and a utility function for cancellation detection. No external data, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks are present.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risks:** The overall security risk is minimal; the slight non-zero risk score in one report (0.1) seems to reflect a cautious stance but is not justified by any actual vulnerability.\n\n### Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (No malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (No security risks identified)\n\n### Final Justification:\nAll reports agree on the benign nature of this code. It is a standard, well-structured exception handling module for Temporal SDKs, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across reports.",
