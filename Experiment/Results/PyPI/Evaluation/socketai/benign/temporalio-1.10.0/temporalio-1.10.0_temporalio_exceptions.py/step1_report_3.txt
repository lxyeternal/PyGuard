{
  "purpose": "Define various exception classes for handling errors in Temporal workflows and activities, including failure types, timeouts, and cancellations.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (asyncio, datetime, enum, typing, temporalio API modules). No external data sources or input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes and properties that may log or handle error information; no untrusted data flows explicitly. No direct data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Errors are instantiated with messages and optional details; the function is_cancelled_exception inspects exception types and causes to determine cancellation status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed. The code strictly defines exception types and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling Temporal workflow errors, including failure, timeout, activity, child workflow, and server errors. These classes include properties for detailed error information, enabling structured error reporting and handling. The is_cancelled_exception function checks whether an exception signifies a cancellation event, considering various exception types and causes. All code relies on standard library features and known API modules, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No external data or untrusted sources are read; the code serves as a structured error handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception definitions for error handling in Temporal workflows. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present. It appears to be purely for error representation and checking logic.",
