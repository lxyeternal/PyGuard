{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Temporal workflow errors, timeouts, and failure states.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and Temporal API modules; class constructors and property methods; the function is_cancelled_exception.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data sinks that process untrusted input directly or perform security-sensitive actions such as network communication, file manipulation, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "The code primarily creates exception instances and checks exception types; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to potentially malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes that extend from a common base, providing structured error handling for Temporal workflows, including specific errors for timeouts, failures, cancellations, and retries. All classes utilize standard Python class design with properties and initializers. The function is_cancelled_exception checks exception types and causes for cancellation signals, which is a standard pattern. No external data input, network operations, or suspicious code constructs are present. There are no signs of malicious code or data leakage mechanisms. The imports are standard, and the logic is clear and typical for exception handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for Temporal workflows with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It performs no actions that could harm or leak data; it simply structures error handling logic.",
