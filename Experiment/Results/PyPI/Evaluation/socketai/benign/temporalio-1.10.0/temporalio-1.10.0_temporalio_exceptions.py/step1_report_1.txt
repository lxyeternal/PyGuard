{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and error handling classes for Temporal workflow and activity failures.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from constructor parameters, class properties, and imported modules. No external or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code primarily defines exception classes and a utility function.",
  "flows": "The utility function checks exception causes; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard exception handling and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard class definitions for handling various Temporal workflow and activity errors, including properties and constructor logic. The is_cancelled_exception function accurately checks exception types related to cancellation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The imports are from known modules, and the code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. Overall, it appears to be a well-structured, benign exception handling module for Temporal workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception classes and a utility function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve as part of a Temporal SDK or client library for error management without any malicious behavior.",
