  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical flaws, or signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines exception classes and a utility function (`is_cancelled_exception`) without external data handling or network operations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, serving as a structured exception framework for Temporal workflows.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes exception classes and a cancellation check function, with no external data flows or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Exception classes and the `is_cancelled_exception` function are defined with standard patterns. Slightly higher confidence (0.9) in benignity, but no malicious signs.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 (due to minimal uncertainty), Obfuscated: 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar structure; no external data, no network, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly a benign error handling module.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard exception classes, enums, and a utility function, all straightforward.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code Presence:** No malicious code, no data leaks, no obfuscation, no network or external system interaction.\n- **Logical Flaws:** None detected; the code is well-structured for error handling.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports correctly assign zero malware scores, as there's no evidence of malicious activity. Risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Potential Assumptions:** Some reports assign a very small risk (0.1) due to uncertainty, which is reasonable given the lack of context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a maximum of 0.1 is appropriate if there's any uncertainty; otherwise, 0.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code is a standard, safe exception handling module with no malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate; the code is safe, and the scores reflect that.",
