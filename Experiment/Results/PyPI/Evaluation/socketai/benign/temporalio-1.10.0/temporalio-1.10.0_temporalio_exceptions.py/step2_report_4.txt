  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exceptions for Temporal, with no external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors. The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign, well-structured, and purely for error handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code establishes exception classes for Temporal workflows, with no external data flows or malicious intent. The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code; no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and a utility function for cancellation detection. It emphasizes the absence of suspicious patterns, external data, or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the code's nature, this is acceptable as a conservative estimate. The code's purpose is error handling, not executing external or untrusted code.\n\n**Analysis:** The reasoning is thorough; no signs of malicious activity. The small security risk score is reasonable, perhaps accounting for the fact that exception handling can sometimes be misused if misconfigured, but overall minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward set of exception classes with no external data or malicious behavior. The analysis confirms no suspicious patterns or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is consistent, and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, focusing on the structured exception classes and enums, with no external data flows or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely exception class definitions and a utility function for cancellation detection.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero only in Report 3 (0.1), which is reasonable given the minimal risk associated with exception handling code.\n\n- **Risk scores > 0.5:** None, all are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the potential for exception handling to be misused if misconfigured, but overall very low.\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are consistent, accurate, and cautious. The code is a standard, benign set of exception classes for Temporal workflows with no signs of malicious or supply chain issues.",
