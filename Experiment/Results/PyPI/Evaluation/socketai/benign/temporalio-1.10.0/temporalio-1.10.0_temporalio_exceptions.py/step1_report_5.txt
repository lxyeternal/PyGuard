{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes and enums for handling errors in Temporal workflows and activities, providing structured error information and classification.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (asyncio, datetime, enum, typing) and third-party 'temporalio' protobuf modules; exception initializers and property methods that process error data.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are present; no network, file, or external data operations are performed within this code.",
  "flows": "Error classes are instantiated with messages and optional failure data; error objects are used to classify and handle workflow/activity errors but do not involve data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. It relies entirely on well-structured class definitions and property accessors. No unusual or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes tailored for Temporal workflow error handling. It includes enums for timeout and retry states, and various error classes capturing detailed context for different failure scenarios. The import statements are standard, and no network or system modification functions are present. All methods perform data encapsulation and classification without executing untrusted code or external interactions. The overall design appears to be a clean, secure error handling module with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain tampering.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides structured error handling for Temporal workflows, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It is a benign, well-structured error classification library that does not pose security risks.",
