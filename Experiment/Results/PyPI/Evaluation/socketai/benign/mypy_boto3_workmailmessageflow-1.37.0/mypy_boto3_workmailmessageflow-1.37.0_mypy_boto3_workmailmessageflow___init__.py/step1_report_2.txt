{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to the workmailmessageflow service, primarily importing and exposing the client class for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing WorkMailMessageFlowClient from a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input; code only sets up imports and exposes classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscated code. Copyright date is in the future (2025), but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module that imports a client class from a local module and exposes it via a variable and the __all__ list. The code includes documentation and a usage example. There are no data inputs, no external calls, and no potentially malicious code segments. The presence of a future copyright date is unusual but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code functions as a straightforward interface layer without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface module for the workmailmessageflow service, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security issues. It simply re-exports a client class for use elsewhere.",
