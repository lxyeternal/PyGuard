  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple module that imports a client class and exposes it, with no data processing, external input, or network activity.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of the code itself:** The code matches the descriptions; it’s straightforward and does not contain malicious elements.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores:** All reports assign 0 to malware and obfuscated scores, and very low or zero to security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only \"anomaly\" noted is the future copyright year (2025). This is not a security issue but could be a typo or placeholder.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is minimal or zero.\n- Some reports assign a securityRisk of 0.0, others 0.1; given the benign nature, 0.0 seems more appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1.0), which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is purely boilerplate with no dynamic or external data handling, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk score should remain at 0 or very close to it, given the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities or malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only questionable element is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the future date as a minor oversight, but more appropriately 0)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no security risks.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n- Scores assigned by reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
