  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a minimal Python module that imports a client class from a local module (`.client`), assigns it to a variable (`Client`), and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- Contains a module docstring with documentation links and usage example.\n- Contains a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future.\n- No dynamic code, no untrusted data, no network calls, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward and matches the description. No issues in functionality.\n- **Malicious code:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not handle untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025).  \n  - **Is this an error?** Possibly a typo or oversight, but it does not impact security.\n  - **Is it suspicious?** No, just an inconsistency.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** All assign 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- None of the reports justify raising the scores, as there's no evidence of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not security-related.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to 0, e.g., 0.1, but 0 is more accurate)\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n| -------- | ------------ | ----- |\n| **0**  | **0** | **0** |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no security concerns. The reports are consistent with this assessment.",
