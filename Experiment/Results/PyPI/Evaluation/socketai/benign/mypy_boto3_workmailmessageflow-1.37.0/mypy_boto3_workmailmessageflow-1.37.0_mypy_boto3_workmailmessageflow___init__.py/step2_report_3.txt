  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports a client class and exposes it.\n- There are no dynamic data inputs, no external data handling, and no execution of untrusted code.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is not malicious.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The logic and structure are standard for SDK interface modules.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources involving untrusted data are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it is not a security issue.\n- No other errors or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign very low or zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities justifies higher scores.\n- The code is purely boilerplate for an SDK client interface.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly notes the benign nature.\n- The future copyright date, while unusual, does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code review, I agree with the given scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0 or very close to 0\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, possibly due to the future date, but practically negligible)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
