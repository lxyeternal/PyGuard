  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set to 2025, which is future-dated, might be unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and defines exports. It includes documentation and type annotations. No external data handling, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for SDK interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface module for a boto3 service client with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, nor does it perform any harmful actions.",
