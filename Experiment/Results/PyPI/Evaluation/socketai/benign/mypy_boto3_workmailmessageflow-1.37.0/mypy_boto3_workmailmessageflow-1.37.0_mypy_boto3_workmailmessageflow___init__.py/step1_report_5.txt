  "purpose": "This code serves as a main interface for the workmailmessageflow service, providing documentation and exposing a client class for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, version information, and docstrings. It does not read external user input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or handling of untrusted data within the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks. The code primarily defines and exports classes and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only notable element is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly consists of a documentation string, import statements, and variable assignments. It exposes a client class for the workmailmessageflow service. No data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward API interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign API interface module with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security issues detected. It simply exposes a client class for use in other code.",
