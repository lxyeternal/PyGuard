{
  "purpose": "Define and provide type annotations for string literals representing AWS service names used in the boto3_workmailmessageflow library.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; definitions of string literal variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; all string literals are hardcoded constants.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from external input to untrusted output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code strictly defines string literal types for documentation and type hinting purposes. The copyright statement is dated 2025, which may be a typo or an anomaly, but does not influence code security.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias definitions for various AWS service names using Python's Literal type. It includes conditional import logic for compatibility with different Python versions. No user input handling, network communication, or executable logic exists. The presence of a copyright date in the future is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign set of type definitions intended for type hinting and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only notable aspect is the future-dated copyright, which appears to be a typo rather than a security concern.",
