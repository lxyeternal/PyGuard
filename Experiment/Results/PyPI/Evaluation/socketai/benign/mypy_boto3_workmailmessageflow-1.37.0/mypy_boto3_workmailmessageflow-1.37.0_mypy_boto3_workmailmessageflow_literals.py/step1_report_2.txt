  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service names used in boto3 stubs for type checking.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; assignment of string literals to type variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants and type aliases, with no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code contains standard type definitions with no unusual patterns, hidden code, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations for AWS service names, conditionally importing the Literal type based on Python version. It includes a large list of string literals representing AWS services. There are no runtime data inputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. It is a standard type definition module for static analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, purely declarative module for defining AWS service name literals. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security risks.",
