  "purpose": "Defines Python type literals for AWS service names used in boto3 workmailmessageflow module, for type annotations and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from sys.version_info for Python version detection; no external input or data sources; defines constants and string literals for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external outputs; only static type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes type annotations and literals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The license, copyright notice, and documentation link are benign.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines type literal constants for AWS services. No data manipulation, external connections, or code execution is present. The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and documentation. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected. The code is standard and safe for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely provides type annotations for AWS service name literals, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe module for type hinting support.",
