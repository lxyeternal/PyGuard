  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literal names, facilitating type safety and code clarity in boto3-related projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check, literal string definitions for service names",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only defines constants and conditional imports",
  "flows": "Import and conditional import flows, no data processing or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and purely declarative. The copyright date is 2025, which is in the future relative to current knowledge but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type alias definitions using Literal for various AWS service names, with a compatibility check for Python versions. It includes import statements, a version check, and declarations of string literals. The copyright notice is unusual in being future-dated (2025), but this is likely a placeholder or an error, not malicious. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The code is solely for static type annotations, which is standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type annotation module for AWS service names with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
