  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS service name literals used for type hinting and documentation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string lists defining AWS service names, imported conditionally based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions with no data flow or external input.",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime data or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static module defining string literal types for AWS services, with conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic code, external data, or network activity exists. The only unusual aspect is the future date, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's purpose is purely static type hinting, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and contains no malicious or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which is not a security concern. All assessments and scores are appropriate.",
