  "purpose": "Type annotations and type definitions for the workmailmessageflow service, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, botocore.response.StreamingBody, and conditional imports for typing.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data is processed or output within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing are present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports based on Python version are standard but could be used to obfuscate or complicate understanding; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data types using TypedDict, with version-dependent imports for typing features. It includes an import of StreamingBody from botocore.response, which is standard for handling AWS response streams. No input sources or data sinks are present, and the code is purely for type definitions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code is evident. The code's structure and content are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition module for AWS service interaction, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It serves its purpose for type hinting without introducing any vulnerabilities.",
