  "purpose": "Type annotations for the workmailmessageflow service API definitions, providing structured data types for request and response objects.",
  "sources": "Constants defining type definitions, import statements, sys.version_info checks, and type annotations for TypedDict classes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code mainly defines data structures without direct data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is declarative type definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type definitions for an API using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It imports only standard library modules and well-known third-party libraries (botocore and typing_extensions). No runtime data processing or external network activity is present. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for a boto3 service. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
