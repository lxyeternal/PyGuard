  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code provides type annotations for the AWS workmailmessageflow service, primarily defining TypedDicts for request and response data structures.\n- It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions.\n- It imports StreamingBody from botocore.response, which is standard for handling streaming responses from AWS.\n- There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or external calls—just static type definitions.\n- The copyright year is set to 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports state that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. This aligns with the code content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic or reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is purely for type definitions, with no data flow or runtime logic.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are also 0, which matches the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  No reason exists to assign higher scores; the code is benign.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since no malicious behavior is present, malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as type definitions only.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future. While this is unconventional, it does not pose a security risk or indicate malicious intent.\n- The use of conditional imports is standard for compatibility, not obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for AWS SDK interactions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The reports correctly identify this.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the current scoring reflects that accurately.",
