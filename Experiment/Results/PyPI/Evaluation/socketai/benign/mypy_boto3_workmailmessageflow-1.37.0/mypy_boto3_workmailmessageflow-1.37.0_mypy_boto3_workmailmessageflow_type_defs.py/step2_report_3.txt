  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the criteria for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely for defining type annotations using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions.\n- It imports `StreamingBody` from `botocore.response`, which is standard for handling AWS response streams.\n- No data processing, user input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The copyright year \"2025\" is future-dated but not inherently malicious; it could be a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for workmailmessageflow.  \n- Findings: No data flow, no external effects, straightforward type definitions.  \n- Malware score: 0.0 — no malicious behavior.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 — code is clear.  \n- Security risk: 0.0 — no vulnerabilities.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining data structures.  \n- Findings: No data processing or external interactions.  \n- Malware score: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Security risk: 0.0  \n**Conclusion:** Also accurate, safe.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, type definitions for AWS interaction.  \n- Findings: No runtime logic, no external data handling.  \n- Malware score: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Security risk: 0.0  \n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Type definitions, similar content.  \n- Findings: No malicious activity, no obfuscation.  \n- Malware score: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Security risk: 0.0  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: No runtime code, no external effects.  \n- Malware score: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Security risk: 0.0  \n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.0; code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is standard type annotation definitions for AWS SDK interactions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious; it could be a placeholder or typo.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The analysis aligns with the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely for static type definitions, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions that could pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose for type hinting. No further security concerns are identified.",
