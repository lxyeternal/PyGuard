  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the workmailmessageflow service in boto3, providing typed dicts for request and response schemas.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, typing, typing_extensions, and botocore.response; no input data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; only data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; code purely defines types and structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward type definitions with version-based imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, uses conditional imports for compatibility, and defines typed dicts for request and response data structures related to AWS workmailmessageflow. There are no data processing, external calls, or executable logic that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS SDK structures with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and solely intended for type hinting purposes.",
