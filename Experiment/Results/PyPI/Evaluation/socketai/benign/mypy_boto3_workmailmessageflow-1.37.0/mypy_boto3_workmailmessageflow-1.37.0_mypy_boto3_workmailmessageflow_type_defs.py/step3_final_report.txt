  "purpose": "Type annotations for the AWS workmailmessageflow service, defining data structures for requests and responses.",
  "sources": "No untrusted data sources; static type definitions only, importing StreamingBody from botocore.response for AWS response handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; purely static type definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of future year '2025' in copyright, but this is benign; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type definitions using TypedDict for AWS SDK interactions, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It imports StreamingBody, a standard AWS response class. There are no runtime behaviors, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely for type hinting and documentation. The future-dated copyright is unusual but not malicious. All indicators point to a benign, standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of type annotations for AWS SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks. The high confidence scores (0.95) reflect certainty in its benign nature.",
