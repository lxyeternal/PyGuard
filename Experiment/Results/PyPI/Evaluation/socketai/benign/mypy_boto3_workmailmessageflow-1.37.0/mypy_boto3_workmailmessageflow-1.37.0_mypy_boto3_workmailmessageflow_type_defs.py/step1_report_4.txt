  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the workmailmessageflow service.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.response, typing, and typing_extensions; class definitions; constants.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code defines static type structures without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. No malicious behaviors or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type definitions and imports necessary for static type checking. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version, which is standard. No runtime code execution, data handling, or network operations that could be exploited. No sensitive data or secrets are hardcoded. The only potentially suspicious aspect is the inclusion of copyright with a future year '2025', which may be a typo but does not impact security. Overall, the code appears to be a standard type definition module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a safe, standard set of type definitions for the workmailmessageflow service. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
