  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose:**\n   - The code defines type annotations using TypedDict for the `workmailmessageflow` service in boto3.\n   - It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions.\n   - It imports `StreamingBody` from `botocore.response`, which is standard for handling AWS response streams.\n   - No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - The code is purely for type hinting and documentation purposes.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks & Malicious Indicators:**\n   - **Data flows & sources:** No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.\n   - **Obfuscation & anomalies:** Use of version-dependent imports is standard and not suspicious.\n   - **Malicious code:** No signs of backdoors, code injection, or malicious behaviors.\n   - **Hardcoded secrets:** None detected.\n   - **Future-dated copyright:** The year 2025 is unusual but not malicious.\n   - **Import of `StreamingBody`:** Standard for AWS SDK responses; no concern here.\n   \n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, standard type definitions.\n   - No mention of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), indicating certainty about the safety.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are identified across reports.\n   - The only minor concern is the future year in the copyright, which is benign.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0 or very close; the code does not introduce security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the current information.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for AWS SDK interactions.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code is benign and serves a clear purpose for type hinting without any security concerns.",
