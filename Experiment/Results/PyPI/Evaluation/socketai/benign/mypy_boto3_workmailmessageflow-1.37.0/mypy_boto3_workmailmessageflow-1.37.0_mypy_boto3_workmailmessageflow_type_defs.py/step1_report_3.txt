{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for workmailmessageflow service, used for typing in Python code interacting with AWS services.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.response, builtins or typing_extensions, and the module's own class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code mainly defines data types. No untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports typing modules based on Python version, which is standard. No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The copyright date is set to 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No user input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The only potential concern is the future date in the copyright statement, but that is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, non-malicious type definition code for AWS service interactions. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
