  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a static assignment of the version string to `__version__` with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external dependencies.\n   - The actual code snippet is just:\n     ```python\n     \"\"\"\n     Source of truth for version.\n\n     Copyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n     \"\"\"\n\n     __version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, untrusted input, or dynamic code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n   - The `securityRisk` is also 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - No reason exists to assign higher scores since there's no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid speculative claims; they base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - Given the code's simplicity, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a standard version declaration, common in many open-source projects.\n- No dynamic behavior, external dependencies, or obfuscation are present.\n- The comments and copyright notice do not introduce any security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0            |\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.",
