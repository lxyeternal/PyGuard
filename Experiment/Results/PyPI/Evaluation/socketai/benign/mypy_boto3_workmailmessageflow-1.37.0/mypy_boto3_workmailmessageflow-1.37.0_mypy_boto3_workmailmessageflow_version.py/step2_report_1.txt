  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a simple, static assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, input handling, external calls, or obfuscation.\n   - The comments and copyright notice are standard and do not influence execution.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward and benign.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The code is typical for defining a package version.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning that this is a simple, static version declaration is sound.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward nature.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, justified by the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since there's no dynamic behavior, no external data, and no suspicious code, the risk score remains at 0.\n   - Malware score is 0 because there's no malicious activity or payload.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and unaltered.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions; all are accurate.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be misconstrued as malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThis is a standard, benign version declaration in a Python package. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest any issues beyond a simple version string assignment.",
