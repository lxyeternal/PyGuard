  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with comments and version string.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static declaration of a version string (__version__ = \"1.37.0\") with comments. No dynamic behavior, input handling, external calls, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
