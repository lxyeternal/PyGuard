  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for the AWS WorkMail Message Flow service, facilitating interaction with the AWS SDK (boto3).",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs module; class properties and methods accessing AWS services.",
  "sinks": "Methods invoking AWS API calls such as get_raw_message_content, put_raw_message_content, generate_presigned_url; no untrusted data handling visible.",
  "flows": "Method calls passing parameters (possibly untrusted from callers) to AWS SDK methods that interact with AWS infrastructure.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or unusual logic. Use of type annotations, standard SDK method wrappers, and typical class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for the AWS WorkMail Message Flow service with standard SDK wrapper methods, including exception handling and property definitions. There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The class primarily provides type annotations and method signatures for SDK interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward SDK wrapper for AWS services with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard API interactions with no suspicious behavior or backdoors.",
