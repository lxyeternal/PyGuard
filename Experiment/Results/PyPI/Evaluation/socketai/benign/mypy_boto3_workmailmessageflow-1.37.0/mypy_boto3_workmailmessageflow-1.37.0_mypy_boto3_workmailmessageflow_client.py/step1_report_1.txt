{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS WorkMail Message Flow service, enabling type-checked interaction with the AWS SDK (boto3).",
  "sources": "Code reads static type definitions, system version info, and imports external libraries; no runtime data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or output data directly, only defines class structures and method signatures.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; method signatures accept parameters but do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is primarily boilerplate type annotations and class definitions without dynamic execution or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured interface definition for the AWS WorkMail Message Flow client, including exception classes, properties, and method signatures for client operations. It relies on system version checks and imports type definitions. No runtime data processing, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic is present. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard SDK interface with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK interface definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a type-safe client interface for AWS SDK operations.",
