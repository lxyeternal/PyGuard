  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues identified are valid, consistent, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward SDK interface with no malicious behavior, static analysis shows no anomalies, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard, boilerplate SDK interface with no malicious or suspicious logic. The confidence is high (1.0), and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on safe imports, standard method signatures, and no signs of malicious activity. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.2).\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical SDK wrapper. The mention of \"input parameters flowing into methods\" is standard; no evidence of malicious data handling. The small risk score reflects potential API misuse or misconfiguration, but not malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior detected. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SDK wrapper, no signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. Slightly higher confidence (1.0), and risk score of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings. The small risk score could reflect the fact that the code interfaces with potentially untrusted data via parameters, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid, well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on no data leaks or malicious code, just interface definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code remains a standard SDK wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: standard SDK wrapper, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the rest.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. They all agree the code is boilerplate SDK interface code.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern about untrusted parameters, which is typical for SDK wrappers.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n- No changes needed; the code appears benign and well-structured.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the static, boilerplate nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, related to the handling of untrusted parameters, typical for SDK wrappers, not indicative of security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports' assessments and scores are appropriate.",
