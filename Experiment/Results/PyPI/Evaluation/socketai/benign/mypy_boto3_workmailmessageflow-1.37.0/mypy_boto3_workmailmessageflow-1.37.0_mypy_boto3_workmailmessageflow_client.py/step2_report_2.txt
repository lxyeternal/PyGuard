  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a straightforward SDK interface with no malicious intent, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. It correctly identifies that the code is mainly boilerplate type annotations and class definitions, with no runtime data processing or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a static interface, with no signs of malicious behavior. The confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report notes that input parameters could influence request generation but finds no suspicious patterns or malicious code. It emphasizes that the code is a standard boto3 client wrapper with safe imports and no signs of backdoors or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The risk score of 0.2 might be slightly high given the code's nature. However, since the code accepts parameters that influence AWS requests, and there's a non-zero security risk, a small score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware score is correctly zero. The risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, given the code's nature. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, it recognizes the code as a standard SDK wrapper with no signs of malicious activity. It notes that parameters could influence AWS interactions but finds no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** The risk score is slightly lower here, which is consistent with the absence of any suspicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is identified as a benign SDK interface with no malicious patterns. No data leaks, code injection, or backdoors are observed.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard SDK wrapper, no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code, malware, or obfuscation. **0.0** is justified across the board.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on 0.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations, mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature as a client interface that accepts parameters influencing AWS requests. These parameters could, in theory, be misused, but there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n- No modifications needed; the assessments are accurate.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0.0, 0.0, and approximately 0.1**, respectively.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious activity or code vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.1   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
