  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS WorkMail Message Flow service, facilitating SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as Params, ClientMethod, HttpMethod, and request data unpacked via **kwargs in get_raw_message_content and put_raw_message_content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input parameters influencing request generation and execution, but no direct data leaks or malicious code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK method calls, which generate AWS API requests; no runtime data processing or external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, primarily boilerplate type annotations and class definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static SDK interface with type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for AWS service interaction. No runtime data processing, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The parameters are standard for SDK calls and do not indicate malicious intent. The exception class definitions and method signatures are typical and do not pose security risks. The code's static nature and adherence to SDK patterns suggest a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK interface with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
