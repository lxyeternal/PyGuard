  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-workmailmessageflow, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports pathlib and setuptools, reads a local README.md for description, and calls setup() with static package info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The metadata and URLs are standard. All signals indicate benign, static configuration. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
