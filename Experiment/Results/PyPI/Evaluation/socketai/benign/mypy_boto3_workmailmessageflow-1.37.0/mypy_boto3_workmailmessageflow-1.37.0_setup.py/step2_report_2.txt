  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script, performing static configuration tasks.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- It is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, reading a local README file, and defining package metadata.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- None detected. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified, as no security risks are present.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are correctly low.\n\n### Data flow and source analysis:\n- No untrusted sources, no external inputs, no dynamic code execution.\n- All data is static or read from local files, which is safe.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the consistent findings and the nature of the code, I agree with the provided scores.**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**             | **0**      |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- No external data or network activity.\n- All data sources are local and static.\n- The package metadata and URLs are typical and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is warranted.",
