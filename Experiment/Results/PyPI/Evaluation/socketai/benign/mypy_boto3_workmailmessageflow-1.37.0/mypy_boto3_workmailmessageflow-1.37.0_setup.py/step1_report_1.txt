  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-workmailmessageflow package, used to configure package installation details.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ path to load README.md; static package and metadata definitions; import statements for pathlib and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected. No network, file system, or environment variable manipulation present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only performs static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and follows standard setup script conventions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed package metadata. All data is statically defined or read from local files without external input or untrusted sources. No dynamic code execution, environment variables, or network interactions are present. The code is typical for Python package setup scripts and contains no malicious behaviors or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs standard package configuration tasks safely.",
