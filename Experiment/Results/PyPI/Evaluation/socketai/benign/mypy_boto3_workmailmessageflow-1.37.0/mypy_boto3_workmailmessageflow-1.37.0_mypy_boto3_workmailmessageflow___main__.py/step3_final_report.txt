  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument '--version' in sys.argv",
  "sinks": "stdout via sys.stdout.write for output",
  "flows": "Argument check in main() -> print_version() or print_info() -> output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI script that outputs package info or version based on argument detection. It imports only standard library modules, performs simple conditional logic, and outputs static text. No dynamic data, external calls, or untrusted input processing occurs. The code lacks obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
