  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses standard Python libraries (`sys`) with straightforward functions.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or processing of untrusted input beyond a simple argument check.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns.\n   - The logic is simple: if `--version` is provided, print version; otherwise, print package info.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and only outputs static information.\n   - No suspicious patterns, external communications, or malicious intent are identified.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), and all reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n   - The analysis in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and static nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n   \n   Since the code is static, simple, and well-understood, these scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here; the code is clearly informational.\n   - The reports correctly identify that there's no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n   - The logic and flow are transparent and standard.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code and reports are consistent.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary.\n   - The provided analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No further action is needed; the code is safe and benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's characteristics.",
