  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs information)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), print_version and print_info functions",
  "flows": "Command-line input (from sys.argv) triggers print_version or print_info outputs to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and primarily outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for input/output handling, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes based on command-line arguments. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or handling of untrusted data sources. The code does not contain any suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious patterns. It solely outputs static documentation and version info, serving as a simple CLI interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
