  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script for a package providing information about boto3 WorkMailMessageFlow.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output messages",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for printing info and version",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version; otherwise, print_info is called, both writing to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code observed. The code only outputs static informational text.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines three functions: print_info, print_version, and main. The print_info and print_version functions output static, non-sensitive information related to the package and its documentation URLs. The main function checks for the '--version' argument and calls the corresponding output functions, defaulting to printing package info otherwise. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources beyond command-line arguments, and all outputs are static messages. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a benign CLI utility intended solely for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package information and version. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data flows, or backdoors. Overall, it is safe and serves an informational role.",
