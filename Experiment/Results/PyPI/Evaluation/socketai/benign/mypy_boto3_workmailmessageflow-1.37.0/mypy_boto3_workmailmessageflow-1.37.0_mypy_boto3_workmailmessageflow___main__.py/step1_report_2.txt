  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs information)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (outputs package info and version details)",
  "flows": "User input via sys.argv flows to conditional check, then outputs to sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and informational.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to handle command-line input and output. It defines functions to print package info and version, then a main function that checks for '--version' argument and prints accordingly. No data from external sources is fetched or sent, and no untrusted inputs are processed. No obfuscated or suspicious logic present. The code functions solely as a CLI informational interface.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple informational CLI tool with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only outputs static package information based on user input, with no external communication or malicious code detected.",
