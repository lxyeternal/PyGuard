{
  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs information).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; no untrusted input flows are apparent.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments. It only reads input from sys.argv and writes static strings to stdout. No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, and no malicious operations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a CLI info provider. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
