{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for spatial data processing, including extracting raster values at geometry points, performing bilinear interpolation, and handling geographic features.",
  "sources": "Reads input geometries via shapely and raster data via rasterstats.io.Raster; reads vector features via read_features; obtains raster data through raster.read().",
  "sinks": "Returns interpolated raster values and GeoJSON features or lists, potentially exposing data to downstream use or external systems.",
  "flows": "Inputs (geometries, raster data) are processed through coordinate transformations and window extractions, with values interpolated and attached to features or returned as lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior present. The code primarily processes spatial data without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spatial data extraction and interpolation safely, relying on well-known libraries like numpy, shapely, and rasterstats. It uses assertions and input validation for parameters such as array shape and interpolation method. No external network connections, file writes, or data leaks are present. Functions operate locally on data and do not perform any harmful operations or access sensitive data beyond the inputs provided. Overall, the logic is standard for geospatial processing with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard spatial data processing utility with no malicious behavior detected. It securely handles raster and vector data, performs interpolation, and outputs either feature modifications or value lists. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.",
