  "purpose": "Spatial data processing: extracting raster values at geometry points, performing coordinate transformations, and interpolations for GIS analysis.",
  "sources": "Geometry coordinates, raster data read via rasterstats.io.Raster, input parameters (affine, band, nodata).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; outputs are either property modifications in GeoJSON features or lists of values.",
  "flows": "Geometry points -> coordinate transformation -> raster window extraction -> bilinear or nearest interpolation -> output values or features.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and relies on standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spatial data operations: transforming coordinates, reading raster windows, interpolating values, and generating output features or lists. It includes input validation and handles masked arrays appropriately. No malicious patterns, network activity, or system modifications are present. The functions are well-structured, and the logic aligns with typical GIS workflows. The absence of obfuscation, suspicious code, or external communication indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spatial data utility performing common GIS tasks without malicious intent. It contains no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with its functionality. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low.",
