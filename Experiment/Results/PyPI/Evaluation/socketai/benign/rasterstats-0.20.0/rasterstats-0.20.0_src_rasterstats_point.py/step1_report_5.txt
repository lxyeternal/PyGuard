{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for spatial data processing, including extracting raster values at geometry vertices, performing bilinear interpolation, and converting geometries to coordinate sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads vector features via read_features(), reads raster data via Raster.read(), and retrieves input geometries from feature dictionaries. The code also takes external affine transformation matrices and raster data as inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include geojson features with appended property values, or raw arrays of interpolated raster values. No untrusted data is written or transmitted in this code.",
  "flows": "Input vectors and rasters are processed to extract geometries and raster pixel values. Data flows from external sources (vector/raster files) into processing functions, then into interpolators, and finally into output yields.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses assert statements for shape validation but no malicious code or obfuscation is detected. No unusual or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements spatial data processing routines with functions for coordinate transformations, bilinear interpolation, and geometry traversal. It reads features, processes geometries, retrieves raster values using safe methods, and optionally outputs geojson features with appended data. No external network access, file modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of assertions and standard libraries indicates benign intent. The functions are consistent with typical GIS processing tasks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard spatial data processing module with no malicious intent. It securely handles input data, performs interpolation, and outputs spatial features or data arrays. There are no indications of malware, malicious behaviors, or supply chain sabotage.",
