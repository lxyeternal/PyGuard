{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for raster and vector data processing, including rasterization, statistical calculations, category remapping, and geometry manipulations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input geometries (geom), raster objects (like), stats data, and category maps.",
  "sinks": "The code generates CSV strings from stats, performs rasterization, and processes geometries; no direct data leaks or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Input geometries and raster objects flow into functions like rasterize_geom and boxify_points; stats data flow through stats_to_csv and check_stats; category maps flow into remap_categories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors observed. Usage of 'import' within a function is harmless here.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for geospatial data processing. It performs data validation (e.g., get_percentile, check_stats), data transformation (e.g., rasterize_geom, boxify_points), and data output formatting (stats_to_csv). The functions seem designed for legitimate geospatial workflows. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present. All external library usage (rasterio, shapely, rasterstats) are standard in GIS workflows. No evident malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are detected. The overall code structure is clean and consistent with its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of geospatial data processing utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data validation, transformation, and formatting safely within its domain. No malware or security threats are detected based on this review.",
