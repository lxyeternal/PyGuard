{
  "purpose": "Provides geospatial utility functions including rasterization, statistics processing, category remapping, and geometry manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads input geometries, raster object properties, statistical data, and category mappings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs CSV data, boolean arrays, and geometries; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Processes input geometries and data through validation, rasterization, statistical calculations, and remapping functions without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GIS data processing tasks using well-known libraries (rasterio, shapely, rasterstats). Functions include input validation (e.g., get_percentile), rasterization, CSV serialization, category remapping, and geometry adjustments. No network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code is clear, straightforward, and uses common practices. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. Security considerations are minimal; potential risks relate to processing untrusted data, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard geospatial utility library with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is conservative; given the code's nature, a risk score of approximately 0.05 is justified, reflecting minimal residual risk due to data processing context. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
