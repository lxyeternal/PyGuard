{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for raster data processing, including rasterization, statistics calculation, category remapping, and geometry manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as 'geom', 'like', 'stats', 'category_map', and internal library functions reading from raster files or geometries.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; functions process data locally and output results such as CSV strings, boolean arrays, or modified geometries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (geometries, raster objects, category mappings) through processing functions (e.g., rasterize_geom, remap_categories) resulting in output data (boolean arrays, CSV content, remapped categories, geometries).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are observed. The code appears standard for geospatial data processing. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden malicious patterns detected. The only potential concern is the handling of input geometries which is typical for GIS workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles spatial data manipulation and statistical output formatting. Functions like 'rasterize_geom' use standard rasterio features, 'stats_to_csv' serializes data into CSV, and category remapping is straightforward. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code does not contain any suspicious or obfuscated logic, nor does it process untrusted data in a manner that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The absence of code injection points or unsafe data handling further supports this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geospatial utility library with no malicious intent or security risks. It securely processes input geometries and raster data without any suspicious patterns or behavior. Therefore, it can be considered safe based on the provided code.",
