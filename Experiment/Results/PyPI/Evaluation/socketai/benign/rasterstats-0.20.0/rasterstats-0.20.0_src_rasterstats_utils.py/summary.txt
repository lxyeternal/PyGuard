  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard geospatial utility library with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is conservative; given the code's nature, a risk score of approximately 0.05 is justified, reflecting minimal residual risk due to data processing context. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
