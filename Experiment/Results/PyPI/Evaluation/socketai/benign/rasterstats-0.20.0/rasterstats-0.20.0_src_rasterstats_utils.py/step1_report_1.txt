{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for raster and vector geospatial data processing, including rasterization, statistics calculations, and category remapping.",
  "sources": "Reads input geometries (GeoJSON-like), raster objects, statistical data structures, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include boolean arrays, CSV formatted strings, and modified geometry objects. No direct sinks involve untrusted data leading to security breaches.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input geometries and raster objects through processing functions like rasterize_geom and boxify_points, with data transformations occurring within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of standard library modules (csv, io) is normal. No unsafe operations or hidden network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles geospatial data processing tasks such as rasterization, statistics validation, and category remapping. It performs input validation for statistical parameters, converts geometries into raster-compatible formats, and generates CSV summaries. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The functions include standard validation and data handling without insecure practices. No unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a typical geospatial data processing module without malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and data transformations securely. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior, and the code structure is straightforward.",
