  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a typical geospatial utility library, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It emphasizes input validation, standard data handling, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Code review:** The functions perform validation (`get_percentile`, `check_stats`), rasterization (`rasterize_geom`), CSV output (`stats_to_csv`), and geometry manipulation (`boxify_points`). All are standard operations with no network or insecure operations.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 seem appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious code or behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard geospatial data processing, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Code review:** Same functions as above, standard libraries, no network calls, no data exfiltration.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The slight securityRisk=0.1 is perhaps conservative but acceptable given the functions handle geometries and raster data which could, in some contexts, be misused if untrusted data is involved.\n\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the functions are utility-based, with no suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. Slightly higher securityRisk=0.1 possibly due to the handling of spatial data, but still benign.\n\n- **Code review:** The functions are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion; the code is a standard geospatial utility library, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Code review:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Code review:** The functions are typical for GIS workflows, with no network or insecure operations.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, which is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, possibly due to handling spatial data, but no actual security vulnerability exists. These scores are conservative.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** Given the code's nature, I would assign a **risk score of around 0.05** — very low, reflecting standard data processing without security concerns.\n\n- **Malware score justification:** No signs of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score justification:** Slightly above zero due to potential misuse of spatial data, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.05   |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe geospatial utility library with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate, but I would slightly lower the security risk to 0.05 to reflect the absence of any real vulnerabilities.",
