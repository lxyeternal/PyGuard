  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic Confirmation**:\n   - The code `__version__ = \"0.20.0\"` is a straightforward assignment of a string to a variable, commonly used in Python packages for versioning.\n   - No input, output, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a benign version declaration.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The analysis and conclusions are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Review & Justification**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Since the code is only a version string assignment, there is no reason to assign any risk or malware scores above 0.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified here.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct; code is transparent)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and standard nature of this code snippet, I agree with the assessments provided. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a typical version declaration.\n- All reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code poses no security concern.",
