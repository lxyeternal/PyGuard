  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply:\n     ```python\n     __version__ = \"0.20.0\"\n     ```\n   - This is a standard version declaration in Python packages, with no input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected across all reports.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for versioning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions**:\n   - Since the code is only a version string assignment, there are no grounds for higher malware or risk scores.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified here.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Changes Needed?**\n   - The scores seem appropriate given the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - If this is the entire code snippet, it is benign.\n   - If this line is part of a larger codebase, the context might matter, but based solely on this, there's no security concern.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|------------------|------------|\n| 0              | 0                | 0          |\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
