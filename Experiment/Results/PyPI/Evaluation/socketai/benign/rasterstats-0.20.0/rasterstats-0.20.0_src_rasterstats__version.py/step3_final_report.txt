  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to any output or data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a string to __version__, a common practice for versioning in Python packages. It contains no input/output, data processing, dynamic code, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and require no modification.",
