  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. All reports describe the code as simply assigning a string to the `__version__` variable, which is a common and benign practice in Python packages.\n2. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs mentioned across all reports.\n3. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all conclude that the code is harmless.\n\n**Confirmations and Observations:**\n- The original code snippet is exactly: `__version__ = \"0.20.0\"`.\n- This is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or flaws in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the code.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is just a version string assignment, any higher score would be unjustified.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here; this is a standard practice.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple, harmless version declaration with no security concerns.",
