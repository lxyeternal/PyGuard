  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content:**  \n   The code is a single line: `__version__ = \"0.20.0\"`  \n   It simply assigns a version string to the `__version__` variable, which is a common practice in Python packages for version tracking.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   - No input or data reading sources are present.  \n   - No data sinks or output points.  \n   - No data flows, dynamic code, or processing logic.  \n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.  \n   - No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, hardcoded credentials, or external calls.\n\n3. **Logic and Reasoning Flaws:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that this is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.  \n   There are no errors or flawed reasoning in the summaries.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - Confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.  \n   - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward assignment.\n\n5. **Potential for Malicious Behavior:**  \n   The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.  \n   - No external data is read or written.  \n   - No dynamic execution or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities, which is correct.  \n   - The code's simplicity precludes vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Security risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements.",
