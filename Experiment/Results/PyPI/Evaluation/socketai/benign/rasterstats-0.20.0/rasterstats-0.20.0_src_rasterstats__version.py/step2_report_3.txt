  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simply assigning a string to `__version__`.\n   - The original code: `__version__ = \"0.20.0\"` matches this description.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or complex logic is present.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard practice in Python packages.\n   - No flaws or errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`.\n   - These are appropriate given the simplicity and harmless nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is just a string assignment, there are no hidden behaviors or malicious intent.\n   - No need to adjust scores upward; the assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Consistency Checks:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a standard version declaration with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a benign, typical snippet used in many Python projects.",
