  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution using setuptools",
  "sources": "The setup() function call from setuptools, specifically the 'name' argument",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply invokes setup with static arguments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code with standard package setup function",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with a static 'name' argument. There are no dynamic inputs, no secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical minimal setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not include any potentially malicious commands, network activity, or obfuscated code. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, and the setup configuration is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a basic package declaration without any suspicious elements.",
