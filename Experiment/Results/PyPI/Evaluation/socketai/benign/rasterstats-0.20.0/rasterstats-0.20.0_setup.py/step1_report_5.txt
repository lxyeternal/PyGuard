  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'rasterstats' Python package, primarily for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The import statement from setuptools; the setup() function call with the package name.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function could potentially process untrusted metadata or configuration, but in this case it only specifies the package name.",
  "flows": "Import from setuptools -> call to setup() with package name",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. The setup script is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls its 'setup' function with only the package name specified. There are no input reads from external sources, no untrusted data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The script is a typical minimal setup script used in Python packaging. It does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its simplicity and standard structure suggest it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
