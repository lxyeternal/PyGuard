  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata externally in pyproject.toml.",
  "sources": "Static import of 'setup' from 'setuptools', no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external outputs; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process or transfer data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with a static package name. It contains no dynamic inputs, no external data processing, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The comments indicate metadata is managed via 'pyproject.toml', which is standard. All signals point to benign, conventional packaging code. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, with appropriate scoring. No modifications are necessary.",
