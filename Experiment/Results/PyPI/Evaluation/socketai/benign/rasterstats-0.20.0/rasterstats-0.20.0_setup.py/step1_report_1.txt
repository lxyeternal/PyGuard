  "purpose": "To define the package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call which reads package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a static name parameter. It references project metadata in 'pyproject.toml', a standard practice. There are no dynamic inputs, no execution of external code, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code appears to serve the standard purpose of package setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
