{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'rasterstats' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name 'rasterstats' from the setup function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply imports and calls setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls setup with only the 'name' parameter. This is a minimal package setup script with no additional logic or data handling. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The comment references 'pyproject.toml' for metadata, which is typical in modern Python packaging, but the script itself is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
