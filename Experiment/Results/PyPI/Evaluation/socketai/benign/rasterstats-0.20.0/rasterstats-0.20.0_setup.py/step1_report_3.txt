  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with only a 'name' parameter. No input reading, no dynamic code, no sensitive data handling. The comment indicates project metadata is elsewhere (pyproject.toml). There are no suspicious functions or code paths.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for packaging, with no malicious behavior detected. It simply defines the package name with no harmful or suspicious actions.",
