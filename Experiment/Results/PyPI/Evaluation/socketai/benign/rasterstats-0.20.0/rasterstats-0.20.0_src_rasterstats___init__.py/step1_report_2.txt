{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports functions and variables from the rasterstats package and defines an export list (__all__). It likely serves as an interface or entry point for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from rasterstats.main, rasterstats.point, rasterstats, and rasterstats._version modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows or causes security issues; purely import statements and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only imports and exports identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of the directive '# isort: skip_file' at the top may suggest an attempt to bypass automated code formatting tools, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific functions and variables from the rasterstats library and defining __all__ for module exports. No user input handling, network operations, or code execution mechanisms are present. The use of the 'skip_file' directive is non-standard but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup for a Python package, exporting specific functions and variables. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
