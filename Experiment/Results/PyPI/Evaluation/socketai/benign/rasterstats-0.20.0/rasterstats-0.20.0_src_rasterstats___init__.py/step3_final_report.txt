  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that re-exports selected functions and variables from the rasterstats package for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and variables from the rasterstats package modules and version info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual element is the '# isort: skip_file' comment, which is a formatting directive but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export module with no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The comment '# isort: skip_file' is a non-standard but benign directive. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 or very close to zero. The code's purpose is purely organizational, exposing specific functions from the rasterstats package without any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for re-exporting functions from rasterstats, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
