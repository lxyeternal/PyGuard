{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and modules from the 'rasterstats' package, likely to be used elsewhere for geospatial raster data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily through the import statements from the 'rasterstats' package modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted; the code only imports functions and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet; it's purely import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard for module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with an isort directive to skip the file during import sorting. It imports several functions related to raster statistics from the 'rasterstats' package, as well as the package's version information. The __all__ list explicitly exports specific functions and version info, indicating an intention to control the public API of this module. No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is typical for a module that re-exports selected functionalities from a package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, non-malicious code snippet used for organizing and exporting functions from the 'rasterstats' package. It does not contain malware or security risks, nor does it perform any malicious operations. The code appears safe and intended for typical package or project use.",
