{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and modules from the 'rasterstats' library and defines an __all__ list for module exports, primarily for geographic data analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'rasterstats.main', 'rasterstats.point', 'rasterstats', and 'rasterstats._version', which are library modules, not user inputs or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and defines a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The use of '# isort: skip_file' is a directive for code formatting tools, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a module-level list defining exports. All imports are from the 'rasterstats' library, which is an open-source package for spatial analysis. There are no user inputs, network operations, or data manipulations that could lead to security issues or malicious behavior. The comment '# isort: skip_file' indicates an intentional formatting skip, which is common in code organization but does not impact security. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import and export declaration for the 'rasterstats' package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
