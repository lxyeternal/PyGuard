  "purpose": "Re-exporting functions and variables from the rasterstats package for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from rasterstats.main, rasterstats.point, rasterstats, and rasterstats._version modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and assigns __all__ for exports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. The comment to skip is just a code directive.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific functions and variables from the rasterstats package and defines an export list. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read. No dangerous or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for module re-exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module re-export with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data nor contain suspicious behavior.",
