  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured geospatial data processing library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports' assessments are accurate and justified. No further action is necessary; the code can be considered safe for use."
