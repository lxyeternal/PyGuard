  "purpose": "This code provides functions to perform zonal statistics on raster and vector geospatial data, aggregating raster values over vector geometries, with options for various statistical analyses and output formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from file paths (vectors and raster) and possibly from numpy arrays and external libraries. Key input points include the 'vectors' source, 'raster' data (including array or path), and optional parameters such as 'transform' and 'zone_func'. It also reads external modules, including numpy, affine, shapely, rasterstats, tqdm, and sys.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally; it does not contain explicit sinks like network connections, file writing, or system commands. However, potential data leaks could occur if input data (e.g., vector or raster data) is sensitive. There is no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files or objects; raster data is masked and processed based on vector geometries; statistical calculations are performed; results are stored in dictionaries; optionally, properties are embedded into GeoJSON features. The flow is linear and primarily computational, with no external system calls or data exfiltration paths.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. Usage of warnings for deprecated features indicates future-proofing but no malicious intent. The only notable concern is the optional use of 'zone_func' for custom data processing, which could be misused if provided by untrusted sources, but this is a flexible extension, not inherently malicious. The code does not perform any hidden operations or obfuscation. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles geospatial data processing for statistical analysis. It reads input data, applies rasterization, masking, and computes various statistics on masked arrays. It supports optional features such as progress bars, custom zone functions, category remapping, and GeoJSON output. It does not execute external commands, write files, or transmit data over networks. The use of warnings for deprecated features shows awareness of future changes. The code's structure appears clean and consistent with standard geospatial analysis workflows. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected. The only potential concern is that 'zone_func' can accept arbitrary functions, which if supplied by an attacker, could execute malicious code within a controlled environment, but this is a standard plugin-like pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard geospatial analysis tool for calculating raster statistics over vector zones. It has no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or harmful code. Its potential security issues are minimal and relate mainly to the use of user-supplied functions ('zone_func'), which could be exploited if untrusted code is run in an insecure environment. Overall, the code is safe, with no malicious intent detected.",
