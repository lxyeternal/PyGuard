{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to perform zonal statistics on raster and vector geospatial data, primarily for spatial analysis and GIS workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from file paths or Python objects; reads raster data via Raster class; reads vector features via read_features; accesses environment variables indirectly through warnings and import statements.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are primarily data structures (dicts, lists, GeoJSON features); no direct data leaks or network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files or objects) into raster and vector processing functions; processed data is aggregated and returned as dicts or features; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of warnings to deprecate functions and parameters; reliance on dynamic imports and variable argument passing; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected; code mainly standard GIS processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles geospatial data processing using established libraries (numpy, affine, shapely). It reads raster and vector data, performs rasterization, masking, and statistical calculations. Warnings are used for deprecated parameters, but no malicious obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present. No external network operations, file manipulations beyond data reads, or execution of untrusted code are observed. Functions are straightforward, with input validation and data processing following typical GIS workflows. No anomalies such as backdoors, code injection, or privacy violations are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured geospatial data processing script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate GIS processing module performing spatial analysis tasks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The use of warnings indicates maintenance or deprecation handling, not malicious obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal.",
