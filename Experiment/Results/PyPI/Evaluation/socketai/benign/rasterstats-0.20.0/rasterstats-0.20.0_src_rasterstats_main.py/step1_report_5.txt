{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to calculate zonal statistics on raster data for vector geometries, supporting various customization and output formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'vectors', 'raster', 'stats', 'zone_func', environment variables, and file paths used in 'read_features', 'Raster', and 'np' operations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could originate from user-provided file paths, feature properties, or custom functions, but the code itself does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files, arrays, functions) through spatial processing and calculations, potentially passing through user-defined 'zone_func' or 'add_stats' functions, and then output as either property modifications or stat dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets are present. Use of warnings for deprecated parameters is typical. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spatial data processing for raster and vector data, including reading features, rasterizing geometries, masking, and computing various statistics. It offers customization points via user-provided functions and parameters, but these are for legitimate data processing purposes. No network communication, file tampering, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of third-party libraries is typical for spatial analysis, and no suspicious code patterns such as code injection, remote commands, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate spatial analysis tool designed for computing raster statistics over vector zones. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does include deprecation warnings and flexible user hooks but no malicious intent or malware are evident.",
