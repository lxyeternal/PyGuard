{
  "purpose": "Performs zonal statistics on raster and vector geospatial data, calculating various statistics for each zone defined by vector geometries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from file paths or in-memory objects, including raster arrays and vector features via read_features.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration; processes data internally and returns statistical results or GeoJSON features.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through raster reading, geometry rasterization, masking, and statistical computations, with optional user-defined functions applied before output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecation warnings for old parameters; allows user-supplied callback functions ('zone_func', 'add_stats') which could execute arbitrary code if untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard geospatial processing utility with clear structure and no malicious payloads. The main security concern is executing user-provided functions, which is a common extensibility pattern but could be exploited if untrusted code is supplied. No obfuscation or malware patterns are present. The code handles data safely, with appropriate masking and data type considerations. The use of warnings indicates awareness of deprecated features but does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code's behavior is benign, and risks are limited to potential misuse of callback functions, which is a known and manageable pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geospatial analysis tool with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the execution of user-supplied callback functions, which could be malicious if untrusted code is provided. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting this potential but not inherent maliciousness.",
