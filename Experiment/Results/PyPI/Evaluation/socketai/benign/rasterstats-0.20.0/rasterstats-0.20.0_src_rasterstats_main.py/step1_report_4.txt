{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating zonal statistics of raster data over vector geometries, primarily for spatial data analysis in GIS applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from file paths or in-memory objects (e.g., raster files, vector features). It also reads environment variables indirectly via system functions and uses external libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain typical security sinks such as network operations, system command execution, or file writing outside of expected GIS file I/O. It does use warnings and dynamic function calls, but these are standard for a GIS processing library.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files or in-memory objects. Data flows through rasterization, masking, statistical calculations, and optional property or GeoJSON output. No data is transmitted over networks or stored maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains deprecation warnings for outdated parameters but no suspicious or malicious code such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or obscure obfuscation are present. Usage of dynamic features (like inspect.signature) is standard and safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code's main functions perform spatial analysis: reading raster and vector data, applying masks, computing statistics, and optionally outputting GeoJSON features. It includes standard deprecation warnings, but no malicious logic or backdoors. The presence of warnings about deprecated parameters suggests maintenance activity rather than malicious intent. No network operations, data exfiltration, or system disruptions are detected. The code appears to be a well-structured GIS utility with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a spatial data analysis utility designed for GIS purposes. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It is safe for use in its intended context. The only minor concern is reliance on external libraries and deprecation warnings, which are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
