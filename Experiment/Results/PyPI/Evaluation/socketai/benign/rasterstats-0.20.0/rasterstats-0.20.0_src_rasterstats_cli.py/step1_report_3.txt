{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line interfaces for geospatial raster analysis, specifically generating zonal statistics and point queries on raster datasets using GeoJSON features.",
  "sources": "Input features from command-line arguments, input raster file specified via --raster option.",
  "sinks": "Outputs GeoJSON feature collections, possibly streamed to stdout. No sinks for untrusted data handling or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input features are processed through gen_zonal_stats and gen_point_query functions, then output as JSON via click.echo.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No unsafe code practices such as unsafe SQL, code injection, or environment variable misuse are evident. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a CLI wrapper around geospatial processing functions from the rasterstats library. It processes input GeoJSON features and raster datasets, generating statistical summaries and raster value queries. Input data comes from command-line parameters; output is JSON to stdout. No external network connections or data leaks are apparent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected. The code relies on trusted third-party libraries, and the logic appears to be standard and benign, focused on geospatial data processing. The only potential concern might be if the gen_zonal_stats or gen_point_query functions internally contain malicious code, but that is outside this module's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard CLI wrapper for geospatial analysis tasks with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data insecurely nor perform any suspicious operations. The code appears safe and intended solely for geospatial data processing.",
