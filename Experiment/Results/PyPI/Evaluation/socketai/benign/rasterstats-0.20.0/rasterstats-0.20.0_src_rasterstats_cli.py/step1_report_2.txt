{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line interfaces for geospatial raster analysis, specifically generating zonal statistics and point queries based on GeoJSON features.",
  "sources": "Reads input GeoJSON features via command-line arguments and options, reads raster files specified by user input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON-encoded GeoJSON FeatureCollections to standard output, potentially to files if redirected.",
  "flows": "Input features are passed to functions (gen_zonal_stats, gen_point_query) which process raster data and generate GeoJSON features; output is then printed or streamed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code, no obfuscated code, no hidden backdoors or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly uses standard libraries and third-party modules for geospatial data processing and command-line interface management. Data inputs are user-provided files and parameters, outputs are GeoJSON features printed to stdout. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code handles JSON serialization securely and does not perform any unsafe operations or system modifications. It also does not contain any suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hidden network calls, or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for geospatial raster analysis functions with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It processes user input and outputs results without any suspicious behavior or malicious actions.",
