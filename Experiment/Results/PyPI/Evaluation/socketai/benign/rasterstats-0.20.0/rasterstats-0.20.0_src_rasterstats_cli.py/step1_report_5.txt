  "purpose": "The code provides command-line tools for geospatial analysis, specifically for generating zonal statistics and point queries on raster datasets using GeoJSON features.",
  "sources": "Input GeoJSON features via command-line arguments, configuration options such as raster file paths, and optional parameters like stats, interpolate, and property names.",
  "sinks": "Outputs GeoJSON features or feature collections via standard output, possibly after JSON serialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line inputs through the functions gen_zonal_stats and gen_point_query, with results serialized to JSON and printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'click.echo' with b\"\\x1e\" (record separator) bytes before outputting features in sequence mode; no other suspicious code structures or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard libraries and well-known geospatial processing functions. Input data is read via command-line parameters and processed through external functions. The sequence mode adds a record separator byte to delimit features, which is not inherently malicious but somewhat unusual. There are no indications of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code does not perform any system-level modifications, data exfiltration, or external network connections beyond standard output. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate command-line utility for geospatial analysis without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geospatial CLI tool with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The use of record separator bytes in sequence output is somewhat unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present. The overall security risk is low.",
