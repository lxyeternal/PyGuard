  "purpose": "This code provides command-line interfaces for geospatial analysis functions, specifically for calculating zonal statistics and point raster queries using raster and vector data inputs.",
  "sources": "Reads input features from command-line arguments, GeoJSON data, and raster file paths from command-line options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs GeoJSON FeatureCollection or individual features via command-line echo, and possibly binary control characters for sequence output.",
  "flows": "Input features are read from command-line arguments, then passed to gen_zonal_stats or gen_point_query, which process the data and produce results that are output via click.echo as JSON strings or raw bytes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of raw binary control character (b\"\\x1e\") during sequence output; no hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected; no network activity or data exfiltration present; no suspicious file handling or environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The script defines two CLI commands, 'zonalstats' and 'pointquery', which process geospatial data using external library functions. The data flows from command-line inputs into function calls, then outputs processed data. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as network communication, data theft, backdoors, or system tampering. The only notable aspect is the use of a control character (b\"\\x1e\") to delimit output in sequence mode, which appears to be a standard practice for separating streamed JSON objects. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present; external libraries are used for core functionality, which is typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper around geospatial processing functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It safely processes input data and outputs results without performing any harmful actions. The only minor anomaly is the use of control characters for output delimitation, which is not malicious but worth noting. Overall, the script is safe for use in a supply chain context.",
