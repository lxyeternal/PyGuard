{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for geospatial raster analysis functions (zonal statistics and point queries) that processes GeoJSON features and outputs results as GeoJSON, with optional streaming delimiters.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for input features, raster files, and options; internal functions gen_zonal_stats and gen_point_query.",
  "sinks": "Output via click.echo, printing JSON features or feature collections; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input features -> gen_zonal_stats/gen_point_query -> JSON serialization -> click.echo (with optional delimiter b\"\\x1e\")",
  "anomalies": "Use of control character b\"\\x1e\" as a sequence delimiter in streaming output; otherwise straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface wrapping trusted geospatial processing functions, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity. The only notable pattern is the use of a record separator byte, which is a common practice for streaming JSON features. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI wrapper for geospatial analysis functions. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The use of the sequence delimiter byte is standard and not malicious. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the current scoring is appropriate.",
