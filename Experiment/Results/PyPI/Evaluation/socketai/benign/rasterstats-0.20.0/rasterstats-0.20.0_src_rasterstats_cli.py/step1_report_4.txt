{
  "purpose": "The code defines command-line interface functions for geospatial raster data analysis, including generating zonal statistics and point queries on GeoJSON features.",
  "sources": "Input features from command-line arguments or files, raster file paths from command-line options, and optional parameters such as stats or interpolation types.",
  "sinks": "Output GeoJSON features as JSON strings printed to stdout; potentially large or untrusted data streams.",
  "flows": "User provides GeoJSON features and raster paths as inputs (sources); functions process data and produce JSON outputs (sinks), with data flowing through functions like gen_zonal_stats and gen_point_query.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs or obfuscation. Use of external libraries like rasterstats is standard; no malicious code or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily orchestrates data flow between command-line input, processing functions, and output. It uses standard libraries for JSON handling and command-line parsing. No suspicious code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is observed. The use of click and cligj for CLI is typical. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. Inputs are taken from command-line options and arguments, outputs are JSON printed to stdout, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for geospatial raster analysis functions, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It processes user inputs and outputs JSON features securely. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
