  "purpose": "This code serves as a utility module for managing deprecation warnings and suppression within the Zope framework, facilitating deprecation notices and related controls.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'zope.deprecation.deprecation' module, which load functions and variables related to deprecation handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only imports functions; no data flow or execution beyond imports occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, standard module that imports specific functions and variables for deprecation management. It contains licensing comments and documentation, with no dynamic code execution, external network activity, or data handling. The imported functions are from a known package and are used for warning and suppression purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility module for deprecation handling within the Zope framework. It poses no security threat or malicious intent, and the current scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
