  "purpose": "Module for handling deprecation of other modules or APIs within the Zope framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from zope.deprecation.deprecation, which are likely standard library functions for deprecation warnings.",
  "targets": "No explicit targets for untrusted data; no sinks or data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and defines module metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, importing deprecation utilities with no hidden or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module docstring and import statements from a known package (zope.deprecation). There are no dynamic evaluations, external data handling, or suspicious code patterns. It appears to serve as a utility or metadata module for deprecation management. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that manages deprecation warnings within the Zope framework. It contains standard imports and documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
