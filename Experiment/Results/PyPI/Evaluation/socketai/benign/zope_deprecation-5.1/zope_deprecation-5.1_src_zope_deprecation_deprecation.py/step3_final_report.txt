{
  "purpose": "This module provides utilities to manage deprecation warnings, backward compatibility, and module attribute handling through proxies and decorators.",
  "sources": "Code reads module attributes, sys.modules, sys._getframe(), and global variables.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued via warnings.warn, modifications to sys.modules and module attributes, dynamic imports.",
  "flows": "Access to deprecated names triggers warnings; deprecation proxies and decorators intercept attribute access; dynamic import in 'moved' function relocates modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys._getframe() and dynamic attribute manipulation are typical for deprecation utilities; no malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard deprecation handling mechanisms, including proxies, decorators, and warning suppression. It interacts with sys.modules and call stack introspection in a conventional manner. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. The use of sys._getframe() is common in such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent. The dynamic import in 'moved' could be misused if called with untrusted module names, but within a utility context, this is acceptable. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign deprecation utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
