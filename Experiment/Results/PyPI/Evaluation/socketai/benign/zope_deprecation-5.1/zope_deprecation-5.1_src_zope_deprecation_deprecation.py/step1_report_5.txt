{
  "purpose": "This module provides utilities for managing deprecation warnings and backward compatibility in Python code, including proxies and decorators to warn about deprecated features.",
  "sources": "Reads module attributes, function attributes, global variables, and frame globals to set or retrieve module and attribute states.",
  "sinks": "Uses warnings.warn to issue deprecation warnings, dynamically imports modules, and sets or deletes attributes on modules and objects.",
  "flows": "Accesses and modifies module attributes based on deprecation status; warnings triggered on attribute access; module import and attribute copying during 'moved' function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Uses standard Python features and warning mechanisms. No obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for deprecating features, issuing warnings, and managing backward compatibility. It interacts with sys.modules, frame globals, and object attributes in a conventional way. No suspicious network activity, no data exfiltration, no code injection, or hidden backdoors detected. The use of warnings and dynamic attribute management appears consistent with deprecation practices. No obfuscation or malware patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for managing deprecation warnings and backward compatibility. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It relies on standard Python warning and module systems, with no indicators of security risks.",
