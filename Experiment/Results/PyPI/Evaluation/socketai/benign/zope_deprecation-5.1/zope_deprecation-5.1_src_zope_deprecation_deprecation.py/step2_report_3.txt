  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a utility for managing deprecation warnings, module proxies, attribute wrappers, and backward compatibility.\n- The code relies on standard Python modules (sys, types, warnings) and common patterns like sys._getframe() for introspection.\n- No report indicates suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The use of dynamic attribute access and sys.modules modifications is typical for deprecation utilities.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, aligning with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it provides classes/functions for deprecating modules, functions, properties, and temporarily suppressing warnings.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The use of sys._getframe() is standard in such utilities, though it can be sensitive if misused, but here it appears appropriate.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only concern is the use of `sys._getframe()`, which can be sensitive if the code is called in untrusted contexts or if the caller manipulates the call stack. However, this is a common pattern in deprecation utilities and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The dynamic import in `moved()` could be misused if called with untrusted module names, but in this context, it is part of a deprecation mechanism.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (around 0.2) seems reasonable, reflecting potential misuse if called with untrusted input but not inherently risky.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard deprecation utility, not malicious.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or malware.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential misuse of dynamic features, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard deprecation utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that such utilities are used in trusted environments, especially when dynamic features like `sys._getframe()` and `__import__` are involved.",
