  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.deprecation Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst and CHANGES.rst files for long_description, and reading package info for setup.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted data or user input; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The script reads static files for metadata and passes these to setup functions without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly performs setup activities.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, defines a read function to load files, and configures package metadata via setuptools.setup. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior present. The use of standard setup functions and static file reading indicates a typical package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies, following best practices.",
