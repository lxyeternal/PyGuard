  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.deprecation Python package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and CHANGES.rst files for long description.",
  "sinks": "File read operations in the 'read' function, used for obtaining package description data.",
  "flows": "read() function reads from local files; setup() uses this data to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. No external network activity or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file utilizing setuptools for package configuration. It reads local files for package descriptions, defines dependencies, and sets package metadata. All operations involve local file I/O and package setup routines, which are typical for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated code. The code adheres to standard practices without any suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a conventional setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs package configuration and file reading operations.",
