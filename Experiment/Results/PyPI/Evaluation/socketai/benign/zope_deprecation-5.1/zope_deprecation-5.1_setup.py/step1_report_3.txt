  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the zope.deprecation Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description, importing standard libraries, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, package installation instructions, and dependency specification; no direct sink of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> setup configuration; no flow of untrusted data to potentially malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads static files for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated sections, or unusual logic. All functions and imports are standard and intended for package configuration. No source-to-sink data flows that could lead to security issues are present. The script relies solely on static file reads and standard setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
