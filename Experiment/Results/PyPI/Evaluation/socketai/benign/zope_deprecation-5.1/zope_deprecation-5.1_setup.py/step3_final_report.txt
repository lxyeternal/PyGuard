  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.deprecation Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading local files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description content.",
  "sinks": "None; static file reads do not process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "File reading functions load static documentation files; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and package data. It reads static documentation files for long description, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. The code structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate a benign package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs static file reads for documentation and package setup, with no external or untrusted data processing.",
