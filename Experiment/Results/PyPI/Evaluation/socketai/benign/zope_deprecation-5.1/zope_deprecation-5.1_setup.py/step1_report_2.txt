  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.deprecation package, including package metadata, dependencies, and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no untrusted data is processed beyond reading files.",
  "flows": "Reading files into long_description during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code follows standard setup.py conventions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads static files for descriptions, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic evaluations, no execution of untrusted data, nor any suspicious code logic. The use of 'os.path' and 'setuptools' is typical and secure. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional, benign setup configuration file for the zope.deprecation package. It does not contain malware, malicious code, or security risks.",
