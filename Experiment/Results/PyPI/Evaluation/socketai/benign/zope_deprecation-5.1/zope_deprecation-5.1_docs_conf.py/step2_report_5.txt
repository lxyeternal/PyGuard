  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the nature of the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation.\n- It contains no dynamic code, no external data processing, no network operations, no obfuscated or malicious code.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The code does not handle untrusted input, nor does it execute external commands.\n- The configuration is typical and standard for a Sphinx project.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain as-is.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward static configuration)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign, static configuration file with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores and analysis are appropriate.",
