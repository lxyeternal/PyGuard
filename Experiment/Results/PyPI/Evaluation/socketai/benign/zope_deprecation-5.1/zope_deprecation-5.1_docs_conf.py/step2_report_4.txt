  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the file as a static, standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or executable logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The code is purely for documentation setup with no security risks identified.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is static configuration data, with no dynamic or executable parts.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no network, file, or command execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or hidden logic.\n- **Secrets or credentials:** None present.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** No unusual code constructs or patterns.\n\n### Error, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the file as benign static configuration.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly reflecting no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with no security issues.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No evidence suggests any risk or malicious activity; therefore, a high score would be unjustified.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly conclude the file is safe.\n- No false positives or overestimations are present.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all are appropriately low or zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe file is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.",
