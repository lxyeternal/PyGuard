  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "Import statement (__import__('pkg_resources'))",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only declares namespace, no data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Importing pkg_resources, then calling declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string, which is typical for dynamic imports but not suspicious here; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__, indicating it is setting up a namespace package. There are no data inputs from external sources, no sinks that process untrusted data, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is a standard practice in Python namespace packages and does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard namespace package declaration using pkg_resources with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
