  "sources": "Import statement: __import__('pkg_resources')",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Importing pkg_resources, then calling declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "Usage of __import__() with string argument is dynamic, but this is standard practice for namespace packages; no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module dynamically and calls declare_namespace with __name__, which is typical in setting up namespace packages in Python. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious operations. No untrusted data sources or dangerous code execution paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for namespace package declaration and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
