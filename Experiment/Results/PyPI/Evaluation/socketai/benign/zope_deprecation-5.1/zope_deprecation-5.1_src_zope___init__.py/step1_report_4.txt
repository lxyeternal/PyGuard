  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The import statement accessing 'pkg_resources'",
  "sinks": "None present in this line",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace declarations; no suspicious behavior or anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__, which is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. This is a standard practice for package modularity and does not involve any input handling, data processing, or untrusted data flows. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package declaration and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. It simply sets up the package namespace as intended.",
