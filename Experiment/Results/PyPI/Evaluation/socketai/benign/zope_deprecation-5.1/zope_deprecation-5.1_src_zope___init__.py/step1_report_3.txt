  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks",
  "flows": "No data flow; just namespace declaration",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ for dynamic import; no malicious behavior but unusual in this context",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module dynamically and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python packaging to allow multiple distributions to share the same namespace. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The use of __import__ is a standard Python technique, though less common than static imports, and does not imply malicious intent here.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup snippet.",
