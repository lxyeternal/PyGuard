  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and uses 'declare_namespace' with the current module name.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares namespace scope.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, using a standard pattern for namespace packages; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' on __name__, which is a standard pattern to declare a namespace package in Python. This pattern is widely used and considered safe. No input handling, data processing, or network activity is present. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and functional for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
