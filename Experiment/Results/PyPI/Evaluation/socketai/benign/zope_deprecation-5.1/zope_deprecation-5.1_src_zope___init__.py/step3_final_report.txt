  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources in Python.",
  "sources": "The import of 'pkg_resources' via __import__('pkg_resources')",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' leading to declaration of namespace with __name__",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a standard namespace declaration pattern, straightforward and unobfuscated",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace with __name__, a common pattern for namespace packages. It involves no data sinks, network activity, or malicious constructs. The use of __import__() with a string is typical in such contexts. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is minimal, standard, and safe, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and high confidence in benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration in Python with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores. No further action or concern is warranted.",
