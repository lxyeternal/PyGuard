  "purpose": "A trivial variable assignment used for testing or as a placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external input, data reading, or data flow; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the assignment is straightforward with no source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, clear, and free of obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment 'abc = 1' with a comment indicating its use in tests. All reports confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is benign, serving as a placeholder or test variable, with no external dependencies or complex logic. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, trivial, and used for testing purposes. There are no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
