  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Legitimate waf configuration script managing environment, directories, tools, and build testing.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, files, sys.argv.\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, file system modifications, dynamic eval of functions.\n- **Flow:** Standard environment and build process.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no use of dangerous subprocess calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Typical build configuration code, well-structured, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, no malicious intent.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, standard build script)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar build configuration for a build automation tool.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, sys.argv, file reads.\n- **Sinks:** File writes, process execution, environment modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic eval_rules, detailed logging, no evident malicious payloads.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build system code, no signs of sabotage or malware.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Configuration script for waf, environment setup, tool discovery.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, file system, input parameters.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Typical build configuration code, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard build script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build environment setup, tool detection, build orchestration.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, user input, file system.\n- **Sinks:** Program execution, file system modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Legitimate build configuration code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build configuration, environment setup, tool loading.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, configuration files, user commands.\n- **Sinks:** External program execution, file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard waf build script, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe standard waf build configuration scripts, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, reflecting typical low-level operational risk of build scripts, not indicative of supply chain compromise.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — standard build system risk, not elevated.\n\n**Overall:** The reports collectively indicate this is a legitimate, non-malicious build configuration script for waf, with no signs of sabotage or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable given the analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
