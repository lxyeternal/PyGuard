{
  "purpose": "The script provides functionality to strip debugging symbols from compiled binaries as part of a build process, specifically using the waf build system.",
  "sources": "The code reads program source files and build configuration data (e.g., self.link_task outputs). It also reads environment variables and configuration for the strip program.",
  "sinks": "The 'strip' command is executed via the run_str attribute, which may invoke an external process that modifies binary files. The script also calls os.chmod to change file permissions.",
  "flows": "Build configuration data → create_task('strip') → execution of '${STRIP} ${STRIPFLAGS} ${SRC}' command that runs the strip utility on the target binary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The script straightforwardly invokes an external program ('strip') with parameters, typical for build scripts. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard build utility for stripping binaries, using environment variables and external commands. It ensures the strip utility exists and integrates into the build process, without any suspicious logic or malicious intent. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected. The code is typical for build automation and does not contain hidden or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign build utility intended for stripping debugging symbols from binaries. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It is a standard component of build pipelines.",
