  "purpose": "A build utility to strip debugging symbols from binaries post-linking using the waf build system.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'strip' program location via conf.find_program and the output files from link tasks.",
  "sinks": "The external 'strip' command invoked on build outputs; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "conf.find_program -> add_strip_task -> create_task('strip') -> executes '${STRIP} ${STRIPFLAGS} ${SRC}' on output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward build process.",
  "analysis": "The code locates the 'strip' utility, defines a Task class to run it, and hooks this task after linking. It uses environment detection and standard APIs. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the script. External command invocation is typical in build scripts, and no vulnerabilities are introduced. The code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The risk primarily depends on the environment, but as written, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard build utility for stripping binaries. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
