{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to strip debugging symbols from compiled binaries or libraries after their creation, typically to reduce file size or improve security by removing symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (via conf.env), program paths (via conf.find_program), and the link task outputs (link_task.outputs[0]) during task creation.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the external 'strip' program using the run_str command, which can potentially affect files if misused, but in this context, it is intended for legitimate binary stripping.",
  "flows": "The script locates the 'strip' program, adds flags, then creates a 'strip' task that takes the output of the linking task as input and runs the strip command on it.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to be a standard build tool script. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a build utility module intended for use with the waf build system. It finds the 'strip' program, sets up environment flags, and creates a task to run 'strip' on compiled outputs after linking. The use of environment variables and task creation appears standard. No external network activity, no data leakage, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The code aligns with legitimate build practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign build utility for stripping binaries, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, uses standard practices, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
