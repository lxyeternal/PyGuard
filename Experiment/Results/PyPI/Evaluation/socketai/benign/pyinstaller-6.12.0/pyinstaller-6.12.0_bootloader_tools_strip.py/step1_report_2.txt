{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility for stripping debug symbols and unnecessary sections from compiled programs or libraries after they are created, primarily for size reduction and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (e.g., 'STRIP'), external program 'strip', and task outputs during build process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'strip' command on build artifacts, which modifies binary files but does not involve untrusted input handling or data leakage.",
  "flows": "The build system finds the 'strip' program, configures the environment, then creates and runs a 'strip' task on output files of linking tasks, which calls the external 'strip' utility.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The code is standard for build scripting.",
  "analysis": "The script configures the build environment to locate the 'strip' utility, defines a task to run 'strip' on build outputs, and integrates this task into the build process after linking. It uses environment variables and external program calls in a typical manner. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The code appears to be a benign build utility intended for post-build optimization.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard build script component for stripping debug symbols from binaries. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code.",
