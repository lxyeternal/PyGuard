{
  "purpose": "This script is a build utility designed to strip debug symbols from compiled binaries after they are created, using the waf build system.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and environment data via the waflib API, and it reads the 'strip' program path via configure()",
  "sinks": "The code executes the 'strip' program on binaries, which can potentially be misused if the 'strip' program is malicious or overridden; however, this is a standard use case and not inherently malicious",
  "flows": "Configuration retrieves 'strip' program, which is then used in the run_str command to process output files of build tasks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward build utility without hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The script configures the build environment to find the 'strip' utility, defines a Task subclass to perform stripping of binaries, and hooks this task into the build process after linking. The logic is typical for build tools, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The usage of waflib APIs is standard, and there are no suspicious data flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build utility for stripping binaries, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs a standard function within build systems.",
