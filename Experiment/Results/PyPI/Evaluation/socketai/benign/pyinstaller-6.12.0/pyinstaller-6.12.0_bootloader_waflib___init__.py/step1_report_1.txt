  "purpose": "This code appears to be a script header with a warning comment, possibly part of a larger build or automation process related to waf.io.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a warning comment referencing an external URL and a shebang line; no actual executable code or suspicious instructions included.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang and a comment warning not to edit, referencing waf.io documentation. No executable logic, data input, or suspicious constructs are present. The comment may suggest integration with waf build automation, but in isolation, it does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, containing only a script header and a warning comment. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
