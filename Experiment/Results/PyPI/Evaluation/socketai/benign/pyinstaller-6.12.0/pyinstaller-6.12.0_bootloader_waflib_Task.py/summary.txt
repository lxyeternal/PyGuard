  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build framework that employs dynamic code execution, which poses inherent security risks if inputs are not sanitized. There is no evidence of active malware or malicious sabotage. The risk scores are appropriate, with the primary concern being the use of exec() on untrusted data. Proper input validation would mitigate these risks. Overall, the code is not malicious but should be used with caution regarding input sources."
