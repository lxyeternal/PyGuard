  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a build system, handling errors related to build failures, configuration issues, rescanning, and task readiness.",
  "sources": "Import statements: traceback, sys",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from or written to external sources or untrusted inputs within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink as the code is solely defining exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class, with constructors setting message and traceback information. The classes are designed for handling build system errors. No external data input, no network activity, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining error handling classes for a build system and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
