  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of custom exception classes for error handling within a build system context.\n- It captures traceback information and formats error messages.\n- There are no external inputs, network operations, file manipulations, or other potentially malicious behaviors.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code appears straightforward, purpose-specific, and secure.\n\n**Review of individual reports:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- They correctly identify that the code only manages exceptions and traceback formatting.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are observed.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Scores and their justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, unobfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or overestimations:**\n- No report suggests any reason to assign a higher risk score. Since the code is purely exception handling, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The malware score should remain 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated score remains 0, as the code is clear.\n\n**Final expert judgment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a build system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary.",
