{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to a build system or framework, with detailed traceback information.",
  "sources": "Exception initialization and traceback extraction, particularly in the WafError constructor.",
  "sinks": "Formatting of traceback information and error messages; no direct sink for untrusted input or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Error creation and propagation flow involving traceback extraction and message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard exception handling pattern. No hardcoded secrets, no network operations, and no external data inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class. WafError captures traceback details during instantiation, providing verbose error messages. Other classes extend WafError for specific error types. All operations are confined to error handling and traceback management without external data inputs or outputs. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard error handling classes for a build system, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any network, data theft, or harmful actions. The code is straightforward and secure.",
