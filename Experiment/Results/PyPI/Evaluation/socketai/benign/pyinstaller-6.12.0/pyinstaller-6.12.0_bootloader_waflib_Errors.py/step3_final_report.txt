  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within a build system, capturing traceback info and formatting error messages.",
  "sources": "Traceback extraction during exception instantiation, error message formatting",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data flow or network activity",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation triggers traceback collection and message formatting",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception handling code, no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception classes that manage traceback information and error messages. It does not perform any data input/output, network communication, or file operations. The traceback collection and message formatting are standard practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, purpose-specific, and adheres to common Python error handling patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The high confidence score (1) is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for error handling, with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and require no adjustment.",
