{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a build system, primarily used for error handling and reporting during build processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from exception arguments and traceback objects, which are internally generated during runtime errors.",
  "sinks": "The exception messages and traceback information could potentially be exposed or logged, but there are no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to external effects within this code.",
  "flows": "Input sources (error messages, exceptions, traceback info) are stored within exception objects, but there are no explicit flows to external sinks such as network or file outputs in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard for error handling in a build system.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with mechanisms to capture and format traceback information for debugging. The 'WafError' class captures traceback details, and its subclasses specify different error types. No data is transmitted externally, and no suspicious behavior, such as network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated logic, is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely implements error handling for a build system and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data exfiltration, command execution, or other malicious actions.",
