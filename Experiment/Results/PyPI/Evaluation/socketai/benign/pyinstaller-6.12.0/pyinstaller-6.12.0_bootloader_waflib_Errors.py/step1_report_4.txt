{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for a build automation framework, primarily for error handling and reporting during build processes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources; the code only defines classes and methods for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data; error messages are stored and formatted internally.",
  "flows": "Exception creation and handling flow: errors are instantiated and formatted internally, with no external data flow or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors. The code follows standard exception class design.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class. It includes detailed traceback collection and formatting for error reporting. No external data input, no network operations, no command execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The structure and content are typical for error handling in a build system. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for build error handling with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
