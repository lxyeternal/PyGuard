{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a build automation framework, with no apparent functional code beyond exception management.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; code only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely class definitions and error formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely implements custom exception classes for error reporting in a build system context. It manages error messages, traceback collection, and error formatting. There are no external input points, no data processing, and no potentially malicious actions such as network calls, file modifications, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be straightforward and purpose-specific, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of exception classes for a build system, with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. It is standard error handling code without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
