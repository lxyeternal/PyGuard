  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- All reports confirm that the code is purely defining custom exception classes for a build system, with no external data input/output, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- Traceback collection and error message formatting are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no external data leaks, no obfuscated code, and no malware indicators are present.\n- The confidence level in all reports is high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are consistently zero.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - No, the code only manages exception classes and traceback formatting.\n   - No evidence of malicious payloads, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured and typical for error handling.\n   - No flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification:**\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No reason to assign a higher score.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Assumption-based Vulnerability Claims:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - Valid and appropriate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** Purely exception class definitions with traceback management.\n- **Malware Potential:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** None.\n- **Overall Risk Estimate:** The code is standard, safe, and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n| Category          | Score |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Malware           | 0      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      |\n| Security Risk     | 0      |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is straightforward, well-understood, and contains no suspicious or malicious elements. The high confidence and zero scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes to the existing scores are necessary. The reports are consistent and accurate based on the code provided.",
