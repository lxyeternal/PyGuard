{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for building and packaging PyInstaller, including bootloader compilation, platform-specific resource management, and build process control.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., PYI_PLATFORM, PYINSTALLER_BOOTLOADER_WAF_ARGS), filesystem checks for bootloader files, subprocess calls to external build scripts ('./waf'), and package data configuration.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing external build commands, file existence checks, and environment variable usage influencing build behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence platform detection and build commands; subprocess calls execute build steps; file checks prevent unnecessary recompilation; environment variables affect build paths and options.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard build script practices.",
  "analysis": "The script manages build and packaging processes for PyInstaller, leveraging environment variables for platform-specific behavior and subprocess calls for bootloader compilation. It includes safeguards against redundant builds and enforces modern packaging standards. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident; subprocess calls and environment variable manipulations are typical in build systems. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or backdoors. The reliance on environment variables is standard but could be exploited if the environment is compromised, which is a general risk in build environments. Overall, the code is legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate build setup script for PyInstaller with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The scores assigned across reports—malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
