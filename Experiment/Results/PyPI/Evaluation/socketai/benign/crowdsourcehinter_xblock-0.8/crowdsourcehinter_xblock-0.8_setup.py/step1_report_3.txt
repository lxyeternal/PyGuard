{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the 'crowdsourcehinter-xblock' Python package, defining package data, requirements, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading files: README.md, requirements files, version file (__init__.py).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks involved in untrusted data handling; no data leaks or malicious actions directly observed.",
  "flows": "Input files (README.md, requirements, version) are read and parsed; data flows into package setup parameters and requirements lists.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the presence of a regex-based requirements parser, which does not pose security risk but is complex. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading long description, extracting version info, loading requirements, and configuring package data. Functions like 'load_requirements' and 'get_version' process files but do not execute untrusted code. No use of subprocesses, network calls, or dynamic imports that could be malicious. The regex for requirements parsing is safe, and there is no indication of malicious behavior or backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate setup code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. It reads package metadata and requirements securely without executing or manipulating untrusted data maliciously.",
