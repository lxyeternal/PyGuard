  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'crowdsourcehinter' XBlock package, handling package data, requirements, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, requirements files, and version info from __init__.py; processes static files and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is executed or transmitted; no dangerous data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads files (README, requirements, version), processes regex for requirements, and packages static assets.",
  "anomalies": "Mentions comments about SEMGREP modifications; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: file reading, regex parsing, and package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. Comments about SEMGREP are benign annotations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is due to static analysis comments but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
