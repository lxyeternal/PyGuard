{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class from a local module and sets a version string, serving as part of a package's initialization or module setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.crowdsourcehinter' module, setting '__version__' string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flows or external communications present",
  "flows": "Import statement and version assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import and assigns a version string, typical for package modules. There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and standard structure strongly suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
