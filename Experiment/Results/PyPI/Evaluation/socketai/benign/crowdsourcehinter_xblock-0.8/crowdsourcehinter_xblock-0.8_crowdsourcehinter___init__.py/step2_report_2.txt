  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a minimal, straightforward import statement from a local module (`.crowdsourcehinter`) and a version string assignment.\n- No data flows, external inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The import and version assignment are correct and straightforward.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The analysis correctly states no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, confidence = 1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code is minimal and benign.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 0.9 (slightly less than 1, but still high).\n- **Note:** The confidence score is slightly lower, possibly reflecting the minimal nature of the code, but this is reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- **Malware and security risk scores:** All are zero, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** All are zero, as expected.\n- **Confidence scores:** Mostly 1, with one at 0.9, which is acceptable given the simplicity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** Should remain at 0.0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0.0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0.0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's simplicity.",
