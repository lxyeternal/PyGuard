  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a relative import of `CrowdsourceHinter` from `.crowdsourcehinter` and a version string.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 in all cases, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which seems reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0), indicating the reviewers agree on benignity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The import statement is standard for modular Python code.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The code is minimal, serving only to import a class and set a version string.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code fragment is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Issues in the reports:\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk are consistent and reasonable.**  \n- **The confidence scores are high, which is justified.**  \n- **No changes needed in the scoring.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the code is a simple import statement, there is no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.1.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature and do not overstate any potential issues.\n- The code's minimal and straightforward nature strongly suggests no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all reports and analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0   |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risks are present.  \n- The code is standard practice for importing modules and setting version info.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are accurate in their benign assessment.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, securityRisk = 0.0.",
