  "purpose": "Importing the CrowdsourceHinter class from a local module and defining the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.crowdsourcehinter'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; no source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module and a version string assignment. There are no input handling, data processing, or output operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The import is standard practice for modular Python code. No obfuscated or complex code constructs are present. The minimal nature indicates no embedded malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, serving only to import a class and set a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
