  "purpose": "Importing the 'CrowdsourceHinter' class from a local module for use within the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.crowdsourcehinter' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads a class from a local module; no data flows from external sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import of a local class and sets a version string. No external data handling, no execution of dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns are evident. The import from a relative module is standard practice, assuming the module is part of the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with version assignment; there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
