  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n```python\nfrom .crowdsourcehinter import CrowdsourceHinter\n\n__version__ = '0.8'\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, benign import, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues identified.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, benign import, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, minimal code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same benign assessment.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, minimal import, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is straightforward, performing only an import and setting a version string.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; all reports agree on malware score 0.0.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent; the code is minimal and benign.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports and the simplicity of the code, I agree with the current scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**However**, if I were to assign an overall risk score based on the code alone, I would also keep it at 0.0, as there's no indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.**\n- **No changes to scores are necessary.**\n- **The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**\n\n**Final note:** No further action required. The code appears safe and well-understood.",
