  "purpose": "This code implements an xblock for providing hints to students based on their incorrect answers, with functionalities for hint management, ratings, and reporting within an edX course.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'data' parameters in JSON handlers such as 'submittedanswer', 'student_answer', 'hint', 'student_rating', 'new_hint_submission', 'answer', and 'generic_hints'; user data from 'xmodule_runtime' to determine staff status; static resources loaded from resource strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points include storing and manipulating user answers, hints, ratings, and report statuses; also, the resource_string method loads static resources which could be manipulated if compromised, but by itself is safe.",
  "flows": "User inputs such as submitted answers flow into 'get_hint' and 'rate_hint' handlers, affecting 'hint_database' and 'reported_hints'; 'add_new_hint' allows students to add hints, which update 'hint_database'; 'extract_student_answers' parses submitted form data. The flow of data is primarily within internal data structures, with external data coming from user submissions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or secrets. The only dynamic external data is user input, which is sanitized through decoding and parsing. No code injection, unsafe SQL, or insecure environment variable use detected. Use of random.choice for generic hints is benign. No obfuscated code patterns or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an educational hint system with multiple data management functions. It uses safe Python practices and libraries. All data inputs are from user submissions or static resources, with no direct execution of untrusted code, and no external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms. The 'rate_hint' and 'add_new_hint' handlers modify internal dictionaries based on user input, but without suspicious logic. The only potential concern is the possibility of malicious hints being added or reported, but this is part of intended functionality, not malicious code. No signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security exploits are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard educational hint management system with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely manages user input, ratings, and reports, with no evidence of malware or sabotage. The overall security risk score is low.",
