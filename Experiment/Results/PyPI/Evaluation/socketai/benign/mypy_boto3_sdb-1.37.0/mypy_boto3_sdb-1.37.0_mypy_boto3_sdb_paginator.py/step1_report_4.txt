{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 sdb service client, providing type hints and documentation links for pagination methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods using **kwargs for pagination.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows detected; class methods simply return paginator objects with type hints.",
  "flows": "The code defines paginator classes with paginate methods that accept flexible keyword arguments, returning iterators over results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. Code adheres to standard type annotation patterns, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for type annotations, defines paginator classes inheriting from generic Paginator with specific result types. The paginate methods accept flexible parameters and return iterators as intended. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard type hinting implementation for boto3 paginator wrappers, with documentation links included. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed directly; the code is mainly for static typing and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 sdb client. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated or harmful code segments. The code is safe and intended to facilitate static type checking.",
