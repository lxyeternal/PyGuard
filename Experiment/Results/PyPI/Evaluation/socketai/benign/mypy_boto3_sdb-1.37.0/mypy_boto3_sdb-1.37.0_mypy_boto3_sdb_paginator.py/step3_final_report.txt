  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 sdb, providing static typing support for list_domains and select operations.",
  "sources": "Imports, class definitions, method signatures accepting **kwargs for pagination parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; methods accept **kwargs but do not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Method signatures accept **kwargs, which are passed to boto3 paginator methods without processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs with Unpack is standard for boto3 API wrappers; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining paginator classes with type annotations, conditional imports for type checking, and documentation links. It does not process external data or execute dynamic code. The handling of **kwargs is typical for boto3 and does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static type support for boto3 sdb paginators. All signals indicate no malicious activity or security risks. The minor concern about untrusted kwargs is inherent to boto3's design and does not constitute a security issue.",
