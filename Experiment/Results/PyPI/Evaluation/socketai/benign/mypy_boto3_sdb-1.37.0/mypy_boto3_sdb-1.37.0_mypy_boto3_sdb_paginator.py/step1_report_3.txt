  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the sdb service client, facilitating paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods that accept **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs of specific types, which are used as arguments for paginator functions. No data is processed or transmitted here.",
  "flows": "The paginate methods receive type-defined arguments (**kwargs) and return PageIterator objects containing the result types. No untrusted data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is primarily class and method definitions with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two paginator classes inheriting from generic Paginator with specific result types. It imports and applies type annotations to ensure correct usage. No dynamic execution, data manipulation, or external data handling is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns for typing boto3 paginator classes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of paginator classes with type annotations for boto3 sdb service. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and is safe based on the provided content.",
