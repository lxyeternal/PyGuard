  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 sdb service client, facilitating type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, typing, botocore.paginate, custom type_defs), class method parameters (kwargs), and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include kwargs in paginate methods which accept untrusted input; no direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "kwargs in paginate methods could potentially flow from untrusted sources, but as this code does not process input directly, no malicious data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code primarily defines type annotations and class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for type hinting and pagination, defines classes for paginator wrappers, and annotates methods with detailed documentation links. The classes extend Paginator with specified type parameters. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or network operations are present. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and focused on static typing support. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured type annotation and class wrapper for boto3 sdb paginators, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
