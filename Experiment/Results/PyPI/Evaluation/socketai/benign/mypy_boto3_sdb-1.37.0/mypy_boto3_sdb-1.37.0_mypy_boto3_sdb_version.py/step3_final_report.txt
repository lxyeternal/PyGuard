  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string with a copyright comment.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, accompanied by a copyright comment. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data input, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security or functionality. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and confidence is high (1). The code is standard boilerplate for versioning in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version declaration with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
