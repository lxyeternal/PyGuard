  "sources": "The string assignment '__version__ = \"1.37.0\"'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a copyright notice and a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or any suspicious patterns. The presence of a copyright statement is standard practice. The version number is hardcoded but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is standard boilerplate code used for package versioning.",
