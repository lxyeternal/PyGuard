  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and evaluate the code and scoring.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that assigns a static string to `__version__`.\n- Contains only a copyright comment and a version assignment.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- No data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.\n- The version number is hardcoded, with a future copyright year (2025), which is an inconsistency but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code is benign, simple, and standard for version declaration.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n- They note the future copyright year, which is an inconsistency but not an error that impacts security.\n- No flaws or mistakes in reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk and malware scores\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Malware score is 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n### Step 5: Challenge assumptions\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is a minimal version declaration.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- The code is entirely benign and standard.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, standard version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are accurate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep scores as-is:\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **securityRisk:** 0",
