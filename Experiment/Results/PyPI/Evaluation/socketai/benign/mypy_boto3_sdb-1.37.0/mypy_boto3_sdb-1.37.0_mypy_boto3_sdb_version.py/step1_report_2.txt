  "purpose": "Defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright date (2025) instead of current year, which might be an inconsistency, but not malicious. No suspicious code patterns or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string to the __version__ variable and contains a comment with a copyright notice. There are no functions, external data reads, or suspicious code constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as metadata for the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
