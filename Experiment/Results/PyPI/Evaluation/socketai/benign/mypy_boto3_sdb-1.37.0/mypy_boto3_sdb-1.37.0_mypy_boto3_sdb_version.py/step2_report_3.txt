  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__` with accompanying comments and copyright notices.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues, malicious code, or anomalies are present in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**  \n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign and standard.  \n- They mention a future copyright date (2025), which is unusual but not malicious—more likely a typo or planning for future use.  \n- No logical errors or flaws are identified.  \n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign scores: `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`.  \n- These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.  \n- No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is correct.  \n- No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities justifies a higher score.  \n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code analysis.  \n- No malicious activity detected or suspected.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports avoid assumptions; they state that the code is a standard version declaration.  \n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not suspicious.  \n**Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.  \n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration typical in Python packages. It contains no input handling, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns. The comments and copyright notice are benign.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the existing assessments.**",
