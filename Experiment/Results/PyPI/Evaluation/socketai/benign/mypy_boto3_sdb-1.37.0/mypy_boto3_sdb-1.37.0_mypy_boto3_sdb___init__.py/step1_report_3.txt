  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the sdb service, including documentation and type hints.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.client and .paginator), and module-level string documentation.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, no external outputs, no data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly sets up imports and aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward module interface with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module interface that imports classes and functions from local modules, assigns an alias, and exports symbols. It contains documentation and licensing info. No data input, external communication, or data processing occurs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with documentation and class imports, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
