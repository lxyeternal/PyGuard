  "purpose": "Interface module for AWS SimpleDB service, providing class imports and documentation.",
  "sources": "No external input; imports from local modules (.client, .paginator).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static imports and assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, sets an alias, and defines __all__. It contains documentation and no dynamic or network activity. The only unusual aspect is the future date, which does not pose security risks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are mostly appropriate; minor overestimation of risk in some cases due to the date anomaly. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple interface module with no malicious intent or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score approximately 0 or 0.1 to reflect the minor anomaly.",
