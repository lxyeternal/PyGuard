  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals and enumerations for boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys module), type alias definitions, string literals for various AWS resource, region, and paginator names.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data is processed or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code consists of static type definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden logic. The code is purely declarative with standard usage of type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides static type definitions for AWS resource names and pagination identifiers, adapting based on Python version. It imports sys for version checking and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions. The literal definitions are straightforward and do not involve dynamic code execution or external data handling. There are no obfuscated elements, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The structure is clean, intended for static type hinting support, and contains no runtime logic or data processing that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely declarative, serving as type annotations for AWS SDK resource names. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
