  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and consistency of scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, resources, regions, and pagination options.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No data processing, external input/output, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network activity.\n- The purpose is solely for type safety and documentation support in boto3 stubs.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS service literals; imports from sys and typing_extensions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. Serves as a static type reference.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent and accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defines string literal types with compatibility considerations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies, malicious code, or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—type annotations for AWS resource names, with version check.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines constants and type aliases for AWS services/resources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no external data, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on AWS SDB service literals, similar pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data flow, no external input, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary**\n\n- **Code Content:** Purely static type annotations and constants.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; code is straightforward.\n- **Data Flow:** None; no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports correctly assign zero to malware and security risk, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment & Recommendations**\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0** — no security threat or attack surface.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static type annotation module intended for static analysis, documentation, and type safety in boto3 SDK stubs. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that the source of such type definition modules is trusted, but based on the provided content and analysis, there are no security concerns here.",
