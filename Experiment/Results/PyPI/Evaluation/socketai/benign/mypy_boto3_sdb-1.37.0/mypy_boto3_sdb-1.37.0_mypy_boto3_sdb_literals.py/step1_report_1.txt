  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals used in boto3 stubs for enhanced type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions; definitions of string Literal types for various AWS services and resources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily consists of type annotations and constant definitions with no data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime data flow, only static type annotations and string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, primarily static type alias definitions. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, then declares multiple string literal type aliases for AWS services and resources. It includes comprehensive lists of AWS service names, resource names, and regions, with no dynamic or external data handling. No external input, no processing logic, no potential data leaks, and no network activity. It appears to be a standard type annotation module for boto3 stubs, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation definition module for AWS boto3 stubs. It contains no malicious code, no data flows, and no suspicious behaviors. It serves purely as a static type reference, and poses no security threat.",
