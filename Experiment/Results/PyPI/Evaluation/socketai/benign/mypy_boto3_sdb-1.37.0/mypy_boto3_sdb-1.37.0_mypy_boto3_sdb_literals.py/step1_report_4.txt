{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service and resource names for use with type annotations in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, string literals assigned to variables, and module-level string literal definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; code only defines constants and type aliases without data flow or external input/output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward type definitions with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines a series of string literal type aliases representing AWS service names, resource types, and pagination identifiers. These definitions facilitate type checking and documentation consistency for boto3 stubs. No dynamic execution, data manipulation, or external data handling occurs. The code is purely declarative, serving as constants and type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module containing type aliases and constants for AWS service identifiers. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be an intentionally simple and safe type definition module.",
