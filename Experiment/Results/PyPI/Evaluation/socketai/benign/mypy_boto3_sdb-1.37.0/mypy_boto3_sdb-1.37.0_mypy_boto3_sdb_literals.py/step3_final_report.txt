  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS service, resource, region, and pagination string literals to enhance type safety and documentation in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Defines string literal types and constants; imports 'Literal' conditionally based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions without data flow or external input/output.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type alias assignments.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type definitions for AWS services, resources, regions, and pagination options, with conditional import for 'Literal' for compatibility. No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or external data handling is present. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are included. The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support for boto3 stubs. All indicators point to benign, static, and well-structured code with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static type annotation module serving documentation and type safety purposes. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are accurate and appropriate.",
