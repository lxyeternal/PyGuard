  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service names, resource types, and pagination options with compatibility for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' and 'typing', and definitions of string literal types for various AWS-related identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code purely defines type annotations without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward type alias definitions for documentation and type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version >= 3.12. It then declares multiple string literal types for various AWS services, resource names, paginator options, and regions. All definitions are static and do not execute or handle data dynamically. No input handling, external data processing, or code execution occurs. The file's purpose is to provide type hints, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type alias definitions intended to enhance code correctness and documentation clarity. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activities are present.",
