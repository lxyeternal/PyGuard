  "purpose": "Define type annotations and literals for AWS services and pagination names used in boto3 sdb service.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version check for typing import, and the assignment of Literal types for various AWS resource and operation names.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks exists in this static type definitions module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward type annotation definitions with no dynamic or unsafe behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then declares multiple Literal type aliases for AWS resource names, operation names, and regions. All definitions are static and serve as type hints for other code modules. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The purpose appears to be purely for static type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type annotation module for AWS service literals. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward, static type definitions file with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
