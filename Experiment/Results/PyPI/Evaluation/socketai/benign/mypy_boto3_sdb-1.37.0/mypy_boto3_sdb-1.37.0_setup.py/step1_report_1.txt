{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'mypy-boto3-sdb'.",
  "sources": "Reads the script file itself for package metadata and the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves handling untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: reading static files to provide package metadata for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a well-known setup function from setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, then calls setup() with static metadata parameters such as name, version, author, URL, description, classifiers, keywords, and dependencies. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data sources. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no suspicious behavior.",
