  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and reading a README file for description.",
  "sources": "Reads the local file 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads local file content; no data flows involving untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, static setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a local markdown file for description and defines package info, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic inputs, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted data. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All security signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with appropriate scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. No further action or modification is necessary.",
