  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-sdb package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data inputs or outputs at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reading file content to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION, then passing static parameters to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be a standard setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib and setuptools to configure package setup. It reads the README.md for the long description. All data used in setup() are static strings or derived from the filesystem at runtime, with no user input or external untrusted sources. The dependencies are specified with a version constraint. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is typical for a Python package setup and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
