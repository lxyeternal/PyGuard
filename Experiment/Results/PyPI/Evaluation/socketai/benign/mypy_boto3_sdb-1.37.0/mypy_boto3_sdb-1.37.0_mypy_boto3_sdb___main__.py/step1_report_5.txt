  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), sys.stdout (output streams).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (printing information).",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version; otherwise, print_info is called.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for input/output handling and defines functions to print package info and version. The main() function processes command-line arguments, displaying version info if '--version' is present, otherwise showing package details. The script runs main() if executed directly. There are no network calls, no code injections, no data leaks, or suspicious operations. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears to be a benign CLI utility for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that displays package information and version details. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
