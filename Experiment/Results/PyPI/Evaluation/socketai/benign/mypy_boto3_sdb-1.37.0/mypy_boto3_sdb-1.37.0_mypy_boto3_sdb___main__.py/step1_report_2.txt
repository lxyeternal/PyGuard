  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point for a package related to boto3 SimpleDB, providing information about the package and its version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs information via sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout based on input arguments.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments triggers functions that output package info or version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic execution or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for a '--version' argument to display the package version; otherwise, it prints package info. It only reads from sys.argv and writes to sys.stdout, with no external network, file operations, or untrusted data processing. No hidden or malicious code observed. The code is straightforward and contains no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
