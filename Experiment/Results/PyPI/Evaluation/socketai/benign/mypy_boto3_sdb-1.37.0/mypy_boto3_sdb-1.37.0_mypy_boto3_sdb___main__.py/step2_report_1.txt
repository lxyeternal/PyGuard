  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info and version.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.\n   - The code is simple, with clear functions, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the script is benign and static.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely static and intended for informational purposes, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The reports' scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - They correctly state that no suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is benign, static, and has no security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a minimal, safe CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
