  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic data, network calls, or external dependencies are involved.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code segments are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with functions clearly delineating output operations.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident; the analysis is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the script.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n   - Since the code only outputs static information and does not perform any suspicious operations, a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is correct, as the code is clear and readable.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities and Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no assumptions or vulnerabilities based on the provided code.\n   - No supply chain risks or malicious payloads are suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's behavior.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying static package info.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The provided scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script. There are no discrepancies or overlooked issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and has no security risks.  \n- The scores given are appropriate and should remain at 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
