  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that outputs package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, outputs information to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "User inputs '--version' -> calls print_version() -> outputs version info; otherwise -> calls print_info() -> outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script functions solely as a command-line utility to display static package information. It reads command-line arguments, then prints predefined strings to standard output. No user input validation issues, no external data fetching, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward, with clear separation of concerns and no complex or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility designed to display static package and version information. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code.",
