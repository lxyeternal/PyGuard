  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details.",

  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) → output via stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that displays package info or version based on arguments. It does not perform network activity, handle untrusted input, or execute dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is simple and transparent, with no suspicious constructs or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, static, and intended solely for informational output. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
