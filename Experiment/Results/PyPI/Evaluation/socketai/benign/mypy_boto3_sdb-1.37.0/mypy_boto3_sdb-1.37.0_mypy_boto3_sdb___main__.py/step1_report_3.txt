  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; no untrusted input handling beyond command-line arguments",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version(), which outputs version; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily outputs static information about a package and its version, triggered by command-line arguments. It reads command-line args via sys.argv and outputs via sys.stdout.write. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or network interactions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code structure is straightforward, with clear functions and no hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues based on the provided code.",
