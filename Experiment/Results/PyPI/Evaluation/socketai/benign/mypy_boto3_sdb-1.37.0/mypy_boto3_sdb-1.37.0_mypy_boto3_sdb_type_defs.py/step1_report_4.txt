  "purpose": "Type annotations and structured data definitions for sdb service in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, conditional imports based on sys.version_info, type definitions for TypedDict with NotRequired annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data, no network or I/O operations, no eval or exec statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to dangerous sinks is present; mostly static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code primarily consists of static type definitions and import logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations for boto3 sdb service, with conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic execution, network activity, or input handling is present. The code appears to be a straightforward set of type definitions and import compatibility code, with no malicious or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type definitions module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It includes no external data handling, network operations, or obfuscated logic. Its purpose is to provide type hints for static analysis.",
