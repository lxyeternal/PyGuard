{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for sdb service data structures used in Python projects",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, typing, and typing_extensions; class definitions with annotations",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data; primarily type hints and structured data definitions",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to vulnerable sinks; only type annotations and class structures",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed; code appears to be straightforward type definitions",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for SDB service requests and responses, with conditional imports based on Python version. No data input/output handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The structure is consistent with type definition modules, and there are no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign collection of type definitions for AWS SDB interactions. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks detected. It simply aids in type checking and code clarity.",
