  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for Amazon SDB service interactions, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, conditional imports based on Python version, and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or execution; no input handling or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code purely defines type structures without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports based on Python version are standard; no suspicious or malicious code detected. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It includes documentation comments and a comprehensive list of exported symbols. There are no input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution features that could be exploited maliciously. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard practices for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that defines data structures for Amazon SDB interactions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The conditional imports are standard for compatibility and do not pose security issues.",
