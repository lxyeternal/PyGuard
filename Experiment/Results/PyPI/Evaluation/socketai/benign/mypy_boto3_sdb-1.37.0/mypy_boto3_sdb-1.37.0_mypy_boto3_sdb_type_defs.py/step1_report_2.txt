{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and documentation setup for the sdb service, providing type hints and structured data models for use with boto3.",
  "sources": "The code reads static documentation strings, imports system version info, and imports type modules (typing, typing_extensions, builtins).",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks for untrusted data or code execution are present; no data handling or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines data structures; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and standard for type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports based on Python version to ensure compatibility, and defines various TypedDict classes for data modeling. It includes documentation and licensing comments. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious patterns are detected. The code solely serves as type annotations and documentation, which is standard for SDK type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and consists of type definitions, documentation, and compatibility handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
