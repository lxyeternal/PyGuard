  "purpose": "Type annotations for sdb service type definitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime data sinks or external data flows; the code is purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing; the code only defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains standard type definitions with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static type definitions for AWS SDB, using conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no runtime logic, external input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code is well-structured, documented, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS SDB interactions, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
