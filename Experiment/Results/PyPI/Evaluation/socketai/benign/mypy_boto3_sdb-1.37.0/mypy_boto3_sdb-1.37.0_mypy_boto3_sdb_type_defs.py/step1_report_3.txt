{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the sdb service for improved code clarity and type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definition classes, and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable parts are not apparent; the code primarily defines data structures with no active data processing or external input/output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of type annotations and conditional imports appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for the sdb service, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It includes no executable logic, external data handling, or network operations. No suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or malicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a standard, well-structured type definition module intended for type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type definitions for AWS sdb service interaction. No malicious or security-threatening behaviors are detected. It’s a standard auxiliary module with no signs of malware or security risks.",
