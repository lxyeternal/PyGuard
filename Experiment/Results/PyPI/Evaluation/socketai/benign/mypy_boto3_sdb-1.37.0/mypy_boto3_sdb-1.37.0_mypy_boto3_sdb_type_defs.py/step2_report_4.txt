  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code contains only documentation, import statements, and type annotations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK type stub module.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign, purely defines type annotations, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard type definitions with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward type definitions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous, no dynamic code, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, benign type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking Scores & Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All 0, as there are no vulnerabilities, input handling, or external code execution paths.\n\n### Final Estimation:\nGiven the analysis, the scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No security risks or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a standard, safe set of type definitions with no malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
