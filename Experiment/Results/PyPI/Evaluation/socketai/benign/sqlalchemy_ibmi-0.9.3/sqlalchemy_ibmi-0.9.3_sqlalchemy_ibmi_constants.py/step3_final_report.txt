{
  "purpose": "A static set of reserved words likely used for SQL or database parsing/validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the hardcoded set of strings in the RESERVED_WORDS dictionary.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or produce external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the set is static and used for validation purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward static collection with comments about certain words, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, hardcoded set of reserved words with no dynamic logic, input handling, or external interactions. It contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. Comments about words like 'data' are benign and do not impact security. The code's purpose appears to be for validation or parsing within a larger system, such as SQL query validation. All previous reports correctly identified its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static list of reserved words with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use in validation contexts and does not pose any threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
