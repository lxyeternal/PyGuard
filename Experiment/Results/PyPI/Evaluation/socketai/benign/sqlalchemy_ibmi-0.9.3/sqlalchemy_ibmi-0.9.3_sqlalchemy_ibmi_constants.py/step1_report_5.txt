{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of reserved words, likely for use in a SQL or database context, as a constant set of keywords.",
  "sources": "The data is a static set of string literals assigned to a variable, no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output functions are present; the code only initializes a data structure.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows since the code only contains a static set definition.",
  "anomalies": "The set contains a comprehensive list of reserved SQL keywords, including some that are commented as problematic (e.g., 'data'). No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code merely defines a set of reserved words, likely for SQL parsing or validation purposes. The set is extensive and includes standard SQL keywords, with comments indicating some anomalies (e.g., 'data') that are intentionally included. No external inputs, outputs, or suspicious logic are present. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static definition of reserved words used for SQL or database-related parsing. It contains no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The only potential concern is the inclusion of certain words like 'data' which are commented on, but this does not affect security or functionality.",
