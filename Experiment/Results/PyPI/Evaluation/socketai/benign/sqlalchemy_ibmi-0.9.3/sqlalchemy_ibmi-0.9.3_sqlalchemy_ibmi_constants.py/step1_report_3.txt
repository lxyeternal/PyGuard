  "purpose": "Definition of a set of reserved words likely used for SQL or database-related operations.",
  "sources": "This code only defines a constant set; it does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The set is extensive but appears to be a comprehensive list of reserved words; no unusual or suspicious entries. The comment about 'data' indicates awareness of potential issues, but no active code or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "This code solely defines a set of reserved words, likely for use in parsing, validation, or query generation. There are no input sources, data manipulations, or output sinks. The set contains common SQL keywords and some additional terms, including comments noting potential complications with 'data'. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The structure and content are typical for a reserved words list used in database or query context. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static list of reserved words, intended for use as a reference or validation set. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign component, likely part of a larger system that validates or processes SQL or database identifiers.",
