  "sources": "The code itself is a static data structure, with no external input or data read operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths are present, as this is a static set definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a static set of reserved words with no active logic, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The comment about 'data' being listed but not needing quotes is benign and related to formatting. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a large set of reserved words, likely for SQL or similar language parsing. It is static, does not process input, and contains no active code logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The comment regarding 'data' is benign. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static set of reserved words used for language or query validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
