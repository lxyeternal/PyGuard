  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static set of reserved words, used for SQL or similar parsing.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or network activity is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining a large set of strings.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a static set of reserved words, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and benign.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar reasoning; emphasizes the static nature and benign intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion; notes no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with others; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also finds no malicious behavior; comments on some words being commented as problematic but benign.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code contains no malicious payload, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, appropriate for static data definitions.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor note is that some comments mention words like 'data' that could be problematic in certain contexts, but that is a comment, not code behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the existing scores.\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, static set of reserved words with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe, static, and non-malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
