{
  "purpose": "Definition of a set of reserved words, likely for use in SQL or database-related parsing or validation.",
  "sources": "The entire code is a static set declaration; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as there is no execution or data handling beyond the static set definition.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input, or output paths; this is simply a data structure definition.",
  "anomalies": "The set includes many common SQL reserved words, comments mention exceptions for 'data'. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are observed. The set appears to be comprehensive but static.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a set of reserved words, possibly for SQL parsing or validation. No dynamic code, no data input/output, no suspicious function calls. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The only potential concern is if this set is misused in a malicious context (e.g., for bypassing filters), but this cannot be inferred from the set alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of reserved words intended for use in SQL or database context. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
