{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of reserved words, likely for use in SQL or query parsing, to prevent their misuse or to recognize them as keywords.",
  "sources": "The source is a hardcoded Python set containing strings of reserved words.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; the set is static and used as a reference.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply initializes a static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external interactions are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of a static set of strings representing reserved words. There are no functions, input handling, or operations that could be malicious. The set may be used in other parts of a larger application to validate or recognize reserved keywords. It does not include any malicious behavior, external network activity, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static set of reserved words used likely for query or syntax validation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leakage, no backdoors, and no suspicious operations. It is safe from a security perspective.",
