  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a static set of reserved words, likely for SQL or query parsing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no data flow, no external dependencies, no obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, which aligns with the static nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms static reserved words for SQL/database validation.\n- **Findings:** No input/output, no suspicious activity, comments are benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0; appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar, static reserved words list, typical for SQL validation.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no external data, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Static reserved words list, with comments about exceptions.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic or malicious activity, only a comprehensive set.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Static list of reserved words, includes comments about certain words.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation or malicious activity, only a static data structure.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a static set of reserved words with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- The comments about 'data' and other words are benign and do not indicate any security concern.\n- No changes needed; the code appears safe and standard for its purpose.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis static list of reserved words is a common component in SQL parsers or validators and poses no security threat.",
