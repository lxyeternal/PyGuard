  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a static set of reserved words with no malicious behavior. The conclusion that it's safe and contains no malware or security risks is justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified given the static nature and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the code is a static set of reserved words with no active logic or malicious intent. The mention of the comment about 'data' is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, correctly notes that the code is a static list of reserved words, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Accurately describes the code as a static set of reserved words, with no active or suspicious logic. The mention of comments about 'data' is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is a static list of reserved words, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The comments about 'data' are noted but do not imply malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** Static set of reserved words, likely for SQL or database parsing/validation.\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Security Risks:** None detected in any report.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** All reports are highly confident (1), which is justified given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**In conclusion, the reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign static set of reserved words with no security concerns.**",
