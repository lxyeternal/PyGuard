  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code structure, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, imported modules, potential network or file operations, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic code execution or obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), complex or misleading variable names, suspicious data flows, potential hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no explicit malicious payloads or suspicious system calls in the provided snippets. Reports identify potential obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent but are not definitive alone. The suspicion is moderate, with scores reflecting cautious concern. No concrete evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, system damage, or covert backdoors is observed. The overall structure appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs beyond suspicion. The scores assigned across reports are consistent with the analysis, with malware suspicion kept low due to lack of confirmed malicious behavior. Dynamic execution and obfuscation are noted but not confirmed as malicious, leading to moderate malware and obfuscation scores. The risk score remains low to moderate, aligning with the cautious assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the available analysis, with some suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic code features that warrant monitoring. No definitive malicious activity is detected. The scores are appropriately cautious, reflecting potential risks without overestimating threat levels.",
