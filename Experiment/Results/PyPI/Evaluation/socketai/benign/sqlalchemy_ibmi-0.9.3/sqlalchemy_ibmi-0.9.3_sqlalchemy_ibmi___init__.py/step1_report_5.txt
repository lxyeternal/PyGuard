  "purpose": "This init file appears to set up module metadata and imports a local package, likely for package initialization or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import base'",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or external data flows",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed; license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license comments, version declaration, and a single import statement of a local module. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or sensitive data handling occurs. The license and author comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The import statement is typical for Python packages to include local modules. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This init file is standard package setup code with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected. It primarily contains licensing information and a simple import statement, which is typical and safe.",
