  "purpose": "Standard package initialization with licensing and version info",
  "sources": "License comments, version string, import statement",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file containing licensing comments, a version declaration, and a single import of a local module. It does not perform any data input/output, dynamic execution, network activity, or contain suspicious patterns. All indicators point to benign, boilerplate code typical for Python packages. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package initialization file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and justified.",
