  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, including path modifications, extension settings, and project info.",
  "sources": "sys.path modification, import of sqlalchemy_ibmi for version info",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Import of sqlalchemy_ibmi for version retrieval, sys.path modification for module resolution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard configuration code with benign import and setup tasks",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script. It modifies sys.path to include the parent directory, mocks the 'sqlalchemy' import for documentation purposes, and attempts to import 'sqlalchemy_ibmi' solely to retrieve its version. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The use of mock imports and version retrieval is standard practice. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
