  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, primarily to specify project info, extensions, and paths.",
  "sources": "sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..')) and import statements, especially 'import sqlalchemy_ibmi'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup code initializes environment and paths only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'sys.path.insert' to modify module search path and import of 'sqlalchemy_ibmi' with version extraction are typical for setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It modifies sys.path for module discovery and sets project-specific variables. The only imported module 'sqlalchemy_ibmi' is used solely to retrieve version info, which is a common pattern. No malicious or suspicious code behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs setup tasks only and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
