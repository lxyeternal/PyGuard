  "purpose": "Configuration for the Sphinx documentation builder, setting up project details, paths, extensions, and themes.",
  "sources": "import statements (os, sys), sys.path insertion, version import attempt, extension and path definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leaks or harmful actions; no untrusted data flows to critical functions.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely sets configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code appears consistent with standard Sphinx configuration practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path to include parent directory, and sets up project and documentation parameters. It attempts to import a version string from 'sqlalchemy_ibmi', which is standard for version retrieval. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious external calls are present. The code is straightforward and typical of Sphinx configuration files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
