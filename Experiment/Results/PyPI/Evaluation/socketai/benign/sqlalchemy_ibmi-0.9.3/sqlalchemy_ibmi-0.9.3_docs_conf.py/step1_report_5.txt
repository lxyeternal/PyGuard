  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, paths, extensions, and output options.",
  "sources": "import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..')); import sqlalchemy_ibmi",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and modifies sys.path, which is typical for documentation configuration and does not lead untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'autodoc_mock_imports' for 'sqlalchemy' suggests preparation for mocking during documentation build, not malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file. It modifies sys.path to include parent directory, sets project info, handles import of 'sqlalchemy_ibmi' with fallback, and configures documentation options. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. The code appears legitimate for its purpose, with no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses common patterns for documentation setup, and no anomalies or suspicious activities are present.",
