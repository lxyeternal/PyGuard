  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines a class 'Requirements' with property methods returning static support/unsupported statuses.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, data flow, or dynamic code execution. It is a straightforward configuration class.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Confirmed benign. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, static property methods indicating feature support.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Safe, benign configuration code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, feature flags via static properties.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, no dynamic behavior, straightforward configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Correct.\n- **Overall:** Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with some comments indicating incomplete or placeholder code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; the comments suggest it's boilerplate or template code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, configuration class for feature support.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, data flow, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports describe static configuration classes with no dynamic code, external data, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is purely declarative, setting feature support flags for testing.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident in any report.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (none of the code exhibits malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is consistent across reports, and all indicate benign configuration classes.\n- The high confidence in safety is justified given the static, read-only nature of the code.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the original assessments: this code is safe, non-malicious, and has no security implications.**",
