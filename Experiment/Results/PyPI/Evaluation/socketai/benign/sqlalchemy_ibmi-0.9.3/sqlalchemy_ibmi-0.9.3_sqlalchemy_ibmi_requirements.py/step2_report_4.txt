  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines a class 'Requirements' for SQLAlchemy tests, with property methods returning static exclusion states.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious behavior. The code is purely configuration.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Zero risk, zero malware.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign, with high confidence.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining feature support via properties.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data flow, no malicious activity, straightforward configuration.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Zero risk, zero malware.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, safe, and benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, feature flags for testing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code; just configuration.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Zero risk, zero malware.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with notes about incomplete 'TODO' comments and boilerplate code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The presence of 'TODO' comments suggests incomplete implementation, but no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Zero, benign.\n- **Assessment:** Valid, no security concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, feature support configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data processing, external input, or malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is straightforward configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0.\n- **Risk Scores:** Since the code is purely static configuration with no external dependencies or dynamic behavior, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe, benign, and purely for testing configuration.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, static configuration class for SQLAlchemy testing features, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
