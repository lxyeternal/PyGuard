  "purpose": "Defines a class 'Requirements' for SQLAlchemy tests, indicating support or lack thereof for various database features via static property methods.",
  "sources": "Class property methods returning fixed support/unsupported signals, no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration with no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Comments indicating incomplete or placeholder code, but no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for testing database features, with all properties returning static values indicating support or lack thereof. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious behavior is present. The code is static, declarative, and serves as a feature support indicator for testing purposes. No obfuscation or malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration for database feature support, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe and non-malicious.",
