  "purpose": "A test suite verifying that literals are not embedded in cached SQL statements in SQLAlchemy, across various data types.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test inputs within the test method, used as arguments to literal() and select().",
  "sinks": "The select() statements embedding literals, executed via connection.scalar().",
  "flows": "Test inputs flow into literal(), then into select(), then execute and compare results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded data, or dynamic execution; standard testing pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test for SQLAlchemy's literal handling, using static, hardcoded data across multiple data types. It conditionally imports select based on version, but no external inputs, credentials, or dynamic code execution are present. The test ensures literals are handled correctly without embedding in cached statements. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's purpose is benign, and the signals indicate a safe, standard testing scenario.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for SQLAlchemy's literal handling and caching behavior. No malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate, and the overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
