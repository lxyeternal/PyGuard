  "conclusion": "The code is benign test setup code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The risk score could be lowered to 0, considering the code's nature, but 0.1-0.2 is acceptable due to the use of 'import *' in a testing context. Overall, the code is safe and standard for testing environments."
