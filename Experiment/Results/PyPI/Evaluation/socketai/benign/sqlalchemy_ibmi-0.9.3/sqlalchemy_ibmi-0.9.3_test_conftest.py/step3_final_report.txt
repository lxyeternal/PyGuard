  "purpose": "Register custom SQLAlchemy dialects ('ibmi' and 'ibmi.pyodbc') and set up pytest assertion rewriting for testing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, registry.register calls, pytest.register_assert_rewrite, import * from sqlalchemy.testing.plugin.pytestplugin",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; setup functions are static",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from a testing plugin, which could be risky outside testing contexts but acceptable here",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for testing, involving dialect registration and pytest configuration. It contains no untrusted input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of 'import *' is typical in test environments but could be risky if misused outside testing. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk scores (around 0 or 0.2) reflect the benign, configuration nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward and well-understood pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign test setup code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The risk score could be lowered to 0, considering the code's nature, but 0.1-0.2 is acceptable due to the use of 'import *' in a testing context. Overall, the code is safe and standard for testing environments.",
