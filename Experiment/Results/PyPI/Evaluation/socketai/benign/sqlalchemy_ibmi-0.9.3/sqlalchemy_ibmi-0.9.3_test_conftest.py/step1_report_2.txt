  "purpose": "Setup for SQLAlchemy testing environment with custom dialect registration and pytest integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements, registry.register calls, pytest.register_assert_rewrite",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of standard library imports and function calls for setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules necessary for SQLAlchemy dialect registration and pytest integration, registers custom dialects for 'ibmi' and 'ibmi.pyodbc', and registers assertion rewrites for pytest. All operations are typical for setting up a testing environment. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for test setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard setup code for testing with SQLAlchemy and pytest, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
