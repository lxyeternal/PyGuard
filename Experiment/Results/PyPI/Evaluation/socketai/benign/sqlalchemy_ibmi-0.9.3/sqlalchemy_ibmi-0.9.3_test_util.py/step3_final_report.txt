{
  "purpose": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from SQLAlchemy and parses its major and minor version numbers into a list of integers.",
  "sources": "Access to the __version__ attribute from the sqlalchemy module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only processes a static string.",
  "flows": "Read __version__ -> split string -> convert first two segments to integers -> store in list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version parsing with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, standard operation of extracting version numbers from a version string. It imports __version__, splits it at periods, converts the first two parts into integers, and stores them in a list. There are no external inputs, data leaks, obfuscated code, or malicious actions. The logic is correct and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a straightforward version parsing task, and poses no security threat. The reports accurately reflect this, and no further action is necessary.",
