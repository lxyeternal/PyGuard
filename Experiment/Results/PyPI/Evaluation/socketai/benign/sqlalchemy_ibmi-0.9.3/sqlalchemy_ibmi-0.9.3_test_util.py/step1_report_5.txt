  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version number of the SQLAlchemy library and parses the major and minor version components into a list of integers.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'sqlalchemy.__version__'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leak or malicious actions identified",
  "flows": "Extracts version string -> Splits version string -> Converts parts to integers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from SQLAlchemy, which is a standard way to access library version info. It then splits the version string by '.' and converts the first two components into integers, storing them in a list. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, standard, and adheres to common practices for version parsing.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple version retrieval and parsing without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and standard.",
