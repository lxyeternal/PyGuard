{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version of the SQLAlchemy library and processes it into a list of integers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the sqlalchemy module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the sqlalchemy __version__ attribute to splitting and converting into integers.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from sqlalchemy to determine the installed version. It then splits the version string by periods and converts the first two segments into integers, storing them in a list. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard version parsing snippet, with no external inputs or complex logic involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply retrieves and processes the SQLAlchemy version without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a benign snippet likely used for compatibility or version-dependent logic.",
