  "purpose": "To extract and parse the version number of the SQLAlchemy library installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "The import statement that reads the __version__ attribute from the sqlalchemy module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or vulnerable points are present; the code only processes the version string.",
  "flows": "The source (__version__) is split into parts and converted into integers for further use, but no data is sent externally or used in unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward version parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from the sqlalchemy package and splits it into components. It then converts the major and minor version segments into integers. This is standard version parsing code, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or secret data handling. The process appears safe and typical for dependency version checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version extraction and parsing snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any harmful operations or data leaks. Overall, it appears benign and standard.",
