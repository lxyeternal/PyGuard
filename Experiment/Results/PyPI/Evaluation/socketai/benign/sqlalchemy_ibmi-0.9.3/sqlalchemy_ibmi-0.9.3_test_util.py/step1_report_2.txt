  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the SQLAlchemy library and parse the major and minor version numbers into a list of integers.",
  "sources": "Import statement fetching __version__ from sqlalchemy, which is a library version attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only processes static library data.",
  "flows": "Retrieving __version__, splitting the string, converting tokens to integers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version parsing with no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from the SQLAlchemy library, then splits this version string at periods to isolate the major and minor version components, converting them to integers and storing them in a list. This is a simple operation with no external input, no data manipulation beyond string splitting and list comprehension, and no unsafe or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a benign purpose of extracting SQLAlchemy version information. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no security risks detected.",
