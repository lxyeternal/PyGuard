  "purpose": "Retrieve and parse the version number of the SQLAlchemy library.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from sqlalchemy module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only processes version information.",
  "flows": "Extracts version string, splits it, converts parts to integers, and stores in a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version parsing with no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from sqlalchemy, then splits the version string at periods, takes the first two components, converts them to integers, and stores in a list. It is a standard way to parse library version numbers. There are no input or output sources that could be untrusted; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version parsing operation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
