{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'enum34' Python package, including dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via sys.version_info, reads package data files, and accesses module attributes such as __name__ and __main__.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a manner that could lead to data leaks or code execution. No network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading system info to determine dependencies and package selection, then passing this data to setup(). No untrusted data input or output flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code adheres to standard setup script practices; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks to conditionally set dependencies and package data. It constructs a package metadata dictionary and invokes setup() with it. All operations are typical for Python package setup files. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The use of sys and os modules is standard, and no untrusted inputs are processed. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. It only manages package metadata and dependencies. No security risks or malware are detected.",
