  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'enum34' Python package, providing metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, os, sys, setuptools, distutils.core.setup, package data declarations",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data influences execution, no network or data leakage points",
  "flows": "Data flows from package metadata into setup process; no untrusted data sources are processed or passed to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks with no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: defining dependencies based on Python version, configuring package data, and invoking setup(). No external inputs or dynamic execution that could be exploited. No suspicious code paths or behavior. No obfuscation, malicious commands, or malware patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
