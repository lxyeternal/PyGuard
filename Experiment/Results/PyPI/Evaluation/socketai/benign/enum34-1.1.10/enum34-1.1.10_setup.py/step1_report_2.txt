  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for the enum34 package. It conditionally adjusts dependencies based on Python version and defines package metadata, including description, author info, and classifiers. The code uses standard libraries and follows typical setup procedures without executing any untrusted data or including suspicious code. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no external data sources or sinks that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.",
