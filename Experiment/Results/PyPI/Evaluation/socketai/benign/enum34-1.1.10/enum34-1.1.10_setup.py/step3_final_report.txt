  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for the 'enum34' package, defining dependencies, metadata, and invoking setup().",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for environment checks, static package data, imports of standard modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Environment info (sys.version_info) influences dependencies; static data used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with environment-based dependency management. It imports standard modules, performs version checks, and calls setup() with static, well-defined data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate a benign package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
