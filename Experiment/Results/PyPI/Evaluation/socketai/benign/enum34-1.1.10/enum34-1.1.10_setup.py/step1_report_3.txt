  "purpose": "The script defines setup configuration for the 'enum34' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via sys.version_info; reads package data files; retrieves author info and package details.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "System info influences conditional logic for dependencies and packages; package data and metadata are loaded for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup configuration, with conditional dependencies based on Python version, and package metadata. No suspicious imports, network calls, or obfuscated code. It only reads system version info and loads static package data. No untrusted data inputs or malicious flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
