  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to be a generic Python script, potentially intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules. Specific sources are not detailed without the actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, file operations, or execution of dynamic code, but specific locations cannot be identified without code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks could involve user input, environment variables, or external data being processed and then sent over network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are apparent from the provided snippet. Lack of context limits detection.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The review would normally involve identifying source points, tracing data flow to sinks, and checking for suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, without the actual code, this assessment remains tentative. No malware indicators detected.",
