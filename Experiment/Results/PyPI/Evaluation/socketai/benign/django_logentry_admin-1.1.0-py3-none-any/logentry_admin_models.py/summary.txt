  "conclusion": "Report 1's high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.85) scores are justified given the described suspicious features. Other reports are benign or lack evidence, warranting low scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, with minor adjustments in confidence for reports with no code. The assessment accurately reflects the potential threat level based on available information."
