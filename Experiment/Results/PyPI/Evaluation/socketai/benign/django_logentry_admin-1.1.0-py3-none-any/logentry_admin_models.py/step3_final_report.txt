  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution functions (eval/exec), network activity, hardcoded IPs/URLs, environment variables, data handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks via code execution, network transmission, or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials/IPs, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, suspicious network activity, unusual data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code with suspicious patterns such as eval/exec, hardcoded malicious URLs/IPs, obfuscation, and network activity indicates potential malicious intent. Absence of code or benign patterns correspond to low risk. The scores assigned reflect the presence or absence of these indicators, with high scores justified in Report 1 due to multiple suspicious features. Reports lacking code or showing benign patterns have appropriately low scores. Confidence levels align with the clarity of evidence; higher confidence in suspicious code leads to higher malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1's high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.85) scores are justified given the described suspicious features. Other reports are benign or lack evidence, warranting low scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, with minor adjustments in confidence for reports with no code. The assessment accurately reflects the potential threat level based on available information.",
