  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a placeholder or a blank script with no functional implementation. It may be a template or an incomplete module.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input, data, or external sources; it contains no I/O operations or data fetching.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists due to lack of any operational code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely empty with no logic, variables, or functions. This is unusual for a typical module or script, indicating either incomplete code or an intentional placeholder. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains no executable statements, data handling, or external interactions. It appears as an empty script or placeholder. Without any logic, data flow, or external calls, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The absence of code suggests it is either intentionally blank or incomplete, with no malicious intent detectable at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is empty and contains no operational logic, data handling, or external interactions. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior based on the current content.",
