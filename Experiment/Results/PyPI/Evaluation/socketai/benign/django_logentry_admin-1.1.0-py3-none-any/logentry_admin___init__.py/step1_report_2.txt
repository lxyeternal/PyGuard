  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads data from local variables, possibly files or input functions if present, but no external data sources are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, or network connections if present, but none are explicitly observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks is evident based on the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious API calls, are detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code indicates standard Python functions without suspicious patterns. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are visible. The code appears to serve a benign purpose, possibly related to utility functions or data processing, with no anomalous behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a typical, benign Python script. No security risks or malware are detected based on the provided snippet.",
