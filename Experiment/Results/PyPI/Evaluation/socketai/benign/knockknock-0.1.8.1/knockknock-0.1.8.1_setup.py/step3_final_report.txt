  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'knockknock' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; package metadata; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'; entry point 'knockknock' from '__main__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads long description from file; dependencies are installed; entry point executed during package run.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; dependencies are common libraries; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with standard structure. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. Dependencies are typical for email and messaging functionalities but do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code, network activity, or secrets are embedded. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are consistent and accurate. No further action is necessary.",
