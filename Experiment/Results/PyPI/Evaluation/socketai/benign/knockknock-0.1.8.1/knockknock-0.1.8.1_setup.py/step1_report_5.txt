  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'knockknock' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static package metadata, list of dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into critical functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content into 'long_description' and defining package installation details; no data flow to external untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. Usage of common setup patterns and dependencies. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads the long description from a Markdown file, specifies package info, dependencies, and entry points. Dependencies include email, key management, messaging, and communication libraries, but none indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or suspicious code segments are present. The code follows common practices for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
