  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'knockknock' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations identified.",
  "flows": "Input reading from 'README.md' during package setup; dependency installation from specified package list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected. The code strictly performs package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup functions, reads a README file for description, and specifies dependencies, metadata, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no sensitive data handling are present. The dependencies include common libraries, with no indications of malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard setup.py script for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks identified. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
