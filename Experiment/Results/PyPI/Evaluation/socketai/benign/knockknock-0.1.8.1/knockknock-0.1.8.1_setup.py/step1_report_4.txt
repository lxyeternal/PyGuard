{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'knockknock' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, package discovery via find_packages(), and list of dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package metadata and dependencies to installation setup; no untrusted input flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a local README file, specifies package requirements, and sets up a console script entry point. All code uses standard library functions and well-known patterns. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. Dependencies listed are common for such projects and do not show signs of malicious intent. The setup process is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
