  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and installation parameters for the 'knockknock' Python project, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md'; reads project metadata; specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or execute code dynamically; no network or data leak points directly evident in this script.",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flow; primarily static configuration setup with dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present; dependencies are standard libraries. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading a README file, defining package metadata, specifying dependencies, and setting up entry points. All elements are typical and do not exhibit signs of malicious intent or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious or suspicious elements. It follows standard packaging practices without exposing security vulnerabilities.",
