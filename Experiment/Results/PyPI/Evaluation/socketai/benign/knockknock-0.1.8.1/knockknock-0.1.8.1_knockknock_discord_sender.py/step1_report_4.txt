  "purpose": "Wrapper for sending Discord notifications before and after executing a function, primarily for monitoring training processes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('RANK'), hostname via socket.gethostname(), current datetime, and function arguments/return value.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST requests to a provided webhook URL, potentially exposing data if the webhook URL is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Reads 'RANK' environment variable and hostname, constructs message payload, and sends data via requests.post(). The main data flow involves posting status messages to Discord webhook URL before and after function execution, including error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. Use of requests.post() could be abused if the webhook URL is malicious or untrusted, but this is a legitimate feature for notifications.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements a decorator for monitoring and notifying via Discord webhooks about the start, completion, or failure of a function. It uses environment variables, socket for hostname, and datetime for timestamps. The requests library is used to send notifications. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. The webhook URL is user-provided, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is a normal pattern for alerting systems. No suspicious data leaks or malicious behavior detected. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate notification wrapper for training processes with no malicious intent. It could pose a risk if the webhook URL is compromised, but the code itself is safe and standard in its behavior.",
