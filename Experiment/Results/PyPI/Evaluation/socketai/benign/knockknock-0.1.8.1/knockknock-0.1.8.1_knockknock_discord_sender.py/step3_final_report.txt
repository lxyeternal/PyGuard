{
  "purpose": "A decorator that sends start, success, or crash notifications to a Discord webhook during function execution, primarily for monitoring training processes.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'RANK', hostname, function arguments, function return value, traceback info.",
  "sinks": "POST requests to the provided webhook URL via requests library.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables, hostname, function args/return -> sink: requests.post to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward notification decorator that reports training status to a Discord webhook. It reads environment variables and system info, then sends messages before and after function execution, including error reports. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; it relies on user-provided webhook URL. The only external activity is POST requests, which are standard for such notifications. No obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The code's logic is clear, and the implementation is correct. The potential risk is the misuse of the webhook URL, but this is inherent to any webhook-based notification system and not a flaw in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard monitoring decorator with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions as intended for training process notifications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
