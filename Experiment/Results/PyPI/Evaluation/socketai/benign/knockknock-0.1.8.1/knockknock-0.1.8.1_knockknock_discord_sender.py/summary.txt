  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard monitoring decorator with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions as intended for training process notifications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
