  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent notification utility for training process monitoring. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The potential privacy concern due to detailed logs is acknowledged but does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) reflecting privacy considerations."
