  "purpose": "Import statements for various notification sender modules in the 'knockknock' package, likely used for sending alerts via multiple communication platforms.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load specific sender functions or classes from the 'knockknock' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; only imports are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution logic; only module imports, so no source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are present. The code appears to be standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various sender modules within the 'knockknock' package. There are no executable statements, data processing, or network interactions shown. The modules imported are for different communication platforms, suggesting the package supports multi-channel notifications. Since only imports are present, there are no immediate security concerns, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign and purely consists of module import statements for notification senders. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
