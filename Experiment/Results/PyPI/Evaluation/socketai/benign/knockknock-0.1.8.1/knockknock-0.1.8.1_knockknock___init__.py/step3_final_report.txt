  "purpose": "Import statements for various notification sender modules from the 'knockknock' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'knockknock' modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or network activity present",
  "flows": "None; only static imports without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the 'knockknock' package, importing various notification platform modules. There is no executable logic, data processing, or network activity visible. The code appears benign, with high confidence in this assessment. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score is 0.1, acknowledging minimal inherent risk due to external package trustworthiness, but no direct threat is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for notification modules. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified. The primary security consideration should be verifying the trustworthiness of the 'knockknock' package itself, outside the scope of this snippet.",
