{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to send email notifications about the start, success, or failure of a specified function, primarily used for tracking training processes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), socket.gethostname(), function arguments, and the function's return value.",
  "sinks": "Uses yagmail.SMTP to send emails, which could potentially be exploited if credentials or recipient addresses are maliciously supplied or if email content is manipulated.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and hostname are read at the start; email content is generated based on function execution; emails are sent at start, success, or crash events, including exception details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external domain connections, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling detected. Use of traceback and exception info is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that manages email notifications for function execution. It initializes SMTP with a sender email, which could be malicious if credentials are compromised, but in this context, no credentials are hardcoded or maliciously embedded. The code reads environment variables and hostname info securely and uses these to compose email content. It handles exceptions and sends crash reports. No signs of backdoors, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration are evident. Usage of environment variables and email sending is typical for monitoring workflows. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate email notification decorator intended for process monitoring. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks beyond standard email handling. No malware or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
