{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to send email notifications before, after, or upon failure of a wrapped function, specifically for training processes, with distributed training support.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('RANK'), retrieves hostname, calls the decorated function, and formats email content.",
  "sinks": "Uses yagmail.SMTP to send emails; email content includes runtime info and exceptions.",
  "flows": "Environmental variable 'RANK' influences process role; start time, hostname, and function result are gathered and sent via email; exceptions trigger crash email notifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code relies on external email configuration via yagmail.SMTP. No malicious code or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script facilitates email notifications related to training processes, with support for distributed setups. It dynamically determines the process role via environment variables. No suspicious or malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. It uses standard libraries and a third-party email library for notifications. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs legitimate monitoring and notification functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate utility for email notifications during training workflows, with no malicious intent or security risks observed.",
