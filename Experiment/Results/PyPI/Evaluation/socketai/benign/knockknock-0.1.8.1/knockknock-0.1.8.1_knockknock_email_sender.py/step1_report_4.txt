{
  "purpose": "A decorator for sending email notifications about the start, success, or failure of a function execution, specifically for training processes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: recipient_emails, sender_email; Environment variable: RANK; Function arguments and return values.",
  "sinks": "Yagmail SMTP send method that sends emails with notification contents.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables feed into email setup and control flow; Function execution results and exceptions determine email notifications sent via yagmail.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; use of environment variable RANK for distributed training detection is appropriate; email content is straightforward, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an email notification wrapper using yagmail to alert users about training process states. It correctly detects distributed training scenarios via environment variables, avoiding duplicate notifications from worker processes. Email contents are generated dynamically based on function execution status, with exception handling capturing traceback info. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's logic is clear, with standard practices for email notifications and environment detection, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for notification purposes in training workflows. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It adheres to standard security practices with no hardcoded secrets or unsafe behaviors.",
