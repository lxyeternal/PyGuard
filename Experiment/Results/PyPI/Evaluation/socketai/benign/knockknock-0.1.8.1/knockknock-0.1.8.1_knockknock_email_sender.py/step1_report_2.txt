{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator for sending email notifications before, after, and upon exceptions during the execution of a specified function, primarily for monitoring training processes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('RANK'), system hostname (socket.gethostname()), function arguments, and the return value of the decorated function.",
  "sinks": "Uses yagmail.SMTP to send emails to specified recipient addresses; the email content includes system info, function output, and exception details.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables, hostname, function arguments, and return value; flows lead to email content creation and sending via yagmail.SMTP.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hidden behaviors are apparent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns. Usage of environment variables and email sending is straightforward. No obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an email notification decorator for monitoring function execution, especially training routines. It reads environment variables for distributed training context and system hostname for logging. Email credentials are managed via the yagmail.SMTP object, which expects proper configuration outside this code. There are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code performs standard logging and email notifications. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present. The use of email and environment variables appears legitimate and intended for process monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for email notifications related to training process monitoring. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. It functions as a benign monitoring utility with no security risks evident.",
