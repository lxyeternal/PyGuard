  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard monitoring decorator with no malicious intent. It transmits system and function info via Telegram, which could pose a minor security risk if tokens are compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal but present data leakage potential."
