{
  "purpose": "A decorator that sends Telegram notifications before, after, and on failure of a function, mainly for training process monitoring.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'RANK', hostname, function arguments, return values, exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Telegram Bot API using provided token and chat_id.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and system info, sends messages before execution, after success, or on exception, including function output and timing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Sends potentially sensitive info over external API.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward monitoring decorator utilizing standard libraries and the Telegram API. It reads environment variables and system info, and reports execution status. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. It transmits runtime info, which could leak sensitive data if tokens or messages are mishandled, but this is typical for monitoring tools. Exception handling is proper, and the code's purpose is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard monitoring decorator with no malicious intent. It transmits system and function info via Telegram, which could pose a minor security risk if tokens are compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal but present data leakage potential.",
