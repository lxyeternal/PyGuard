{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator for sending Telegram notifications before, after, and upon failure of a function, primarily for monitoring training processes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), retrieves hostname (socket.gethostname()), and calls external API via telegram.Bot.",
  "sinks": "Calls telegram.Bot.send_message, which sends data over the network to Telegram servers.",
  "flows": "Source: Environment variables and hostname -> Sinks: Telegram API via bot.send_message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or API tokens; tokens are passed as function arguments. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no backdoors or hidden behaviors. Exception handling is straightforward and related to monitoring; no data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the telegram library. It defines a decorator that wraps a function, sending start, success, or failure messages via Telegram. It uses environment variables to detect distributed training setups and conditionally sends messages only from the master process. The API token and chat ID are passed as arguments, not hardcoded, reducing risk. All data transmitted is to Telegram servers for notification purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears solely for monitoring and notification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a monitoring decorator that sends status updates via Telegram. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No security risks are identified beyond the usual need to secure Telegram tokens, which are passed as arguments. Overall, the code appears safe and purposeful without malicious intent.",
