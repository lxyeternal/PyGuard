{
  "purpose": "This code implements a decorator that sends desktop notifications at the start, end, or crash of a function, primarily for monitoring training or long-running processes across different operating systems.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('RANK'), system hostname, timestamps, and function return values.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run() to invoke system notification commands; optionally imports win10toast for Windows notifications.",
  "flows": "Decorator wraps the target function, sending notifications before execution, after completion, or upon exception, including system info and timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; subprocess calls are controlled and use static commands.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for user notifications during process execution. It handles environment variables, system info, and exceptions properly. Subprocess calls are OS-specific and involve static commands, minimizing risk. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or network activity are present. The code's structure and inputs are safe, and error handling is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for process monitoring via desktop notifications. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The scores are consistent with its behavior.",
