  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the claims, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Accurate. The code defines a decorator for DingTalk notifications, reading environment variables, parameters, and function results.\n- **Sinks**: Correct. Uses requests.post, constructs encrypted URLs with HMAC and Base64.\n- **Flow**: Correctly described. Data flows from environment, parameters, function execution, to network requests.\n- **Anomalies**: None detected. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: The assessment that the code is benign, standard, and secure is accurate.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly more detailed analysis. No malicious behavior, standard cryptography, and network communication.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues, consistent scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- The JSON parse error indicates a problem with parsing the report, not the code itself.\n- The detailed raw_response confirms the code's behavior is benign, with standard URL signing, notifications, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The scoring aligns with the code's benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous reports; describes a standard notification decorator with URL signing and environment detection.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Again, consistent with previous reports: a notification decorator with environment detection, URL signing, and network requests.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?** No. All reports confirm the code is a standard notification wrapper for DingTalk.\n- **Obfuscation?** No. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware score?** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Risk scores?** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security risk due to network communication, which is typical for such monitoring tools.\n\n### My Final Estimation\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, due to network activity and potential data exposure in logs/messages, but nothing malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign implementation of a notification decorator for training workflows, with no malicious intent or behavior. The scoring reflects this appropriately.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.1-0.2** (acceptable, minimal)\n\nThis code can be considered safe, with typical security considerations for network communication and logging.",
