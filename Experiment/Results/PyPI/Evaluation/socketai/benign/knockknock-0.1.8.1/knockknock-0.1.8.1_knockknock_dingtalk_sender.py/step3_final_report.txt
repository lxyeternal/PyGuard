{
  "purpose": "A decorator for sending DingTalk notifications at the start, success, or crash of a function, including optional URL encryption and environment-aware execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('RANK'), function parameters, function return value, system hostname, current timestamp.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to DingTalk webhook URLs, with optional URL signing using HMAC and Base64.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and parameters feed into message content; message content is sent via requests.post to DingTalk URLs, with URL signing if secret is provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; standard cryptographic practices; no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard notification decorator that logs training process states. It uses environment variables to detect distributed training rank, constructs messages with timestamps and function info, signs URLs securely when secrets are used, and sends notifications via requests.post. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present; the cryptography and network communication are typical for such monitoring tools. The code is clear, well-structured, and employs best practices for URL signing and environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a training notification utility. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The network activity is expected for such a monitoring tool, and no security flaws are evident.",
