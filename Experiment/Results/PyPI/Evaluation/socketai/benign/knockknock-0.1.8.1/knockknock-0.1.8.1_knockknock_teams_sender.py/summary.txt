  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured notification utility for monitoring training or long-running tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
