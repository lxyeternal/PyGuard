{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator for sending notifications to a Microsoft Teams webhook during the execution of a function, indicating start, success, or failure states, particularly in training or similar processes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'RANK', hostname via socket.gethostname(), function arguments, and external webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Sends JSON payloads via HTTP POST requests to the specified webhook URL using requests.post().",
  "flows": "When decorated, the code sends a start message, executes the function, then sends either a success or crash message based on the outcome, including timing and return values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors detected. Use of requests library appears legitimate for notification purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for environment access, networking, and date/time management. It carefully handles exceptions to notify failures. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. It functions solely as a notification wrapper around arbitrary functions, primarily for monitoring training processes. The only external interaction is via HTTPS requests to a provided webhook URL, which is typical for notification systems.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate notification utility intended for monitoring purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
