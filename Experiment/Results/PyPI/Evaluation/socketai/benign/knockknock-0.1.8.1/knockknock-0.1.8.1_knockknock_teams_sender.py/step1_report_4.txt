{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator to send notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel via webhook during the execution of a function, reporting start, success, or crash details.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('RANK') for distributed process detection, and accepts 'webhook_url' and 'user_mentions' as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.post' function sends JSON data to the provided webhook URL; the URL itself is an input parameter, but not used insecurely within the code.",
  "flows": "Input data (webhook URL, environment variables, function parameters) flows into notification contents which are sent via HTTP POST requests at different stages of function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present. The code uses environment variables for process detection; no suspicious or hidden code segments or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a decorator that reports execution status to a Teams channel. It gathers environment info, timestamps, and function output. It handles exceptions and reports crashes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are evident. Usage of 'requests' for notifications is standard. No signs of code injection, data theft, or malicious network activity. Overall, the code appears safe, purpose is purely for notification.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a notification wrapper for training or long-running processes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It handles environment detection, timing, and reporting securely without exposing secrets or executing malicious actions.",
