{
  "purpose": "A decorator function to send notifications to a Microsoft Teams webhook during the execution of a wrapped function, indicating start, success, or crash states.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('RANK'), system hostname, and function arguments; takes webhook URL as input parameter.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to webhook URL via requests.post, potentially exposing sensitive information in logs or network if misused.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'RANK' -> determines process role; function execution -> success or exception -> sends appropriate notification with details.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'requests' to post data, but the data contains potentially sensitive information like exceptions and environment details. No hardcoded secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that wraps a function to send start, success, or crash notifications to a Teams webhook. It reads the system hostname and environment variables, constructs message payloads, and posts them. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious logic. It merely reports process states and exceptions. Usage of 'requests' to send data is standard, but it could potentially leak sensitive info if used improperly, which is a design consideration rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are evident. Overall, the code appears legitimate, intended for operational notifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a notification decorator with no malicious intent. It responsibly reports process states and errors via webhook. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
