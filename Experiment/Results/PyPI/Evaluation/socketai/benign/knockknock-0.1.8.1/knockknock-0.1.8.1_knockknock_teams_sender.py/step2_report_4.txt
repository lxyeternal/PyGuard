  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe a decorator that sends start, success, and crash notifications via HTTP POST requests to a Microsoft Teams webhook.\n- The code reads environment variables ('RANK'), hostname, and function arguments.\n- Uses the requests library for network communication.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code behaviors are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be operational monitoring, primarily for training or long-running processes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** No. The code is straightforward, with no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden malicious logic.\n- **Code correctness:** No obvious bugs or errors. It handles exceptions and reports appropriately.\n- **Potential security concerns:** The only possible concern is that it posts potentially sensitive info (exceptions, environment info) to external webhooks, but this is standard for monitoring tools and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- **No major flaws detected.** The code is clean and well-structured.\n- **Potential security note:** The code could leak sensitive info if used improperly (e.g., webhook URL or environment details), but this is a usage consideration, not a flaw in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and justification:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The code performs no malicious actions; it only sends notifications.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score remains **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score remains **0**.\n\n#### Security risk score:\n- The reports assign low scores (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk.\n- The only concern is potential data leakage via network requests, but this is typical for such notification systems.\n- **Justification for a score > 0.5?** No. The code is benign, and the risk is low.\n- **Conclusion:** Keep at **0.1-0.2** as per reports.\n\n#### Overall risk assessment:\n- The code is a monitoring utility with no malicious intent.\n- No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.\n- The only potential concern is data leakage, which is inherent in notification systems but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (consistent with reports)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The reports are accurate; no modifications needed.\n- The code is legitimate, well-structured, and safe for operational use.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code's behavior is transparent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard notification decorator for training monitoring.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
