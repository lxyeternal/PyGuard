{
  "purpose": "A decorator that sends start, success, and crash notifications to a Microsoft Teams webhook during function execution, primarily for training or long-running process monitoring.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'RANK', socket.gethostname(), function arguments, exception details, function return value.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending JSON payloads to the webhook URL, potentially exposing environment info or error details if misused.",
  "flows": "Source data (environment variables, hostname, function args) flows into notification content, which is sent via requests.post() to the webhook, especially during start, success, or exception events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for notification purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard notification decorator that reports training process status to a webhook. It reads environment variables and system info, handles exceptions, and posts JSON payloads. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The only potential concern is data leakage if webhook URLs or mentions contain sensitive info, but this is typical for such utilities. The code uses common libraries and patterns, with no dynamic code execution or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured notification utility for monitoring training or long-running tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
