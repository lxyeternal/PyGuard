{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator function for sending status notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel via a webhook, primarily for monitoring training or long-running processes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (RANK), hostname via socket.gethostname(), and function arguments. Sends HTTP POST requests using the requests library.",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.post to send JSON data to the specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'RANK' influences logic; function execution flow involves sending start, success, or crash notifications through HTTP POST requests with formatted JSON payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. Uses environment variables and hostname data responsibly. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution. The code only performs notification tasks with standard libraries and requests, which are common for such purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a decorator that wraps a function to send notifications to a Microsoft Teams webhook at start, on success, and on exception. It reads the environment variable 'RANK' to determine if it should send notifications, which is common in distributed training setups. The use of requests.post with JSON payloads is straightforward and intended for communication with a notification service. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No suspicious data leaks or covert activities. The code is structured and clear, serving a monitoring purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign notification utility for training or process monitoring. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It relies on standard libraries and typical notification patterns, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
