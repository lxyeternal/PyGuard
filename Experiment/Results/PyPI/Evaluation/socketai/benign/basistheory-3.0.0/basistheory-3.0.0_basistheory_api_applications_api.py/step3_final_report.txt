{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated Python client SDK for the Basis Theory API, providing methods to manage applications through standard HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as IDs, request objects, and optional parameters for API calls.",
  "sinks": "External API endpoints via HTTP requests; no data is written to external sinks within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., IDs, request objects) flow into API call methods which construct and send HTTP requests; responses are returned as model objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present. Validation regex for UUIDs is standard. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a boilerplate, auto-generated SDK wrapper for the Basis Theory API, handling CRUD operations on applications. It uses standard validation, parameter handling, and HTTP request patterns. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are evident. The API key is expected to be supplied externally, not embedded. The regex for UUID validation is correct. The code's structure and behavior are typical for such SDKs, with no suspicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API client library with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard SDK wrapper. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
