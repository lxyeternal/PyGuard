{
  "purpose": "The code is an auto-generated API client SDK for Basis Theory, handling request construction, serialization, deserialization, and authentication in a standard manner.",
  "sources": "Configuration data, environment info, user input parameters, file streams for uploads.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, response deserialization, file handling, environment data in user-agent headers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and serialized, used in network requests, responses are deserialized into objects, files are read and closed after use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical patterns for an SDK generated via OpenAPI, with proper resource management, no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. Serialization and deserialization are transparent, and authentication handling is standard. No suspicious data flows or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, secure, auto-generated SDK with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
