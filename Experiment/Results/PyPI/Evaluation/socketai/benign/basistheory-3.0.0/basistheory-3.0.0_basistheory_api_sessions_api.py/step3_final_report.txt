{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated API client for session management with Basis Theory, facilitating authorization and session creation via HTTP POST requests.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'authorize_session_request' and 'request_options' which provide input data for API calls.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request functions that send data to external API endpoints; no data leaks or untrusted data handling within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API request payloads, which are then transmitted over the network to specified endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports ('re', 'sys') are present but benign; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API client with well-structured endpoint definitions. It performs network requests to predefined URLs with provided parameters. No malicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation is present. The unused imports are typical artifacts of code generation. The data flow is straightforward, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious behavior. The security posture is minimal risk, primarily due to boilerplate structure and unused imports, which do not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
