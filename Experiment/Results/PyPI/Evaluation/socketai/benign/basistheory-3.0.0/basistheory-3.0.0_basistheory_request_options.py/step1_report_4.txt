{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for request options, encapsulating API key, correlation ID, and idempotency key parameters for API requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the constructor (__init__), possibly external sources when creating an instance (e.g., API key from environment or user input).",
  "sinks": "Assigning input parameters to instance variables; no direct sinks for untrusted data in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from constructor arguments to object attributes; no data flow beyond assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, defines a class with an initializer that assigns parameters to instance variables. No external data processing, no security-sensitive operations, and no suspicious code patterns. The class appears to serve as a simple data container for request configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious data handling in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward class definition for request options, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It is a standard pattern for managing API request parameters.",
