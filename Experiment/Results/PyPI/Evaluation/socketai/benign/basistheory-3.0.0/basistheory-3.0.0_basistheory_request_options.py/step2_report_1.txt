  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `basistheory.api` but does not use it.\n- Defines `RequestOptions` class with optional parameters: `api_key`, `correlation_id`, `idempotency_key`.\n- No data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations.\n- The code appears to be a simple data container.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches all reports; no anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The import of `basistheory.api` is unused, but this alone is not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- None observed; the class is straightforward and serves as a data holder.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.1 or 0, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **securityRisk** score of 0.1 might be slightly high if considering the import unused; however, this is minor.\n- The **confidence** scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), reflecting the benign assessment.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to unused import but no real risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious activity detected                                |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns                     |\n| Risk            | 0.1                 | Minor due to unused import; overall benign                     |\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent with the code.\n- No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n- The code is a benign data container with no security issues.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current assessments.**",
