  "purpose": "Defines a simple data container class for request options with optional parameters.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class only assigns parameters to instance variables without processing or transmitting data.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'basistheory.api' but no malicious or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition that initializes optional request parameters. It contains no network activity, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The import is unused but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data holder with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate; the scores are appropriate. The only minor adjustment is lowering the risk score in report 2 from 1.0 to approximately 0.1 to better reflect the benign nature.",
