{
  "purpose": "Define a class for encapsulating request options such as API key, correlation ID, and idempotency key.",
  "sources": "The code reads potential input from the constructor parameters (api_key, correlation_id, idempotency_key).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network or file operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The class stores input parameters as instance variables but does not process or transmit data further.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or suspicious code structures; no unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class definition with an initializer that assigns input parameters to object attributes. It imports a module 'basistheory.api' but does not use it within the snippet. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activities are evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for such a data container class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The import statement is unused in this fragment, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class definition for request options, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal use.",
