  "purpose": "Defines a RequestOptions class for managing API request metadata such as API key, correlation ID, and idempotency key.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters (__init__) for API key, correlation ID, and idempotency key.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or insecure processing identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (api_key, correlation_id, idempotency_key) flow into class attributes without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, defines a simple class with an initializer that assigns provided parameters to instance variables. It appears to be a straightforward data holder with no evidence of malicious or unusual behavior. No data leakage, insecure handling, or malicious patterns are evident. Usage of external module 'basistheory.api' is not suspicious by itself. The class does not process or transmit data beyond storing parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class for storing request options with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
