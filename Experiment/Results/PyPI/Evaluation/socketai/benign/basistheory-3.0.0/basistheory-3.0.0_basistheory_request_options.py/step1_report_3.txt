{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for holding request options, including optional API key, correlation ID, and idempotency key.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method: api_key, correlation_id, idempotency_key",
  "sinks": "Assignment operations to self.api_key, self.correlation_id, self.idempotency_key",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are assigned directly to instance variables (sinks)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious function calls, no obfuscated code, and no external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class with an initializer that assigns provided parameters to instance variables. It imports a module 'basistheory.api' but does not invoke any functions or methods from it. No processing, validation, or network activity is present. The class appears to serve as a configuration holder for requests, with optional parameters that could be supplied externally. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected in structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard data class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any active behavior, network calls, or suspicious operations.",
