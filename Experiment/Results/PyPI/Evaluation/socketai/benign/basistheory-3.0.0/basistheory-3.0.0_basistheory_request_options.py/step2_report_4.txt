  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a class `RequestOptions` with an `__init__` method that assigns optional parameters (`api_key`, `correlation_id`, `idempotency_key`) to instance variables.\n- The code imports `basistheory.api` but does not use it within this snippet.\n- No data processing, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports consistently identify that the code is a straightforward data container with no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. They are accurate; the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n- **Potential security flaws?**  \n  No. No hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, no suspicious code patterns.\n- **Unused import?**  \n  The import of `basistheory.api` is unused, which could be flagged as a minor inefficiency or code smell, but not a security issue.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the benign nature, a score of 0.1 or 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaw, a risk score higher than 0.2 would be unwarranted.\n- The import being unused is not a security concern but could be noted as a minor code quality issue.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they are cautious and accurate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate low or no risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity observed.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, considering the unused import but no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no security risks. The scores are appropriate; I would not suggest any significant changes.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
