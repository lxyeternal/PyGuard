{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for request options, including optional API key and identifiers",
  "sources": "None explicitly; potential input could be provided externally via class instantiation parameters",
  "kills": "None present; no direct untrusted data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the class with user-provided parameters (api_key, correlation_id, idempotency_key)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward data container class with optional attributes",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library 'basistheory' but does not utilize it within this snippet. It defines a simple class 'RequestOptions' with an initializer that assigns optional parameters. No data processing, external inputs, or network calls are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is evident. The class appears to be a part of a larger application where these options might be used for API requests. There is no malicious behavior, backdoor, or malware observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign class definition serving as a data container for request parameters. It does not contain any malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content.",
