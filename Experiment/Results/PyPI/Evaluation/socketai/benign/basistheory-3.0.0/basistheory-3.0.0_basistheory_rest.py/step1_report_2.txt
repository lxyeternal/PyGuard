{
  "purpose": "This code implements an HTTP client wrapper using urllib3 for communicating with the Basis Theory API, including request handling, SSL configuration, and proxy bypass logic.",
  "sources": "User-provided API URLs, request parameters (headers, query params, body, post params), environment variables for proxies and SSL configurations.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution via urllib3 request method, handling of request headers, body serialization (JSON, form data, multipart), response status handling, and exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (URL, headers, body, query params) flow into request method; headers and body are processed and serialized; urllib3 performs network request; response data or exceptions flow back for handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs standard HTTP client operations. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no hidden backdoors. Proxy bypass logic appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical HTTP client implementation using urllib3, with structured request methods and response handling. It incorporates SSL verification, proxy management, and error handling consistent with standard practices. No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or covert backdoors are present. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious functions, and all operations are related to standard network communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an API HTTP client, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles request construction, SSL, proxies, and error conditions responsibly, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
