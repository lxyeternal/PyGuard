{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python HTTP client for interacting with the Basis Theory API, managing SSL, proxies, connection pooling, and request handling.",
  "sources": "Input data from request parameters, environment variables for proxies, SSL configurations, and response data.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the API endpoint, response data returned to the caller.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request parameters and environment variables into network requests; responses flow back from the server to the caller.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Proxy bypass logic and SSL configurations are standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client utilizing urllib3, with proper SSL and proxy management, request serialization, and error handling. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident. The proxy bypass and SSL configurations follow best practices. The request flow handles untrusted input in a typical manner for such clients. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting inherent risks in handling untrusted data but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low risk scores are appropriate, and the analysis confirms the code's benign nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
