  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API errors and exceptions related to OpenAPI interactions in a Python client.",
  "sources": "User input is indirectly processed through exception handling, primarily in error message formatting and path rendering.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages that include formatted paths and error details; no direct sinks for untrusted input with potential security impact.",
  "flows": "Error details and paths are formatted into strings for exceptions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks with security implications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code mainly provides exception classes and formatting functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling various API errors, including type, value, attribute, key, and general API exceptions. It includes a utility function 'render_path' for converting a list-based path into a string format for error messages. The implementation focuses on error handling and message formatting. No user input or untrusted data is directly processed or evaluated; all data used in exception messages are derived from internal error contexts. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors, are present. The code is structurally sound, with no obfuscated elements or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes for API error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities. Overall, the code appears safe, with a low malware score.",
