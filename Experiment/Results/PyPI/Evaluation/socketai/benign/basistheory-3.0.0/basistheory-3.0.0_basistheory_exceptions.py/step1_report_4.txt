  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to OpenAPI interactions, including type, value, attribute, key, and general API exceptions.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines classes and functions but does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no points where untrusted data influences system behavior or outputs.",
  "flows": "None; the code consists solely of class definitions and a utility function for rendering paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The comments and structure are standard for API error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of exception classes for API error handling, including detailed error messages and path rendering for debugging. The 'render_path' function constructs string representations of error paths. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls, and no code execution based on external data. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or obfuscation. No security risks are identified in this module.",
