  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of exception class definitions and a utility function for rendering paths.\n   - No report indicates any malicious code, data processing, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the purpose and functionality of the code.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct given the straightforward, readable code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting the clear understanding of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are 0, which is justified.\n   - Since the code is purely exception handling with no data processing or external interactions, high risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code does not contain malicious behavior.\n   - The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on speculation.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes and a utility function for error message formatting.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks.\n- The reports are thorough, accurate, and appropriately cautious.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThis code serves as a foundational exception handling module for an API client. It does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to security issues, nor does it contain any malicious or suspicious patterns. The high confidence and low scores are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, safe, and purely for structured error handling. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
