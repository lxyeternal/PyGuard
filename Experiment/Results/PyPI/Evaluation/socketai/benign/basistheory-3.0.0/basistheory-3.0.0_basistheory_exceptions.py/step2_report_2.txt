  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the validity of their scores, and whether any concerns are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes for API error handling, with no processing of untrusted data or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is purely for exception handling and message formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes exception classes for handling HTTP errors, with detailed error message formatting.\n- **Assessment:** The evaluation is accurate. The code handles error data and formats messages but does not process untrusted input or perform malicious actions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard exception classes with path rendering, no external data processing or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, with no signs of security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe code.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes, no external data reading or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely for structured error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, exception classes with no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard error handling code.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a set of exception classes and a utility function for rendering error paths.\n- **Security Implication:** No processing of untrusted data, no network operations, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for API error handling, with no signs of security issues or malicious intent.",
