  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for API error handling and a utility function to render error paths.",
  "sources": "Error message formatting functions and class initializers that use internal data; no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings constructed from internal variables; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Error data flows from exception attributes into formatted messages; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and solely for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes and a helper function for rendering error paths. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The error message formatting relies solely on internal variables, and no external data sources are involved. The code's purpose is purely for structured error reporting, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of API exception classes and a path rendering utility. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
