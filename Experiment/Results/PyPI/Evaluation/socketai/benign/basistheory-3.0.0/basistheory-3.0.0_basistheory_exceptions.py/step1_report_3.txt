  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API errors in an OpenAPI client context.",
  "sources": "User input may influence exception messages; no other data inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and error handling mechanisms that output formatted error strings.",
  "flows": "Input data (error details) flow into exception initializers, which generate formatted error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or malicious patterns observed; code mainly consists of standard exception class definitions and a simple path rendering function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for API error handling, including mechanisms to include error details and paths. The 'render_path' function constructs string representations of data paths, mainly for debugging or error reporting. There are no network operations, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The exception handling is standard and designed for clarity and debugging support. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for an API client, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and purely for error handling.",
