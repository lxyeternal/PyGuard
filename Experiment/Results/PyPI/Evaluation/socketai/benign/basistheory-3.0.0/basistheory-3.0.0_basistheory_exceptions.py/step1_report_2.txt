  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API-related errors in an OpenAPI context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from HTTP responses (http_resp object) and exception messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception message construction, especially in __str__ method, which outputs detailed error information including headers and body.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with HTTP response data, and __str__ generates detailed error strings based on this data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard exception handling is used. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base OpenApiException. These are used to handle specific HTTP errors and API issues, storing relevant response data and formatting error messages. The render_path function converts a list of path components into a string. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a standard exception handling module intended for API error management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical exception handling module for API error responses, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It operates solely on error data and formats messages accordingly.",
