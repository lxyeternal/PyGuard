  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for the Basis Theory API client, including authentication, logging, SSL settings, and host management.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters such as host, api_key, api_key_prefix, username, password, and external environment variables.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request headers (API key, basic auth), SSL certificate files, and log files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to internal attributes; api_key and api_key_prefix to get_api_key_with_prefix; username/password to get_basic_auth_token; host and server variables to get_host_from_settings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated configuration class for API interaction, handling authentication, logging, SSL, and host settings. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Sensitive data like API keys or credentials are handled via parameters or environment, not hardcoded. No suspicious network activity or malicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a standard SDK configuration setup with proper separation of concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, generated SDK configuration class with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It manages API credentials, logging, and connection settings securely and transparently.",
