  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK configuration class for Basis Theory API, managing credentials, logging, server settings, and validation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Data flows involve secure handling of API keys and credentials.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, indicating no concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK configuration with proper management of authentication, logging, SSL, and host settings.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation. Handles credentials securely.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with benign code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration management, including API keys, server URLs, and authentication headers.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Standard practices observed.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign, standard SDK configuration.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, managing API keys, SSL, logging, and server URLs.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or backdoors. Handles data securely.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured configuration class.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical SDK configuration with focus on credentials, server URLs, and logging.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Data flows are standard.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is standard SDK configuration code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the code follows typical patterns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and low security risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware justification:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code manages credentials and configuration data securely and transparently.\n- **Assumptions and claims:** All claims are based on standard code review observations; no unwarranted assumptions detected.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, generated SDK code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — very low, as the code handles sensitive data properly and contains no suspicious patterns.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code's purpose is configuration management, which inherently involves handling sensitive data like API keys and credentials. However, these are managed via parameters, not hardcoded secrets.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code's structure and logic are standard for SDKs, with no indicators of supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard SDK configuration class for the Basis Theory API. It manages credentials, logging, SSL, and server settings securely, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (very low, due to handling of sensitive data, but no issues detected)\n\nThis assessment aligns with all reports and the detailed analysis.",
