  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Setup configuration for the SDK package.\n- Findings: Reads dependencies, README.md, and invokes setup().\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Logical assessment: All operations are standard for a setup script; no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, no network activity.\n- Malware, obfuscated code, or security risks: None.\n- **Score justification:** The report correctly identifies no malicious activity, and the score of 0 for malware and security risk is appropriate. The confidence of 1 is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, standard package setup.\n- Findings: Reads README.md, no suspicious code.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Logical assessment: Standard package configuration, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- Malware, obfuscated code, or security risks: None.\n- **Score justification:** The assessment is accurate; scores of 0 for malware and security risk are correct, confidence is 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Findings: Reads README.md, no suspicious behavior.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Logical assessment: Typical setup script, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware, obfuscated code, or security risks: None.\n- **Score justification:** Correctly assigned scores; no issues detected, confidence 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Findings: Reads README.md, no suspicious activity.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Logical assessment: No malicious or suspicious code, typical package configuration.\n- Malware, obfuscated code, or security risks: None.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate scores; no malicious intent or security issues identified, confidence 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Findings: Reads README.md, no suspicious code.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Logical assessment: No dynamic code, no untrusted data handling, typical boilerplate.\n- Malware, obfuscated code, or security risks: None.\n- **Score justification:** Correctly assigned scores; no malicious or security concerns, confidence 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code is purely package setup boilerplate, the malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is standard, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nBased on the detailed review, **the current scores are appropriate and consistent** with the code's nature. The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign, boilerplate package setup script.",
