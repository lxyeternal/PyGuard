  "purpose": "Setup script for the BasisTheory Python SDK package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the contents of README.md for long_description, and static metadata variables such as NAME, REQUIRES, and package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe or untrusted data sinks are present. The script does not execute untrusted code or handle user input.",
  "flows": "Reads static data and file content, then passes this data to setuptools setup function for package creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detected. All code is standard packaging boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: importing modules, defining package metadata, reading README content, and calling setup(). No untrusted data sources, code execution, or external calls beyond package configuration are present. The content is typical for a Python package setup script and shows no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only manages package metadata and dependencies, with no security risks identified.",
