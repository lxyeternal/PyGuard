  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any security concerns are justified.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It performs typical operations: importing setup tools, reading a README file, defining package metadata, and invoking `setup()`.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network communication, or handling of untrusted data.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this script.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup configuration for the SDK.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard, and the confidence is high.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The script is straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines package metadata.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Package setup.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Packaging script.\n- **Findings:** Standard boilerplate, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports. No malware activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately scored. There are no security concerns with this script.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or modifications, but based on the current code and reports, this package setup script is safe.",
