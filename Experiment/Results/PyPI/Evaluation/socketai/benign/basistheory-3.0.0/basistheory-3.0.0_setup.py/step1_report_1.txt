  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the BasisTheory Python SDK package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, reading README.md file, and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data; the code primarily sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies and long description from files, then passes data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, defines package metadata, reads long description from a file, and invokes setup() with the gathered data. No dynamic code execution, no input handling from untrusted sources, and no network communication or sensitive data processing are present. All operations are typical for package setup scripts and do not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
