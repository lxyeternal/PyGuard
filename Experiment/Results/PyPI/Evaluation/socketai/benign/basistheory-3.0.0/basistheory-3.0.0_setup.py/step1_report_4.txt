  "purpose": "Setup script for the BasisTheory Python SDK package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the file 'README.md' in the current directory.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send untrusted data externally; it primarily processes local files and defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads content from 'README.md' and uses it in package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements are present. The script performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script utilizing setuptools. It imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for the long description, and configures package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging the SDK and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
