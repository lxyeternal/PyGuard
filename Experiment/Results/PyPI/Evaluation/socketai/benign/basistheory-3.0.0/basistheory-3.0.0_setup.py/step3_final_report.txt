  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for the SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from REQUIRES list, reads README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies and README content, then passes them to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static file reading and setup invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, performing static file reads and package metadata definition. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All operations are standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a standard setup configuration. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
