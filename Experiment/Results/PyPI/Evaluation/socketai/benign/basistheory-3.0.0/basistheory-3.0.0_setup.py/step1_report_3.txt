{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the BasisTheory Python SDK package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package information for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the filesystem (README.md) and from user-provided package files during installation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no points where untrusted data influences system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the long_description variable during package setup, with no other data flow paths involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, reads the README file for long description, and calls setup() to prepare the package for distribution. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no code execution, network activity, or data manipulation beyond filesystem reads. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package and does not contain malware or security risks. It simply configures the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
