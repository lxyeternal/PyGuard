{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python SDK package named 'basistheory', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data; it primarily loads static package data.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from the filesystem reading 'README.md' into the 'long_description' variable, which is then used in the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; the script appears to be a standard Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with appropriate parameters. No input validation, user data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The code aligns with typical Python package configuration scripts. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
