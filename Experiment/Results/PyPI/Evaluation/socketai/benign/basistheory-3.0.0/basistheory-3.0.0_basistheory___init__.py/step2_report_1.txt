  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely import statements and a version string, with no runtime or dynamic behavior. No secrets, network activity, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — all consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as Report 1; static import code with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Identical to previous; straightforward setup with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same benign static import code; no anomalies or secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly different; mentions a comment about placing an API key into a variable, which is a standard instruction, not an embedded secret. No actual API key or secret is present.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware=0 (no malicious activity)\n  - obfuscated=0 (no obfuscation)\n  - securityRisk=0.1 (a minimal, perhaps cautious, acknowledgment of potential user misconfiguration)\n- **Justification for risk score:** The comment about inserting an API key might be misinterpreted as a potential security concern, but since no secret is embedded, and it's merely instructive, a low risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable, though perhaps a slightly higher risk score could be justified if we consider user misconfiguration, but 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** All 0 or very low, matching the benign static nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Code presence:** No issues or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores consistency:** All appropriate.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on static analysis.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, risk:** All accurately reflected.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minor note about API key placement, which is just documentation, not actual code behavior)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign SDK setup with no security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the static analysis.",
