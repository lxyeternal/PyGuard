{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a minimal setup for importing modules and classes related to the Basis Theory API, likely for use in a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are directly read within this code; it only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data outputs or network communications directly initiated in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely import statements and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The comment about placing an API key into a variable is just documentation, not actual code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and a version declaration. The comments provide guidance on API usage and setup but do not include any dynamic or potentially malicious code. No input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious code behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign setup for a Python module that interfaces with the Basis Theory API. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
