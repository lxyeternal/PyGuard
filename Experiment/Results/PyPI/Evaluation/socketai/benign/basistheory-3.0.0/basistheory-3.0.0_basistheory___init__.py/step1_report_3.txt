{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python module that provides an interface to the Basis Theory API, importing necessary classes and exceptions for API interaction.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'basistheory' package: 'api_client', 'configuration', and various exception classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, user input, or network data within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this static code; it only imports classes and sets up version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of comments, version info, and import statements from a third-party package 'basistheory'. No runtime or dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no network activity are evident. The comment suggests a manual process for inserting API keys, but no such key is present here. All imported modules are standard for API interaction, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward setup for a Python client module interacting with the Basis Theory API. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks based on the static analysis of the provided content.",
