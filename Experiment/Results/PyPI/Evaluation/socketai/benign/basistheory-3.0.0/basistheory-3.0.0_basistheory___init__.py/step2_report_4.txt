  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as import/setup for Basis Theory API client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows; purely import statements.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; comment about API key placement is just instructional.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; standard SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 (initially), but since no issues are present, a risk score of 0 seems more appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms benign nature.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5, but again, no issues detected, so risk should be 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same findings: straightforward import/setup, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5, but no evidence suggests risk, so risk should be 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above; no suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5, but given the benign nature, risk should be 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly more cautious, mentions the comment about API key placement.\n- Scores: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, which is reasonable given the comment about API key placement (a standard instruction, not a secret or malicious code).\n- The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), which is acceptable given the cautious note.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** The initial risk scores of 0.5 seem too high given the benign, static nature of the code. Since there's no dynamic behavior, no secrets, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns, the risk score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard import/setup module for an SDK.\n- No data leaks, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious imports.\n- The only mention of API key placement is in comments, which is a common instruction, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score  |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Malware            | 0       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       |\n| Risk               | 0       |\n\nThis aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores overstate the security risk. I recommend setting all risk scores to **0** to accurately reflect the benign, non-malicious nature of this code snippet.",
