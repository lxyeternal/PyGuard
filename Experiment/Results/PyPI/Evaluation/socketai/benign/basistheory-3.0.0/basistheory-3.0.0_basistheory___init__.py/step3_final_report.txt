  "purpose": "This code provides import statements and version information for the Basis Theory API SDK, serving as a setup module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'basistheory.api_client', 'basistheory.configuration', and 'basistheory.exceptions'; version string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static import setup with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Comment instructing users to insert an API key into a variable, but no such variable or secret is embedded; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version info, and a comment. No dynamic behavior, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The comment about placing an API key is purely instructional and does not indicate embedded secrets. The code is a standard SDK setup module, with no signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for SDK initialization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 accurately reflect its safe nature.",
