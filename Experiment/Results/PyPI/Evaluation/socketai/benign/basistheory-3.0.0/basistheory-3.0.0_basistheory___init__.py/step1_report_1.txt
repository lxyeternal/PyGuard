{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an initial setup or import section for a Python client library interacting with the Basis Theory API, intended to facilitate API calls and handle exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and classes from the 'basistheory' package, as well as a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sink points like network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The comment suggests placing an API key in a variable, but the variable is not shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of comments and import statements, with no execution or data handling. There is a mention of an API key, but no such key is stored or used here. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The presence of exception classes and API client configuration indicates typical setup code for a Python SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python API client library with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions.",
