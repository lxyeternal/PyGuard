  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward import/setup module with no network activity, no secrets, and no anomalies. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are reasonable given the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with no suspicious activity or anomalies. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a benign import/setup code with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly different in that it notes a comment about placing an API key into a variable, but clarifies that no key is present in the code. The reasoning emphasizes that this is a user instruction, not a secret or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report assigns a very low security risk (0.1) due to the comment, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, import-based, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The mention of the API key in comments does not constitute a security risk, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk in static code)\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious, given the static nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign SDK setup module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scoring aligns well with the static analysis.",
