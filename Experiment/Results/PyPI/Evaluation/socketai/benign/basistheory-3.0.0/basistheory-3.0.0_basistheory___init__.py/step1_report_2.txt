  "purpose": "The code serves as an import and setup module for the Basis Theory API, providing version info and importing necessary classes and exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'basistheory' package modules, such as api_client, configuration, and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no data is being written or sent to external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly imports modules and sets up version info.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The comment about API key placement is purely instructional and does not reveal the key.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements with version info and comments. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are present. No network activity, cryptographic operations, or data leaks are observed. The mention of API key is in a comment, not executed code, and no secrets are hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as part of an API client setup. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk detected.",
