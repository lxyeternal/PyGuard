{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and imports components for a Python SDK to interact with the Basis Theory API, facilitating API calls and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'basistheory' package, including API client, configuration, and exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present. No external data or user input processing is visible.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and sets up for further use; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment suggesting a potential security concern ('Paste the API Key into the `BT-API-KEY` variable'), but no actual API key handling or hardcoded secrets are shown in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of comments, version declaration, and import statements from a known SDK package. The only notable point is the mention of an API key in the comments, which is a standard instruction for users to configure their API key securely. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are present. The code structure and content suggest standard SDK initialization without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign SDK setup for interacting with Basis Theory API. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The comment about pasting an API key is a typical user instruction, not embedded secret or malicious code.",
