  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or external data sources involved.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The package data, URLs, and other metadata are all publicly accessible and related to the Python typing ecosystem.\n- The scripts do not contain any network calls, code injection, or runtime actions beyond package configuration.\n\n**Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious activity or behavior.\n   - Given the static nature and absence of suspicious code, this is appropriate.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or payload.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, indicating code clarity and straightforwardness.\n   - The code is simple, with no obfuscation techniques or hidden logic.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign a score of 0, citing no vulnerabilities or security issues.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, does not perform network operations, and uses only static data.\n\n**Analysis of the reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; all conclusions are based on static analysis.\n- The scores assigned align with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n- Given the evidence, no changes are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is a standard, well-formed setup script for packaging a Python stub library.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.",
