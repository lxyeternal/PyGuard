{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python typing stub package 'types-mock' intended for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The script reads package metadata, version info, URLs, dependencies, package data, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The data flows are mainly static assignments from variables to setup() parameters; no dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected. The script uses standard setuptools conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static metadata. All information appears legitimate and typical for package distribution. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The URLs point to trusted sources related to Python's typing project. No data leakage, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup script for packaging a Python stub module. It contains no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
