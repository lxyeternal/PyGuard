  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'types-mock' library, providing type stubs for the 'mock' package.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, URLs, and package data within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic input, network calls, or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "The static metadata flows directly into the setup() function without external or untrusted data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses reputable URLs. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script with static data, no dynamic or malicious behavior. All URLs point to trusted sources. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The security risk score should also be zero, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious activities. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The current scores are appropriate; the overall security risk score should be set to 0.",
