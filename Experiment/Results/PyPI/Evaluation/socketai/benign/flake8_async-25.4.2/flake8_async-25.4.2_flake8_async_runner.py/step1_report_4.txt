{
  "purpose": "This code implements a framework for running static analysis checks on Python code, specifically for the Flake8Async plugin. It traverses AST and CST trees to identify issues and manage visitor states.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the AST and CST nodes during traversal, notably in 'visit' methods and the 'run' methods; options are read during initialization; 'node' in 'visit' method is an input source.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calling visitor methods with nodes (which could process untrusted data), modifying shared state like 'problems' and 'noqas', and handling of visitor states; however, no data outputs or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from AST/CST nodes flows through visitor methods that check node types, process them, and update internal state such as 'problems' and 'noqas'. The 'run' methods initiate traversal and yield errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code structure appears typical for a static analysis framework, with no obfuscated or unusual language features. The 'visit' method manipulates visitor sets dynamically, but this is standard for visitor pattern implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static analysis runner for Flake8Async, with separate classes for AST and CST processing. It employs visitor patterns with utility and error-checking visitors, managing state through shared 'SharedState'. The traversal involves calling specific 'visit_' methods for node types, managing 'novisit' flags to prevent redundant visits. There are no indications of data leaks, external connections, or malicious system modifications. The handling of 'noqas' and problem list is internal, used for reporting issues. The code does not handle untrusted data from external sources beyond standard AST nodes, and there are no suspicious network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a static analysis framework for Python, focusing on AST and CST traversal to identify code issues. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious external communications. The overall security risk is very low.",
