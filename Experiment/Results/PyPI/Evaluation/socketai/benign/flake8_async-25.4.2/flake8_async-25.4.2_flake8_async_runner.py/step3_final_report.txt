{
  "purpose": "The code implements a static analysis framework for Python, utilizing AST and CST visitors to traverse code structures, manage shared state, and classify errors without executing external code or performing malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from AST and CST nodes during traversal; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows are confined within internal analysis processes, with no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Traversal source points are AST and CST nodes; data flows through visitor methods updating shared state and problem lists; no external data or untrusted sources are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code structure is straightforward and standard for static analysis tools.",
  "analysis": "The code defines visitor-based classes for AST and CST traversal, managing shared state, and error classification. It includes conditional logic for disabling NoqaHandler, which is a normal feature toggle. No external data leaks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation patterns are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there are no malicious actions. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clear and standard code structure. The security risk score is very low (0.05 to 0.1), reflecting the benign and static nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis framework for Python, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent with its behavior, and the overall security posture is very low risk.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
