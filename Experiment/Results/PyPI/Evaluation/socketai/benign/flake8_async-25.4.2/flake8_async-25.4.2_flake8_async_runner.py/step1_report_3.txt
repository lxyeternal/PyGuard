{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for running AST and CST-based code analysis, including utility and error-checking visitors, primarily for linting and static analysis in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the input 'tree' (AST) or 'module' (CST), and options provided to the runner. It also reads class attributes and method calls within the visitors.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve calling visitor methods that could process untrusted AST/CST nodes. However, no data flows from external untrusted sources directly into sensitive functions. The code does not execute untrusted data or invoke external commands.",
  "flows": "The flow involves traversing AST or CST nodes with visitor methods, which process code structures. These visits do not involve dangerous data manipulation or external calls, only static traversal.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code appears standard for a static analysis tool, with no hidden or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes static analysis runners with utility and error-detection visitors, managing state and controlling which visitors run based on options. The methods perform AST/CST traversal and manage visitor states, without executing external or sensitive operations. No dynamic code execution, network access, or system modifications are present. The code is well-structured, typical of a static analysis framework, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a static analysis framework for Python code, focused on linting and error detection. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its design and implementation do not suggest any sabotage, malware, or data exfiltration attempts.",
