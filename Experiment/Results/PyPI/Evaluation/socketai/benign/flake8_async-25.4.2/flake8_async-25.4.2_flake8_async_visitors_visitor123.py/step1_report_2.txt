{
  "purpose": "The code defines an AST visitor class for static analysis of exception handling patterns, particularly related to exception groups and nested exceptions in Python.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from AST nodes representing code structures such as exception handlers, assignments, and loops.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code primarily performs static analysis without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code analyzes source nodes (_is_exception_group, _is_child_exception, etc.) and updates internal sets accordingly, without executing external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code structure is clear and intended for static code analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a static analysis visitor that tracks exception group and child exception names within Python AST nodes. It carefully manages state across exception handlers and try-star constructs (Python 3.11+). No external data, network operations, or runtime code execution is involved. The code does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation; it appears as a legitimate utility for analyzing exception handling structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static analysis tool component, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations or data leaks; its purpose is to analyze Python exception handling constructs safely.",
