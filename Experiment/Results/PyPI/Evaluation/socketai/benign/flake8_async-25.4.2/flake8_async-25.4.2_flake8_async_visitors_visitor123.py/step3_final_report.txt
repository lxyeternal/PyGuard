  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for exception handling, focusing on exception groups and related constructs.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing exception handling, such as 'Raise', 'ExceptHandler', 'Assign', 'For', and 'TryStar' nodes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal state updates and error reporting via 'self.error()' based on exception patterns.",
  "flows": "Source nodes (exception-related AST nodes) influence internal state and error reporting; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured static AST visitor designed to analyze exception handling patterns, especially exception groups, in Python code. It tracks exception group names, child exception lists, and exception variables, and reports errors if child exceptions are raised directly. No external system interactions, network calls, or data leaks are present. The logic is consistent, with correct handling of Python 3.11+ features like 'TryStar'. The code performs pattern recognition without executing or modifying code at runtime. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The purpose is to enforce or analyze exception handling patterns safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility focused on exception handling, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate safe, straightforward code intended for pattern detection. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, aligning with its benign nature.",
