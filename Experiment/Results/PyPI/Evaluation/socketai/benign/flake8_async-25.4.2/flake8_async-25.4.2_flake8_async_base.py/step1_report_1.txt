{
  "purpose": "Provide base classes, utility functions, and data structures used across a package for error handling, options configuration, and statement representation.",
  "sources": "Function definitions (`strip_error_subidentifier`, `error_has_subidentifier`), class initializers (`Options`, `Statement`, `Error`), class methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow pathways identified. The functions process input strings or class attributes but do not perform any dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The code consists of standard data classes and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and data structures typical for a Python project. `strip_error_subidentifier` parses error code strings; `error_has_subidentifier` checks for underscores. The `Options` dataclass encapsulates configuration options; `Statement` models code statements with equality and hashing logic; `Error` models error information with formatting and comparison methods. There is no dynamic code execution, network access, or other malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured foundation for error and option management in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely infrastructural, providing utility functions and data models without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks. It appears safe and normal for its purpose.",
