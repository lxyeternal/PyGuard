  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining utility functions, data classes, and structures for error handling, options, and statement representation.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code appears to be standard infrastructure code for a larger package.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which seems consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code Functionality:** All functions and classes perform straightforward tasks—string splitting, collection checks, data encapsulation, and formatting.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **External Data:** No external data sources or network activity.\n- **Data Handling:** Only internal data transformations, with no handling of untrusted input that could lead to security issues.\n- **Error Handling:** Error class formats messages but does not execute or interpret untrusted code.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and standard; no obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0. Since no security risks are evident, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Adjustments:\n\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments seem accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This code is purely infrastructural, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility module for error and configuration management. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
