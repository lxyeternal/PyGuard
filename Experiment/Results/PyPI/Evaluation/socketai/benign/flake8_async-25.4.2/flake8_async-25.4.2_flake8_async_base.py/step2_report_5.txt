  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists of utility functions (`strip_error_subidentifier`, `error_has_subidentifier`) and data classes (`Options`, `Statement`, `Error`) for error handling and configuration.\n- No external data input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The functions operate on strings and collections with straightforward logic.\n- The classes provide data encapsulation, equality, hashing, and formatting, all standard practices.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected.\n- The code appears to be infrastructural, intended for internal use within a larger package.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic execution, network access, or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No indications of supply chain risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - The functions and classes are standard and do not rely on external untrusted data.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n   - The only minor point is the `__eq__` method in `Statement`, which considers `col_offset` as a wildcard when set to -1, but this is a deliberate design choice and not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for internal utility modules.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
