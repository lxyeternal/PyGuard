{
  "purpose": "Provides base classes and utility functions for handling errors, options, and statements across a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class attributes, and module imports. No external untrusted data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data flows into critical operations such as system commands, network, or file writes.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present. The functions and classes operate on internal data or parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for string processing and classes to encapsulate options, statements, and error data. It employs standard Python features like dataclasses, NamedTuple, and class methods. No code injection, dynamic execution, or external resource access is observed. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign component providing structured data handling and utility functions for a larger project. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks in this module.",
