{
  "purpose": "Defines base classes and utility functions for error handling and configuration management across the package.",
  "sources": "Constantly used functions and class constructors; no external data input sources are apparent.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data transformations are local and static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected. All functions and classes are straightforward and serve standard purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures (`Options`, `Statement`, `Error`) and utility functions for string manipulation related to error codes. No external input handling, network operations, or sensitive data management are present. The functions operate on strings and collections without any dynamic execution or data leakage mechanisms. The use of type hints and class methods is standard. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility classes and functions intended for error management and configuration in a larger project. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be well-structured and safe.",
