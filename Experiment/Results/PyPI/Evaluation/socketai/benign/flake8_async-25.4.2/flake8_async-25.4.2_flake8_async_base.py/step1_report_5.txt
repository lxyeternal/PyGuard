{
  "purpose": "This module provides base classes and utility functions for handling error codes, options, and statement representations within a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from function arguments, class attributes, and type hints. No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted error messages via the 'format_message' and '__str__' methods, but these are for logging and do not process untrusted data from external sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and internal variables into formatted messages and class instances, with no indication of untrusted data influencing control flow or system behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and well-structured. No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. No suspicious dynamic execution or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and utility functions for managing errors and options within a Python package. Functions operate on string inputs, mainly splitting or checking for underscores, which is benign. The classes manage options, statements, and error information, with no evidence of malicious intent. No external data sources or sinks are involved that could lead to data leaks or malicious behavior. The formatting functions create error messages for display, but do not execute or interpret untrusted code. Overall, the code is standard, supporting package functionality without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard infrastructure code with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as part of a larger package to handle error and option management, with no suspicious activities detected.",
