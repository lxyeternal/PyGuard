  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the security assessments are justified, considering the code, its logic, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is purely infrastructural, defining data classes, utility functions, and error handling structures.\n- No dynamic code execution, network access, file I/O, or external data handling is present.\n- Functions operate on strings or internal data; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and typical for a package's internal utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, purely infrastructural.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified; no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with no external data handling or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** No external input, no data leaks, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard internal utility code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard code with no external data or dynamic execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Summary:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are correctly 0; no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is standard infrastructure code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood within its context.",
