{
  "purpose": "Provides base classes, utility functions, and data structures for internal package operations, including error handling and configuration options.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources; primarily defines classes and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used insecurely or could cause data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the functions and classes operate on internal data only.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard internal package code with no unusual or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for string manipulation, data classes for configuration options, and error handling classes. It avoids dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling from external sources. No indicators of malicious intent, such as backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms, are present. The structure and content align with typical package infrastructure code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign internal utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to structure data and configuration for the package's internal operations without involving external data or sensitive actions.",
