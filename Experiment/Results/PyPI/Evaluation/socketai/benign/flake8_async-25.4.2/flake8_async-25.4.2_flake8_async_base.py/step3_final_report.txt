{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions, data classes, and error handling structures for internal package management, including error code processing, configuration options, statement representation, and error formatting.",
  "sources": "String operations in 'strip_error_subidentifier' and 'error_has_subidentifier'; data collections in 'Options'; data attributes in 'Statement' and 'Error' classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; functions operate on internal data without external input/output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for string manipulation, data classes for configuration options and code statements, and an error class for error reporting. It performs simple, well-understood operations without external data access, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure and logic are clear, and the code serves as infrastructure for larger systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely infrastructural, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. All signals and assessments are consistent with its benign nature.",
