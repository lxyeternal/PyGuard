  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions and data classes for error handling, options configuration, and statement representation.\n- No dynamic code execution, network access, or external data handling is present.\n- The functions operate on strings and collections, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- The classes are standard, with no suspicious behavior.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious logic.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- No logical errors or mistakes are evident.\n- The only minor point is that in the `Statement` class, the equality method considers `col_offset` as a wildcard if either is -1, which is intentional and acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No errors or flaws detected.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Suggestion:** No change needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5 for malware, obfuscated, or security risk.\n- The code is infrastructural, utility functions, and data models, which are inherently low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification needed for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Some reports mention that the code \"does not perform any dangerous operations\" and \"no external data is read or written.\"\n- This is accurate; no assumptions are being made that are unsupported.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores and reasoning are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe, infrastructural component with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious behavior or code execution present.            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious patterns.    |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and safe.**",
