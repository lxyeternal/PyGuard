{
  "purpose": "This code defines multiple custom static analysis visitors for Flake8 to enforce coding standards and best practices related to asynchronous programming in Python, particularly with libraries like trio, anyio, and asyncio.",
  "sources": "The code reads from AST nodes during static analysis, including imports, function definitions, calls, and control flow statements. It also checks for specific patterns in code structure and identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or system interaction are present. The code focuses on code pattern detection rather than data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "The source-to-sink flow involves detecting specific AST patterns (sources) and raising errors or warnings (sinks) when violations are identified, such as unsafe task creation, improper use of sleep, or context manager misplacements.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be well-structured and focused on static code pattern detection; there are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present. No obfuscation or suspicious code injection detected. The import statements, class definitions, and method implementations follow standard static analysis patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple AST visitors that identify potentially unsafe or non-conformant asynchronous code patterns, including misuse of task start methods, incorrect sleep durations, and improper context manager usage. The pattern matching relies on helper functions and consistent AST traversal. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or privilege escalation. The code is purely for static code analysis and enforces best practices for async programming.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains no malicious behavior; it is a collection of static analysis tools aimed at improving code quality and correctness for asynchronous Python code. All patterns are related to code correctness, safety, and style enforcement, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
