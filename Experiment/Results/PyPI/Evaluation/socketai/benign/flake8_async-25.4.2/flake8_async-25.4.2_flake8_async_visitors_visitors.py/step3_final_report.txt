{
  "purpose": "The code defines static analysis classes (Flake8 visitors) for checking Python async code patterns, library usage, and best practices. It aims to identify potential issues and enforce coding standards without executing or modifying runtime behavior.",
  "sources": "AST nodes during static code traversal, including import statements, function definitions, calls, with statements, and control flow constructs.",
  "sinks": "Error reporting via self.error(), which logs issues during static analysis; no external data flows or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching from source AST nodes to error reporting sinks, triggered when specific code patterns are detected (e.g., improper imports, use of sleep, start_soon, or task groups).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard Python AST patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple static analysis classes that traverse Python AST and CST nodes to detect specific async programming patterns and potential misuses. They do not perform any runtime actions, network calls, or system modifications. The logic is based on pattern matching and error reporting, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the clarity and purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static analysis tools for Python async code, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's purpose and structure.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
