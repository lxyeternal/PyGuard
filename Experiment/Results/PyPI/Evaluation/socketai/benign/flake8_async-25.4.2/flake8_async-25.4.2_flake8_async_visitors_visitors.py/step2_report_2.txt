  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risk, and consistency of the scores.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Behavior (Malware Score):**  \nAll reports explicitly state that the code is a collection of static analysis classes for the Flake8 linter, aimed at detecting async code issues and enforcing best practices. They mention no network access, file manipulation, data exfiltration, or any malicious payloads. The code only performs pattern matching on AST nodes and error reporting.  \n**Conclusion:** Malware score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n**2. Obfuscation Score:**  \nThe code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscated language features, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The reports confirm straightforward static analysis logic.  \n**Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n**3. Security Risk Score:**  \nGiven the above, and the fact that the code does not perform any external actions, system modifications, or data leaks, the security risk is negligible. The reports also do not mention any security concerns beyond static code pattern detection.  \n**Conclusion:** Security risk score should be **0** for all reports.\n\n**4. Logical Consistency of Scores:**  \n- The reports assign high confidence (mostly 1.0 or 0.95), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and analysis all point to safe static analysis code.  \n- No report suggests any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**  \n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the consistent, clear static analysis purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n| Aspect                 | Score (per report) | Justification                                              |\n|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware                | 0                   | No malicious activity or payloads detected.                  |\n| Obfuscated             | 0                   | Code is clear, well-structured, no obfuscation.             |\n| Security Risk          | 0                   | No external system interaction or vulnerabilities.         |\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious or security-compromising elements.",
