{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for executing a Python module as a script, initializing the main functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the sys module for command-line execution and imports the main module within the package.",
  "sinks": "The sys.exit(main()) call executes the main function and exits the program with its return value.",
  "flows": "The code flow is: import sys -> import main -> execute main() -> sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for a Python package entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for system operations, then imports a local main module, and calls main() within sys.exit() to terminate the script with the main function's return code. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated patterns. The code appears to be a typical entry script for a Python package, designed solely to invoke the main module logic when executed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to run the main module upon execution, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
