{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for executing the main module of a Python package using 'python -m'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data directly; it imports the 'main' module and executes it.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main()' and exits with its return value; potential sink is the execution of 'main()'.",
  "flows": "Execution flow: script is run -> imports main module -> calls main() -> sys.exit() with main()'s result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward, serving as a standard entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'main' module relative to its package and executes its main() function, then exits with the returned status code. There are no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code, no network operations, and no data leaks. The code structure is typical for Python package entry points and contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign entry point script for a Python package. It performs no malicious actions and contains no security risks.",
