  "purpose": "Entry point script that executes the main function of the package/module.",
  "sources": "The script reads command-line input via sys and imports the main module.",
  "sinks": "Calls sys.exit() with the result of main(), which may terminate the process.",
  "flows": "Command-line invocation → import main → execute main() → sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard entry point pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and a main module, then executes main() and exits with its return value. No suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no external network activity, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward entry point for a Python package or application.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard application entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
