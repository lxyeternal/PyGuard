  "purpose": "This script serves as the entry point for executing a Python package module directly with `python -m`.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, and imports the 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "Calls the main() function, which may contain further logic; no direct sinks in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports 'main', then executes main() which is called via sys.exit, passing its return value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard pattern for package entry points, importing and executing a main function. It does not contain any suspicious operations, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. It simply manages control flow to run the package's main logic and exit with its return code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign package entry script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
