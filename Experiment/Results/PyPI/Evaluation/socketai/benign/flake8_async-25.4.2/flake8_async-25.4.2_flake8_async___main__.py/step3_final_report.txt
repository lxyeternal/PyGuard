{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the entry point for a Python package, executing the main module and exiting with its return code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import of sys and the local main module, and the execution of main() function.",
  "sinks": "The main() function's output could potentially be used as an exit code, but no untrusted data flows or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow is: import sys and main, then call main() and exit with its return value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python entry point script. It imports sys and a local main module, then executes main() within sys.exit(). No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is evident. The structure is typical for CLI tools. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The security risk score is low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
