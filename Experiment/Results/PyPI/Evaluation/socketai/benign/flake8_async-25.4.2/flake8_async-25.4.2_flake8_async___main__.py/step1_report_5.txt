{
  "purpose": "This script serves as an entry point for executing a Python package or module using the command line with `python -m`.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the `sys` module, specifically `sys.exit`, and imports the `main` module within the package.",
  "sinks": "The code calls `sys.exit()` with the result of `main()`, which could potentially terminate the program based on `main`'s output.",
  "flows": "Input from the `sys` module (via `sys.exit`) flows into program termination; the `main()` function's output influences the exit status.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present; the code is minimal and standard for a Python package entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the `sys` module and a local `main` module, then executes `main()` and exits with its return value. This is typical for CLI entry points. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The use of `sys.exit(main())` is standard for controlling script exit status. No obfuscation, malicious injections, or abnormal patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard entry point for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
