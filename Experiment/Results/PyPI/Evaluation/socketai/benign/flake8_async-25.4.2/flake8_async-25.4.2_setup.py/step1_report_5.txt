{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up and configuring the 'flake8-async' Python package, including extracting version info, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__init__.py' file to extract '__version__' and reads 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present. The code reads files for configuration and metadata, which are controlled sources in the context of setup scripts.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file and uses it in setup; reads long description from a file; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code structure is typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script opens and reads a Python file to extract version information, then uses setuptools to configure the package with metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All file operations are controlled and standard for package setup. No untrusted input handling, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs standard setup tasks with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly reads version info and package metadata without any suspicious operations.",
