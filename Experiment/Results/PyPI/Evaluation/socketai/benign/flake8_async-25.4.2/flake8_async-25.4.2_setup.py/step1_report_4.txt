{
  "purpose": "Main setup and configuration script for the 'flake8-async' Python package, used to prepare the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the __init__.py file to extract the version string; reads README.md for long description; no external or untrusted input sources observed.",
  "sinks": "Uses the setuptools.setup() function to define package metadata; no direct sinks that execute untrusted code or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file, then passes static data into setup(), no flow of untrusted data to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution observed. The version extraction relies on a simple string split, which is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reads version info from a specific file, sets package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. All file operations are local and static. No user input or external data influences the code execution. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or credential handling. The code adheres to common Python packaging patterns and contains no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
