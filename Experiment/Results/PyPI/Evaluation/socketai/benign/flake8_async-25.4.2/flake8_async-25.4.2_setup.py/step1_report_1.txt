{
  "purpose": "Setup and configuration script for the 'flake8-async' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading __init__.py for __version__; reading README.md for long_description; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data reads are from local files only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses straightforward setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the package version from a local __init__.py file and the long description from README.md, both local files. It then calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
