{
  "purpose": "This code sets up and configures the 'flake8-async' Python package, defining its metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file for version info, reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data outputs, network calls, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flow or external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be standard setup script for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version string from an internal __init__.py file, then uses setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. No external input handling, network operations, or code execution occurs. The reading of README.md for long_description is a normal pattern. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or system modifications.",
