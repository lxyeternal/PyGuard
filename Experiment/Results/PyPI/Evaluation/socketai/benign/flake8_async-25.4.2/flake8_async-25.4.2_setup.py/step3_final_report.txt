  "purpose": "Standard setup and configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from __init__.py, reading README.md for long description, static package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, code execution, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reading local files -> parsing version string -> passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads version info from a local __init__.py file via string splitting, reads README.md for description, and calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters. There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The version extraction method is straightforward and safe. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code adheres to standard practices, with no obfuscation or secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
