{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract base classes for AST and CST visitors used for static code analysis, specifically for the Flake8 plugin system, to identify code issues and enforce style or security rules.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from AST and CST nodes, particularly their line and column metadata, and from shared state variables like 'options', 'library', and 'problems'. It also reads node-specific data such as 'lineno' and 'col_offset'.",
  "sinks": "Error reporting via appending Error objects to the shared state's problems list; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Source data from nodes (line, column, and node attributes) flow into the error() methods where errors are conditionally generated and appended to the problems list, based on options and node metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network connections, or obfuscated code. The code primarily manages internal state and metadata for static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract visitor classes, one for AST and one for CST, with methods for managing state, error reporting, and navigation of code structure. Error codes are validated against options, and errors are logged with positional metadata. There are no code injection points, external system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code functions as part of a static analysis framework, not executing external or malicious actions. All data flows are contained within the analysis process, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for static code analysis in Python, focused on managing analysis state and error reporting. It does not contain any malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe and solely intended for internal use within a code quality or security analysis tool.",
