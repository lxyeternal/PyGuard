  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines base classes for AST and CST visitors in static analysis; reads from AST nodes, shared state, options, error codes, and metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Errors are appended to a shared problems list; no external data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded secrets, network calls, dynamic code, or obfuscation. The code handles error reporting and state management in a standard way.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate static analysis infrastructure; no malicious behavior. Risk score: **0**. Malware: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar base classes for AST and CST visitors; reads class attributes, node metadata, options, and error codes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Errors stored in a list; no external data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No secrets or malicious code; the default 'library' tuple with 'trio' is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard static analysis components; no signs of malicious activity. Risk score: **0**. Malware: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines visitors for static analysis, including state management and error logging.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Errors appended to a list; uses node metadata.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or backdoors. Use of 'assert' and metadata is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard static analysis pattern; no malicious behavior. Risk score: **0**. Malware: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar classes for AST and CST visitors, error handling, and state management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Errors appended to a list; no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe static analysis code; no malicious activity. Risk score: **0**. Malware: **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Base classes for static analysis; reads from nodes, metadata, and internal state.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Errors stored locally; no external data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical static analysis infrastructure; no malware or malicious intent. Risk score: **0**. Malware: **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Functionality:** All reports agree that this code implements static analysis visitor classes, managing internal state, error reporting, and library dependencies.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports find any evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Security Risks:** The only minor concern noted is the use of 'assert' statements and metadata access, which are standard in such tools and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores Justification:** Given the absence of any malicious indicators, the malware score should be **0**. The obfuscated score is **0** as no obfuscation is present. The overall risk score should also be **0**, reflecting negligible security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured static analysis infrastructure with no signs of malicious activity.",
