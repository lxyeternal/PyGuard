  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Logic:** Accurately describes the code as a static analysis tool for detecting nesting issues of nursery-like context managers in async code. The analysis correctly identifies the tracking of context managers, nursery calls, and variable usage.\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** No discrepancies; the code is a static analyzer, not executing code or containing malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Clearly states malware score is 0, no obfuscation, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The overall risk is minimal (0.1), consistent with the purpose of static analysis. No security threats are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning and scoring are reasonable. The confidence (0.95) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Logic:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly describes the static analysis intent, focusing on async nursery misuse detection.\n\n- **Code Behavior & Security:** No malicious activity or obfuscation is indicated. The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is low (0.2), consistent with the code's benign static analysis purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable reasoning and scoring. Confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Logic:** Same as above; accurate description of static analysis for nursery usage.\n\n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malicious activity; malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0.\n\n- **Scores:** Security risk is 0.1, matching the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate reasoning and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Logic:** Correctly identifies the code as static analysis for async nursery nesting.\n\n- **Behavior & Security:** No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The analysis matches the code's static pattern detection.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is 0, which is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Logic:** Same as others; accurate description of the static analysis focus.\n\n- **Security & Malware:** No malicious activity, malware score 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.2 is acceptable given the static analysis context.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate reasoning and scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static analysis tool, not executing or containing malicious code.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All malware scores are 0, obfuscation scores are 0, which is accurate.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) for security risk, justified by the code's purpose (static analysis), which does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:** High confidence (0.9–1.0), justified by the clear, straightforward static analysis logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected or implied)\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to static analysis nature, no security threat)\n\n**Overall:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since static analysis tools generally pose minimal security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
