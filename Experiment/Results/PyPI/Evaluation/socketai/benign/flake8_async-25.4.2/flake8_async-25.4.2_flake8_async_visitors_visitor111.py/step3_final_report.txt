  "purpose": "Static analysis tool to detect improper nesting or scope misuse of nursery-like context managers in asynchronous Python code, focusing on trio, anyio, and asyncio.",
  "sources": "AST nodes related to context managers, function calls, variable names, and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "Variable references within the code, particularly in nursery start/soon calls and subsequent variable usage outside scope.",
  "flows": "Tracking context manager definitions, nursery calls, and variable usage to identify scope violations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; straightforward static analysis logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static AST visitor designed to monitor context managers and nursery calls, raising errors if variables referencing nurseries are used outside their intended scope. It does not perform any runtime or network activity, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The purpose is to prevent bugs related to nursery scope misuse. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code, and the high confidence levels reflect the clarity and straightforwardness of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility aimed at ensuring correct async nursery usage. It poses no security threat, contains no malware or obfuscation, and the risk scores are appropriate. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
