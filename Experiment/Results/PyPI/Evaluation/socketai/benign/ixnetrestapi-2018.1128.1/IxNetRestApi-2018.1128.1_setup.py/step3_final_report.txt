  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call: name, description, version, author info, dependencies, URL, license.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static package metadata. It contains no dynamic or runtime code, no external data processing, and no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores, and no issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
