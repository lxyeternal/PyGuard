{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for the Python project 'IxNetRestApi' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, description, version, author info, package list, dependencies, URL, and license from the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks related to untrusted data handling or potential data leaks; no code executes with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A — all data is static and configuration-based; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The script solely defines package metadata without executing any runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools.setup() to specify package metadata, dependencies, and other distribution parameters. It contains only static configuration data with no runtime input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The package metadata appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration for packaging a Python module. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues. The package is intended for distribution and includes only static metadata.",
