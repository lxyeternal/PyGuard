{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python module called 'IxNetRestApi'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the setup() function parameters, such as package name, description, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or user input; the code only sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "The setup() call processes the static data to prepare the package; there are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The script is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package name, description, version, author info, packages, dependencies, URL, and license. All data appears static and related to package configuration. No input/output processing, no code execution beyond standard setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security risks. The package appears legitimate and safe to use.",
