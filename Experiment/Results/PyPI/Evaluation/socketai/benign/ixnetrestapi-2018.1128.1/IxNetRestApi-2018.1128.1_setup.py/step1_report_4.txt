  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'IxNetRestApi' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data within the setup() function (name, description, version, author, email, packages, install_requires, url, license).",
  "sinks": "None; no execution of untrusted data or external code is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the setup script only contains static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions detected. No dynamic execution or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with metadata and dependencies. All fields contain static data, with no code that executes untrusted input or performs network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
