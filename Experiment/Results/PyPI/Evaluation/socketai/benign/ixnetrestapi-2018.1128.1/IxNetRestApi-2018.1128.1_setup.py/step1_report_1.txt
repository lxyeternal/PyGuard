  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'IxNetRestApi' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package metadata (name, description, version, author, etc.) and dependencies ('requests').",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or inputs; the script solely configures package installation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is a static configuration script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to specify package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are detected. The package metadata appears legitimate, and the dependencies are common ('requests').",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
