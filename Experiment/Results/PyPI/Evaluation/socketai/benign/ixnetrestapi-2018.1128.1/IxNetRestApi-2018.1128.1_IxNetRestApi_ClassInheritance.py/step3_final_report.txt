{
  "purpose": "This code provides class extensions for the OpenIxia API library, allowing users to add custom functions while maintaining compatibility with library updates.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules and class constructors; no external input handling or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; placeholder methods do not act as sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is structural and for extension purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; placeholder methods are standard for extension scaffolds.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses inheriting from external modules, mainly adding extension points with placeholder methods. There is no active logic, data processing, or network activity. The import statements and class structures are typical for SDK or API extension code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature aligns with its purpose as a template for user extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard extension scaffold for the OpenIxia Python API library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The existing assessment scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting its structural, non-active nature.",
