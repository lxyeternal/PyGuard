{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates how to extend and inherit from existing OpenIxia library classes to add custom functionality while maintaining compatibility with updates.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.IxNetRestApi, etc.), class instantiation of inherited classes, and method definitions within those classes.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform data output, network communication, or handling of untrusted input directly. The methods are placeholders and do not execute any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, defines classes that inherit from external classes, and adds custom methods. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks with harmful effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains placeholder methods without implementation, which is typical for extension templates. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up class inheritance from external modules, adding placeholder methods for extension. It uses standard Python inheritance and import practices. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are observed. The code structure appears safe and intended for extension of a library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign extension template for a Python library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It provides a framework for customizing and extending functionality without introducing vulnerabilities.",
