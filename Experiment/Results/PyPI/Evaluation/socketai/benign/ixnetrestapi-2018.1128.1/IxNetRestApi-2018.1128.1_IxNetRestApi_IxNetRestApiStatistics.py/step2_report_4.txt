  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code's logic, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a legitimate API client for managing network statistics views, snapshots, and cleanup.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or data exfiltration are detected.\n- The code relies on standard API interactions, file operations, and logging.\n- The reported malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; manages stats views via API, reads data from parameters and API responses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2), consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, legitimate code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the score aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; interacts with IxNetwork, reads from API responses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2), justified by network API interactions, but no actual security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning and scoring are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to above.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 fits.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.1), consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; API interactions, file handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2), but justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard API wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; manages stats views, snapshots, file operations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is justified.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero, as expected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Cross-Check & Recommendations**\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code is a standard API client for network testing tools, with functions for view discovery, data retrieval, snapshot management, and cleanup.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All scores are 0 for malware, which is appropriate. The slight security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are justified given the context of network API interactions and file handling, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Potential Assumptions:** The reports assume the API endpoints and responses are safe and that no external untrusted inputs are processed maliciously. This is reasonable given the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of My Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — justified based on the context but no actual security flaws.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since it interacts with network APIs and handles files, but no vulnerabilities are evident)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears secure, legitimate, and well-structured for its purpose. No further security concerns are identified based on the provided reports and code review.",
