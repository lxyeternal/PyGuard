  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the described behaviors, then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages stats views, retrieves data, snapshots, cleanup. Sources are method parameters, API responses, file paths.\n- **Analysis:** The code uses standard API calls, handles view discovery, version-dependent API usage, and file operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall logic is straightforward, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to standard API interaction, minimal security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on retrieving, snapshots, and view management.\n- **Analysis:** Uses legitimate API endpoints, regex for matching view captions, standard file handling, and logging. No suspicious code or external data flows.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical API client for network stats, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, standard API client, no security issues)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages retrieval, snapshots, removal of views; reads from API responses, parameters, environment variables.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. Uses API calls, logging, file handling. No backdoors, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility for network testing; no malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard operations)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API wrapper for managing network stats, snapshots, cleanup.\n- **Analysis:** Standard API interactions, regex matching, file operations, logging. No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly a legitimate network management utility, with no signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, routine API and file handling)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with focus on view discovery, data retrieval, file management.\n- **Analysis:** Uses typical API calls, JSON parsing, file copying. No malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** A legitimate network automation script, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (no security concern)\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware:** All reports consistently assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly low (0.1-0.2), reflecting routine API and file operations, no evident security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or signatures.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Minimal, mostly due to potential misconfigurations or API failures, but not security risks.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client library for network testing and statistics management.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; all operations are typical for such tools.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided reports and code review, I recommend maintaining the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the overall security risk at approximately 0.1. The code is legitimate, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
