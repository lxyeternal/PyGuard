{
  "purpose": "The code manages retrieval, snapshot, and removal of network statistics views in a testing environment, primarily for use with IxNetwork APIs.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from API responses, method parameters (viewName, file paths, mode), and environment variables (like timestamps).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to log info, writes CSV files, copies files to local paths, and raises exceptions on errors.",
  "flows": "Sources (API responses, parameters) are processed to identify views, then data is retrieved and optionally saved or displayed; file operations and exceptions handle errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior detected. The code uses standard API interactions, logging, and file handling. No obfuscated code, unusual network connections, or data exfiltration attempts observed.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with network API endpoints to gather statistics, using version checks for different API versions, and includes mechanisms to wait for data readiness, search for specific views, and save snapshots. It handles files securely via provided paths and includes error handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, unauthorized network access, or hidden backdoors are present. All operations are consistent with a legitimate network management utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing and retrieving network statistics in a testing environment. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signals. The only notable aspect is its dependency on external APIs and file handling, which are standard for such tools.",
