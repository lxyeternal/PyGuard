{
  "purpose": "The code manages network statistics views, retrieves statistical data, takes snapshots, and cleans up views via API interactions. It supports multiple API versions and handles file operations for snapshots.",
  "sources": "API responses for view discovery, JSON data for statistics, function parameters for view names and file paths, environment variables for paths, and response data for view captions.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints for data retrieval and snapshot creation, file system paths for saving snapshots, and JSON responses containing view captions and data.",
  "flows": "Source: API responses and function parameters -> Processing via regex matching and JSON parsing -> Data stored in dictionaries or written to CSV files -> API calls for snapshots and cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Use of regex for caption matching is standard. No suspicious external data flows or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions for managing and retrieving network statistics views, with proper error handling, version-aware API calls, and file management. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, and the functions serve legitimate purposes in network testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client library for network statistics management. It shows no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal and consistent with routine API and file operations.",
