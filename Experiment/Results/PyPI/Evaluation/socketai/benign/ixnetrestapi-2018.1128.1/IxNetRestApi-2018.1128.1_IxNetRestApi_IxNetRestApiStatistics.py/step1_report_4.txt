{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API wrapper for retrieving, managing, and snapshotting statistics views from an IxNetwork session, likely used for network testing and analysis automation.",
  "sources": "Reads include API responses (get requests for view lists, specific views, page data), input parameters (viewName, file paths), and internal method calls. No external untrusted input is directly processed.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to CSV files; makes API POST requests for snapshot and removal operations; logs information; raises exceptions on errors.",
  "flows": "Uses get requests to retrieve views and statistics data, then writes data to CSV files and logs output. API calls for snapshot and cleanup are made via POST requests. No user-supplied data flows into unsafe commands or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or secrets. No evidence of backdoors, code injection, or obfuscated code. The code handles exceptions properly. No unusual or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script interfaces with an API to retrieve and manage network statistics views, perform snapshots, and cleanup operations. It uses standard Python practices, regular expressions for matching view names, and controlled API interactions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated logic are present. The use of time.sleep and retry loops indicates handling asynchronous API responses. All operations appear legitimate and related to network testing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for network statistics management without any malicious intent or behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. Its primary function is to automate network testing tasks safely.",
