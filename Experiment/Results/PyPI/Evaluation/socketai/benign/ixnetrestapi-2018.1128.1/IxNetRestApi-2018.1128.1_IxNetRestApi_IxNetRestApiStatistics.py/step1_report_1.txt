{
  "purpose": "The code manages statistics views in a network testing tool, allowing retrieval, snapshotting, and cleanup of statistical data from network devices via API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters, API responses (e.g., view list, stats data), and file paths for snapshot files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to CSV files, copies files to local paths, or makes API calls that could manipulate or extract data. No explicit data leaks or unsafe SQL are present.",
  "flows": "API responses (view list and stats data) serve as sources, flowing into data processing, logging, file writing, and file copying sinks. No untrusted data flows into dangerous commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code, malware signatures, or suspicious API interactions. The code appears standard for a network statistics management library.",
  "analysis": "The script interfaces with a network testing API to retrieve and manage statistics views. It includes functions for dynamic view lookup, data retrieval in different API versions, snapshot file management, and cleanup operations. All data flows appear confined within expected API calls and file operations, with appropriate checks for view existence and response readiness. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors. Use of regex for matching view captions is standard, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client library for managing network statistics views, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It performs expected operations securely, without suspicious behavior or security risks.",
