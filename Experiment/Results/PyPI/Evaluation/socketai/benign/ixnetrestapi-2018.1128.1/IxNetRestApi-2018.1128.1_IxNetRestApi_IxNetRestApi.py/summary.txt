  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented API client for IxNetwork with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. It operates as expected for its purpose, with no obfuscation or hidden malicious payloads. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal."
