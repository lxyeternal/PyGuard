  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code presence of malicious activity, logical consistency, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a structured API client for IxNetwork, managing sessions, configurations, and logs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. It uses standard HTTP methods, with SSL verification options, and extensive error handling.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are 0, justified by the absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.1), as it’s a typical network automation client.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior. No signs of sabotage or malicious activity. The high confidence (0.9) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's legitimacy, standard API interactions, and absence of malicious signals. Slightly higher confidence (0.95) due to thorough analysis.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are 0, consistent with the code’s straightforward nature.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2), still low, considering default credentials are common in demo code.\n\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a legitimate API client with standard REST interactions, no signs of malicious behavior, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, justified.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, same reasoning as above.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code’s standard API client nature, with no backdoors or malicious activity. Slightly higher confidence (0.95).\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, justified.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, still low.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a legitimate API client for network testing, with no malicious or sabotage behavior. Full confidence (1.0).\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, consistent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, as it’s a standard API client.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the detailed reasoning. No malicious signals are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, justified by the straightforward, readable code and lack of obfuscation patterns.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, justified by default credentials and typical testing environment considerations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to default credentials and logging, but overall very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and justified.",
