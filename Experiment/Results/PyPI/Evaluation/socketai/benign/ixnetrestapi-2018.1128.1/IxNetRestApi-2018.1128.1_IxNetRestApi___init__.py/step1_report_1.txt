  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script for data processing or configuration, with no explicit malicious intent evident from the visible content.",
  "sources": "Reads data from local files, environment variables, and possibly user input via command-line arguments or standard input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network sockets; may include subprocess calls or external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files, env vars) through processing functions, potentially reaching output sinks (console, files, network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of dynamic code execution or insecure functions appears absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard Python constructs. It reads data from files or environment variables, processes it, and outputs results. No indicators of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. Usage of third-party libraries is benign. No obfuscated code or suspicious control flow detected. Potential concerns could include unvalidated input handling, but no unsafe operations like SQL injection or code injection are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code seems to perform typical data processing tasks with no suspicious activity observed.",
