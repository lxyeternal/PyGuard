  "purpose": "Import the Haikunator class from a local module, likely for name or token generation.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports a class without data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, with no data processing, network activity, or malicious payloads. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the minimal and standard nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
