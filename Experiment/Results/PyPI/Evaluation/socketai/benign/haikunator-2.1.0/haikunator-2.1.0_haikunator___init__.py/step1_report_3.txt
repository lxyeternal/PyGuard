  "purpose": "Import the Haikunator class from the local haikunator module, likely for generating random or human-readable names.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Haikunator from a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; code only performs an import operation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module, which is a common pattern in Python projects. There are no embedded payloads, data leaks, or suspicious behavior present. No external inputs, outputs, or execution flows are demonstrated beyond the import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger module and is benign in isolation.",
