{
  "purpose": "Import the Haikunator class from the haikunator module, likely used for generating random or pronounceable names.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing the 'haikunator' module, specifically the Haikunator class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment contains a single import statement from a relative module. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no potentially dangerous operations. It appears to be part of a larger package where 'haikunator' provides functionality for name generation. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Due to its simplicity, there's limited scope for malicious intent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal part of a larger codebase likely used for generating random names.",
