  "purpose": "Import the Haikunator class from the local haikunator module, likely for generating random or human-readable names.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'haikunator'. No external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks observed; no untrusted data processing or output shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only a module import is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing the Haikunator class from a local module. This is a standard practice for code organization and does not in itself indicate malicious behavior. No input/output, network activity, or other suspicious operations are present. Given the minimal code snippet, there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to serve the purpose of utilizing the Haikunator class in the larger application without any security concerns from this snippet.",
