{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'haikunator', used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads static metadata such as package name, author, email, description, license, version, URL, packages, test suite, and classifiers from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process user input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The script simply assigns static metadata to variables and passes them to the setup() function; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code is a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package configuration, defines classifiers, and calls setup() with static package metadata. It does not include any code that reads user input, executes untrusted data, or performs network operations. The code structure follows standard Python packaging practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves its intended purpose of configuring package metadata safely.",
