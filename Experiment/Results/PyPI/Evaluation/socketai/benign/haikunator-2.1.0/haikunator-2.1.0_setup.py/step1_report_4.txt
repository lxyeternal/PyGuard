  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated elements or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setuptools setup configuration defining package metadata, classifiers, and package inclusion. It contains no external input handling, no network calls, and no dynamic code execution. All data is hardcoded and static, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage. The purpose is solely to package the 'haikunator' library for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
