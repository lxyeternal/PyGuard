  "purpose": "Generate human-readable, random descriptive names using default or custom lists, optionally seeded for reproducibility.",
  "sources": "Reads from internal lists (_adjectives, _nouns) and optional user-provided lists; uses Random.seed if provided.",
  "sinks": "Uses random.choice on lists; constructs strings for output; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source: internal lists or user input -> random.choice -> string concatenation -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured utility for generating random descriptive names. It relies solely on standard libraries and internal or user-supplied lists. No external network, file, or environment variable access occurs. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of random.choice is standard, and the code does not perform any dynamic code execution or hidden operations. The only potential concern is that custom lists could contain malicious content if supplied by a user, but this is outside static analysis scope. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward random name generator with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing security scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate; however, given the static analysis, the risk score can be confidently lowered to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.",
