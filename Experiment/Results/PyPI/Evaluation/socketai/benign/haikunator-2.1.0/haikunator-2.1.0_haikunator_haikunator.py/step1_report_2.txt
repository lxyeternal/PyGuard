{
  "purpose": "This code generates random, human-readable names similar to Heroku app names by combining adjectives, nouns, and random tokens.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters in the constructor (__init__) and the haikunate method (such as seed, delimiter, token length, token type, and custom word lists). Uses the random choice method for selecting elements.",
  "sinks": "Uses the random.choice method internally for selecting adjectives, nouns, and token characters. No external data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (seed, custom lists, token parameters) flow into the constructor and haikunate method, affecting random selection. Random choice functions select elements from predefined lists or input characters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The use of standard libraries (random) and straightforward string operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for generating random names using static lists of adjectives and nouns, with options for customization. The randomness is seeded via the 'seed' parameter for reproducibility. The core function combines randomly selected elements into a formatted string. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious code appear. The code uses standard Python practices for randomness and string handling, with no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, purpose-built for generating human-readable random names. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this implementation.",
