  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward random name generator with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing security scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate; however, given the static analysis, the risk score can be confidently lowered to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0."
