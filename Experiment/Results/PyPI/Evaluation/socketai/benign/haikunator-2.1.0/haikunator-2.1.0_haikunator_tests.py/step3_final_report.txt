  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Haikunator string generator library, verifying output patterns, seed reproducibility, and customization options.",
  "sources": "Local function calls to haikunate() with various parameters; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on generated strings; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to haikunate() leading to string output assertions; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward test suite.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of string output formats, randomness, and reproducibility. It does not perform any network communication, file operations, or code injection. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is well-structured, clear, and uses common testing practices. No anomalies or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for the Haikunator library with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are all appropriately zero.",
