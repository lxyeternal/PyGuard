{
  "purpose": "Provides various base encoding and decoding utilities, including base16, base32, base64, and identity conversions, primarily for data transformation tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters and internal byte streams during encoding and decoding processes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs encoded or decoded byte data; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding/decoding functions, involving byte conversions, chunking, and string formatting, without external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of unimplemented methods (`NotImplementedError`) in abstract base class; no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard encoding schemes with straightforward logic, utilizing common Python libraries and practices. No external network calls, obfuscation techniques, or suspicious patterns are present. The incomplete methods are typical for abstract classes and do not indicate malicious intent. External dependencies (`baseconv`, `morphys`) are assumed benign based on context. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of data encoding utilities with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
