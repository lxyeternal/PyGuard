  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import core functions for the 'py-multibase' library.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement for functions and classes from .multibase",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data handling or external data flows present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of package metadata and an import statement for module functions and constants. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package info and imports functions for use elsewhere.",
