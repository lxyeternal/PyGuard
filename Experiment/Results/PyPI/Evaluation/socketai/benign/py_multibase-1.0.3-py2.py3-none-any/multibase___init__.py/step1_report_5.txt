{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata and imports functions and classes related to the 'py-multibase' package for encoding and decoding data.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement importing functions and classes from the local module .multibase.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted input or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code only sets metadata and imports functions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains package metadata declarations and a single import statement for functions related to multibase encoding. No data processing, input handling, or system commands are present. The import statement only includes functions and classes; no dynamic code execution or hidden behavior is evident. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It merely sets metadata and imports relevant functions.",
