{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import functions for a multibase encoding library",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__author__, __email__, __version__) and import statement from multibase module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or data output handling present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code only sets metadata and imports functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code establishes package metadata (author, email, version) and imports functions and constants from a local module 'multibase'. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The import statement appears standard, importing encoding and decoding functions. The file is minimal and seems to serve only as a package initializer with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains standard metadata and import statements without any anomalies or malicious code.",
