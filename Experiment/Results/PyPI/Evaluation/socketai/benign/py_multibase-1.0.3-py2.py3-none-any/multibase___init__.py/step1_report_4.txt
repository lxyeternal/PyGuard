{
  "purpose": "Package initialization and metadata declaration for py-multibase, importing core functions and classes.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) and import statement from the local module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially imported functions and classes, but no direct data sink or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are static; the import brings in functions/classes for use within the package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard for Python package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports core functions from the local module 'multibase'. There are no user inputs, environment variable usages, or network calls. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, are present. The structure is typical for a Python package's top-level module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a package initializer with metadata and import statements. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
