{
  "purpose": "This code defines the top-level package for 'py-multibase', providing metadata and importing core functions and classes related to encoding and decoding operations.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement importing functions and classes from the 'multibase' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external outputs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported 'multibase' module functions and classes into potential usage points, but no data flow analysis is evident as this is a static package definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be standard package setup and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initialization script, setting metadata and importing core functionalities. No external input processing, data handling, or suspicious activity is present. The import statement loads specific functions and classes from the 'multibase' module, which are typical for a package providing encoding/decoding capabilities. No code injection, network activity, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and imports functions from a local module, indicating no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
