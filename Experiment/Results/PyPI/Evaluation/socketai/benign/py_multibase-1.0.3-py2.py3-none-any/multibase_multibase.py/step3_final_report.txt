{
  "purpose": "Provides multibase encoding and decoding functions supporting various encoding schemes with static lookup tables and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data in 'ensure_bytes' normalization, uses external libraries 'morphys' and 'converters' for encoding conversions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is normalized, encoding type is looked up, data is encoded or decoded via converters, with error handling for unsupported encodings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of multibase encoding/decoding, with static lookup tables, proper error handling, and no dynamic code execution or network activity. External dependencies are assumed safe. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The data flow is transparent, and the functions perform expected operations without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs its intended encoding functions without security issues or malicious intent. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.1) are justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
