{
  "purpose": "This code provides encoding and decoding functions for various multibase encoding schemes, supporting encoding detection and conversion between data formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data in functions like encode, get_codec, is_encoded, and decode, primarily from parameters passed to these functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data returned by encode and decode functions, which could be used downstream in an application.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to encode/decode functions, where data is processed, encoded, or decoded based on the specified encoding. The encode function prepends encoding identifier, and decode extracts and interprets data accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution detected. The code utilizes known libraries and standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to encoding/decoding using predefined schemes, with proper error handling for unsupported encodings. It uses a lookup dictionary for efficiency and clear functions for each operation. No indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities are observed. Usage of 'ensure_bytes' from an external module appears to be for data normalization, which is standard. The code's logic is straightforward and adheres to common encoding/decoding patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of multibase encoding and decoding functions with no malicious behavior detected. It adheres to best practices for encoding handling and error management. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
