{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode, decode, and identify multibase encoded data using various encoding schemes.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (encoding name, data to encode/decode). Uses ensure_bytes to process data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include the encode, decode, and get_codec functions where data is processed and transformed; if external or untrusted data is passed, improper handling could lead to issues, but not necessarily malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed into encode/decode functions -> ensure_bytes processes data -> get_codec identifies encoding -> encode/decode performs conversion -> data is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of ensure_bytes is standard. Lookup tables are static and defined at startup.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly manages encoding schemes, mapping encoding names and codes to converter objects. No suspicious code or behaviors detected. Functions perform straightforward encoding and decoding operations. No external network interactions, no data leakage or insecure operations are present. The code appears to be a well-structured utility module for multibase encoding. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for multibase encoding/decoding with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs its intended functionality securely and transparently.",
