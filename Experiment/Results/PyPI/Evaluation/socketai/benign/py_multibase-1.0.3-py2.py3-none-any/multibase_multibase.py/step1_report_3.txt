{
  "purpose": "This code implements multibase encoding and decoding functions supporting various encoding schemes.",
  "sources": "Input data for encoding/decoding (parameters 'data' and 'encoding'), data slices for determining codec.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by encode and decode functions; potential data leakage if misused, but no external sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data -> ensure_bytes -> get_codec -> encode/decode -> output; encoding string lookup for encode.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no network activity or file system access; no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides encoding and decoding functionalities for multiple base encodings using a lookup table. The functions process input data through standard conversions, with proper error handling for unsupported encodings. No external system calls, network activity, or access to sensitive data are observed. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of external libraries appears safe and focused on encoding tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of multibase encoding schemes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe for use, with proper handling of supported encodings and conversions.",
