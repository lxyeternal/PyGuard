{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for encoding and decoding data using various multibase encoding schemes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: 'data' for get_codec, is_encoded, decode, and 'encoding' for encode.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed and returned by encoding/decoding functions; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments into ensure_bytes conversions, then into encoding lookup and conversion functions, finally returning encoded or decoded data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of third-party library 'morphys' for ensure_bytes is noted but not suspicious. The encoding scheme is standard. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple multibase encoding schemes with associated converters. It provides functions to encode data, determine encoding from data, check if data is encoded, and decode data. The functions rely on 'ensure_bytes' for data normalization and a lookup table for encoding schemes. Error handling is straightforward with ValueError exceptions for unsupported encodings. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or system manipulation, is evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose for encoding/decoding data with various schemes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of multibase encoding and decoding functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs common patterns and relies on external, reputable libraries for byte handling. Overall, it appears safe and purposeful.",
