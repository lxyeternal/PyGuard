{
  "purpose": "Provides a safe, extensible templating environment with error handling, input sanitization, and secure file loading.",
  "sources": "Template strings, environment variables, file system via load_from_path, user input during rendering and evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Rendered output, evaluated expressions, file reads, error information properties.",
  "flows": "User input or template names flow into rendering/evaluation functions; file paths are validated before reading; error info propagates through properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Path validation prevents directory traversal.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard safe practices: exception handling via handle_panic, path sanitization in load_from_path, safe string marking, and use of external libraries for escaping. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The dynamic attribute setting and flexible input handling are typical for such environments and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal inherent risks, primarily related to potential misuse with untrusted input, which is standard for templating engines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, secure, and benign implementation of a Python templating environment. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are evident. The assessment scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
