  "purpose": "This code provides a mini template rendering environment with functions for handling templates, evaluating expressions, and managing errors, primarily for safe HTML rendering and template management.",
  "sources": "Input sources include string inputs to functions like render_str, eval_expr, load_from_path, and external data from the environment or filters. Data is read from file paths in load_from_path, environment configurations, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string rendering, expression evaluation, and file reading. The code does not perform dangerous system calls or network operations, but unsafe use of user input in templates could lead to code injection if the templates are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input functions (render_str, eval_expr, load_from_path) through the environment and template processing functions, into rendering and evaluation steps, possibly involving untrusted input into templates. No explicit unsafe flows or external data exfiltration is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code is structured for template rendering with proper exception handling, and no obfuscated or unusual language features are present. The use of dynamic attribute setting in __init__ appears standard. The loader function in load_from_path restricts directory traversal, which is good. No suspicious behavior in error handling or imports.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a templating environment with functions for rendering strings and evaluating expressions, including custom error handling with TemplateError. It carefully manages environment configurations, supports safe string marking, and loads templates from paths with directory traversal protections. The handle_panic decorator wraps rendering functions to catch specific low-level panics, raising them as TemplateErrors. The code imports and uses standard libraries, with fallback for escape functions. No malicious or suspicious logic such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident. All functions appear to serve their documented purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured template rendering environment with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It emphasizes safety in template loading and rendering, with appropriate error handling. No malware or security risks are identified within this module.",
