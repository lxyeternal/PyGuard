  "purpose": "Utility functions for error creation and marking data as safe in a Rust-Python binding context.",
  "sources": "The 'info' parameter passed to make_error, and the imported 'safe' module/function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data into dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "The 'info' object flows into the creation of a TemplateError; 'safe' is assigned to mark_safe for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward utility code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple error utility function and a marker for safe data. It does not process untrusted data into system or network sinks, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The 'info' parameter is used only internally to create an error object, and 'safe' is a utility marker. No security issues or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for error handling and data safety marking in a Rust-Python context. It poses no security risks or malware concerns. The scores are appropriate and require no adjustment.",
