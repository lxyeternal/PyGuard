{
  "purpose": "Defines utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe within a Rust-Python integration module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'info' parameter in make_error function and imports from the current package.",
  "sinks": "The make_error function creates a TemplateError object, which could potentially be used in error propagation, but no external untrusted data is directly used in a malicious way.",
  "flows": "The info parameter flows into the TemplateError constructor, but no external input or untrusted data sources are shown. The safe function is assigned to mark_safe, but without further context, its behavior is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward utility code with clear intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function make_error that constructs a TemplateError object using info.description. It assigns safe to mark_safe, which is used by the rust runtime. There is no indication of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be part of a binding layer, facilitating error creation and data marking between Python and Rust, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module for error handling and data marking with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of a larger binding system and does not process untrusted data in a harmful way.",
