  "purpose": "Define utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe for Rust bindings.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'info' parameter passed to 'make_error' and imports modules/functions from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data is written or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "The 'info' parameter flows into 'TemplateError' creation; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; the code appears to serve straightforward error handling and marking functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create an error object using information passed in, and assigns a 'safe' marker from an imported module. No external data sources or outputs are involved. The functions are utility in nature, and do not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple utility module for error creation and marking data as safe. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and secure.",
