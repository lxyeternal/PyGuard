{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe within a Rust-Python binding module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'info' parameter in make_error and imports from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data directly into any dangerous sinks such as network, filesystem, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The 'info' parameter flows into the creation of a TemplateError object; 'safe' is assigned to mark_safe but is not executed with untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function 'make_error' that creates a TemplateError with provided info.description and attaches info to it. It also assigns 'safe' to 'mark_safe'. Both functions are simple and appear to serve as utility helpers for error handling and marking data as safe. There are no inputs processed in a manner that could lead to injection, no external data read beyond parameters, and no suspicious or malicious code operations. The imports and function definitions are standard. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module providing error creation and marking functions for a Rust extension. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
