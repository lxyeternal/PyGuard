{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe within a Rust-Python binding context.",
  "sources": "Input data is indirectly referenced via the 'info' parameter in make_error; no direct external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions process or output untrusted data directly; 'TemplateError' instantiation and 'safe' marking are standard practices.",
  "flows": "Input 'info' flows into 'TemplateError' creation but is contained within the error object; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for error creation and marking data as safe for Rust bindings. It imports error handling and safety functions, uses 'info' to generate a TemplateError, and assigns a safety marker. No external input handling, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are simple and serve well-defined purposes without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves a utility role for error handling and data safety marking within a Rust-Python integration. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
