{
  "purpose": "Defines utility functions for error creation and safety marking for Rust bindings.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'info' parameter in make_error function and imports from the local module.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data handling is present; the code only creates objects and assigns attributes.",
  "flows": "Input 'info' flows into the creation of TemplateError, but is confined within function scope; no external data flow or output manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears straightforward and limited to internal utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal components, defines make_error which creates a TemplateError with provided description, and assigns a 'safe' marker to mark_safe. It performs simple object creation and attribute assignment without external data processing or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for error handling and safety marking with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
