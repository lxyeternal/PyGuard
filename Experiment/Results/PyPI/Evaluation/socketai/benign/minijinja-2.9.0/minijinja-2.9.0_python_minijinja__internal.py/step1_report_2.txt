{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe within a Rust-Python binding context.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or output occurring.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions are utility wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'make_error' that constructs a TemplateError with provided info, and a variable 'mark_safe' referencing a 'safe' object or function imported from the same module. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications. The code serves as an internal utility layer for error creation and marking data as safe, with no indications of malicious intent or risky behavior. The simplicity and limited scope reduce the likelihood of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for error handling and marking data as safe in a Rust-Python integration context. No malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation are evident.",
