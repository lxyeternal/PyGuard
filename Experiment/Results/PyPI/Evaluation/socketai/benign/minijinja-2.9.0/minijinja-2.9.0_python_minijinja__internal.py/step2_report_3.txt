  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- Defines `make_error(info)` which creates a `TemplateError` with `info.description` and attaches `_info`.\n- Assigns `safe` (imported from the same module) to `mark_safe`.\n- No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The code appears to be utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe in a Rust-Python interface.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions are simple wrappers/utilities, not performing any risky operations.\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Benign utility functions, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Comment:** The security risk score is very low, which aligns with the benign nature. No issues here. The confidence is high.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, very straightforward utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Comment:** Fully benign. No concerns. The security risk score could even be zero, but 0 is acceptable.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no external data or risky operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Comment:** Completely benign. Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Comment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, external modules used, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Comment:** No security risks or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, utility in nature, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as expected.\n- The risk scores are very low or zero, aligning with the benign analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a simple utility module for error creation and marking data as safe, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
