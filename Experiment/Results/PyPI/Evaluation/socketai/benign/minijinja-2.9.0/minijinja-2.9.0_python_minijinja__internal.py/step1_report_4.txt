{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe within a Rust-Python integration module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'info' parameter passed to make_error and uses it to access 'info.description'.",
  "sinks": "The 'err' object with 'err._info' and the 'mark_safe' alias are potential sinks if used improperly, but in this context, they are internal and safe.",
  "flows": "Input 'info' flows through make_error to create a TemplateError, and the 'safe' function is assigned to mark_safe for marking data as safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The functions appear to be straightforward utility helpers with no hidden or unusual code paths.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and defines two functions: 'make_error' creates a TemplateError instance with provided info, and 'mark_safe' is an alias for 'safe'. Both functions are simple, with no external data sources or complex logic. The use of '_info' as an internal attribute does not raise security concerns, and the code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or code execution. The overall structure suggests controlled utility functions for error reporting and safety marking, with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for error handling and marking data as safe in a Rust-Python interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
