{
  "purpose": "Define utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe within a Python module used by Rust bindings.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'info' parameter in make_error function, and the imported modules (.TemplateError, .safe).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data beyond creating an error object and marking data as safe.",
  "flows": "The 'info' object flows into the creation of a TemplateError; 'safe' is assigned to mark_safe for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for error creation and marking data as safe, which are common in Python modules interfacing with Rust. The make_error function creates an error object with provided info but does not perform any risky operations. The 'safe' variable is assigned from an imported function or variable, likely a safe utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward and purpose-driven, with no suspicious constructs or activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and standard for interfacing between Python and Rust, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
