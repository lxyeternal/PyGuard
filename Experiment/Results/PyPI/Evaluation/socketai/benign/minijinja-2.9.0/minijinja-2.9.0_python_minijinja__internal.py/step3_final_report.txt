  "purpose": "Utility functions for error creation and marking data as safe in a Rust-Python interface.",
  "sources": "The 'info' parameter in make_error() providing description; the imported 'safe' module element.",
  "sinks": "The creation of TemplateError objects and assignment to mark_safe, which could influence error handling and data marking.",
  "flows": "Input 'info' flows into TemplateError constructor; 'safe' is assigned to mark_safe, but no external data or untrusted sources are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe, with no external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The make_error() function creates an error object from provided info, and mark_safe is assigned from an imported module element. No risky operations or malicious behavior are present. The code's scope is limited and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for error creation and data marking, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
