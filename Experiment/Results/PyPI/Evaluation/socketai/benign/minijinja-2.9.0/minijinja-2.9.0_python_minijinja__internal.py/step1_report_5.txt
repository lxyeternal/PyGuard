{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe within a Rust-Python binding context.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input; uses internal objects and modules.",
  "sinks": "None evident where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; functions operate on internal objects.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward, with no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; the 'safe' function's behavior is external and not shown.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function to create a custom error object, associating extra info, and assigns a function 'safe' from an imported module to 'mark_safe'. It relies on external modules ('TemplateError' and 'safe') but does not perform any data processing or external communication. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The only potential concern is the external 'safe' function, but its mere assignment does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to serve utility purposes without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks are evident from this fragment.",
