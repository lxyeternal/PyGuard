{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for error handling and marking data as safe within a Rust-Python integration module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'info' object passed to make_error function.",
  "sinks": "The 'err' object created by make_error, and the 'mark_safe' function which marks data as safe.",
  "flows": "Input 'info' flows into 'make_error', which creates an error object; 'safe' is assigned to 'mark_safe' for marking data as safe.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, and the functions are straightforward. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function 'make_error' that creates a TemplateError instance using information from an 'info' object, which includes a description and potentially other metadata. It also assigns 'safe' to 'mark_safe', indicating a marking function used in the rust module to denote safe data. There are no external data sources, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard utility code facilitating error handling and safety marking in a Rust-Python interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as utility functions for error creation and marking data as safe. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
