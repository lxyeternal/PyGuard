  "purpose": "Render a simple HTML page using in-memory templates with static data.",
  "sources": "Static template strings and provided data dictionaries (page and items).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Templates extend layout; data variables ('page', 'items') are interpolated during rendering; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard template syntax, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a minijinja Environment with in-memory templates, extending a layout and rendering with static data. No external data sources, network calls, or code execution occurs. Templates use standard syntax with variable interpolation and looping. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The data is static and controlled, with no user input or external dependencies. The rendering process is straightforward and safe, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of template rendering with static data. All signals indicate no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment and templates are used in a standard manner, with no external or untrusted data involved. The security assessment scores are appropriately zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk categories.",
