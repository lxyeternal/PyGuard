  "purpose": "Render HTML templates using MiniJinja with provided context data for web page generation.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'page' dictionary and 'items' list passed to the render_template method.",
  "sinks": "Template rendering process outputs HTML to standard output; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Data from 'page' and 'items' are injected into templates, resulting in HTML output; no external data sources or untrusted input handling is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Usage of MiniJinja appears straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a MiniJinja environment with in-memory templates 'index.html' and 'layout.html'. It renders 'index.html' with a 'page' object and 'items' list, producing a simple HTML page. No external network connections, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution are present. The templating is basic and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard templating example for rendering HTML pages with provided data. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The implementation appears safe and intended solely for rendering HTML content.",
