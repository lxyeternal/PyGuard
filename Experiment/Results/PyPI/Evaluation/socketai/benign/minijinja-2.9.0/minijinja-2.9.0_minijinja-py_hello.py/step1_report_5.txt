  "purpose": "Render an HTML template using the minijinja templating engine with provided data.",
  "sources": "Input data: page dictionary with title, items list; Template strings for index and layout HTML files.",
  "sinks": "Rendering environment which processes templates with data; output via print statement.",
  "flows": "Input data -> env.render_template() -> template rendering process -> output via print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code observed. The code uses safe template rendering. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines HTML templates using minijinja, sets up a rendering environment with these templates, and renders a page with a title and list items. No external data fetching, no code injection, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The use of templates is standard, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The environment object is straightforward, and the rendering process appears typical for a templating engine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of rendering HTML templates with static data using minijinja. No malicious intent, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are identified.",
