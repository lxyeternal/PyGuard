  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, containing no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "sources": "Assignment of configuration variables, list definitions, comments, and static paths within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or produce output affecting system security.",
  "flows": "The code is purely declarative; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; the code is straightforward and standard for documentation configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It contains only variable assignments, list definitions, and comments. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
