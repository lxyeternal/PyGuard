  "purpose": "Utility functions for comparing and converting version strings, and a class for parsing and evaluating version predicates.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: version strings, predicate strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data to perform actions or leaks; functions only perform data validation, conversion, and comparison.",
  "flows": "Input version strings or predicate strings are parsed and processed internally; no external or untrusted data flows to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic; code is straightforward, performing version comparisons and conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for version handling, including conversion between strings, tuples, and integers, as well as a class to evaluate version constraints. It uses standard libraries and regex for parsing, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or external communications are present. The only potential concern is the regex used to strip suffixes from version strings, but it is benign and standard for version parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of version comparison utilities with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be safe, primarily used for version management in package dependencies.",
