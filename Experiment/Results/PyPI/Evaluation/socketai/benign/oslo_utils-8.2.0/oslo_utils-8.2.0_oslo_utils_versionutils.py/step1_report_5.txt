  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for comparing, converting, and parsing software version strings and predicates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'requested_version', 'current_version', 'version', 'version_int', and 'predicate_str'.",
  "sinks": "Comparison operations (e.g., >=, <=, >, <, !=, ==) and regex parsing functions that process version strings and predicates.",
  "flows": "Input version strings or predicates are parsed and converted; then they are compared or evaluated against other version data using comparison functions or predicate satisfaction methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Use of standard libraries and straightforward version comparisons; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for version string conversions, comparisons, and predicate parsing. It uses standard libraries (packaging.version, re, operator) with proper exception handling. No signs of malicious payload, external data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The regex removes suffixes like 'a', 'alpha', 'b', 'beta', 'rc' from version strings to normalize them. The version comparison and predicate logic are typical for package version management. No evidence of malicious activity or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for version management with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and consistent with normal version comparison functionalities.",
