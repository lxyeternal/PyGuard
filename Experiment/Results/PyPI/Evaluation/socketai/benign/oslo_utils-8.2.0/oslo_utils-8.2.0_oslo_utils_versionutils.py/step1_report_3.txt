  "purpose": "Helper functions for comparing and converting software version strings, including compatibility checks and predicate parsing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (requested_version, current_version, version, version_str, predicate_str).",
  "sinks": "Conversions and comparisons may process untrusted version strings; no direct data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input version strings are parsed, compared, and converted within functions, with no external data transmission or harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes regex to strip pre-release identifiers, which is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscation or malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides version comparison utilities using the packaging.version module, converting versions between strings, tuples, and integers, and parsing version predicates. All functions rely on standard libraries and straightforward parsing. There are no indications of malicious logic, backdoors, or malicious side-effects. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification code is present. The regex and conversion functions are typical for version handling. The overall structure and implementation are consistent with open-source version utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured utility for version handling with no malicious intent or security risks. It processes input data for version comparisons and conversions safely without suspicious behaviors.",
