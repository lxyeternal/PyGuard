  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' and configuring 'setuptools.setup()' with 'setup_requires' and 'pbr' parameters. It contains licensing comments but no runtime data input, external communication, or suspicious behavior. The code follows typical packaging conventions without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
