  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools and pbr.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools, reads setup parameters and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static configuration is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that uses setuptools and pbr for package management. It imports only well-known libraries and executes a typical setup call with specified requirements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to be standard, safe, and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It is typical for open-source Python packages and does not pose a security risk.",
