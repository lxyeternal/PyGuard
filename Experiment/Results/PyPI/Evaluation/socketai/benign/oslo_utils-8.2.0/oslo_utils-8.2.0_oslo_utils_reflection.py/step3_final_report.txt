  "purpose": "A reflection utility module providing introspection functions for Python objects, classes, and callables.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmembers, inspect.signature, object attributes (__module__, __name__, __qualname__, __self__, __class__, __mro__)",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Inspection functions retrieve metadata from objects, classes, and functions; no external data flows or code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard Python introspection, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard reflection utility relying on Python's inspect and types modules. It provides functions for obtaining object members, class names, callable names, method self, argument signatures, subclass checks, and comparison of callbacks. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network or file I/O, or execute dynamic code. The use of deprecated attributes like types.TypeType is for compatibility but not malicious. The functions serve legitimate debugging and introspection purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: 0.0–0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard reflection utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its safety, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
