  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a reflection utility module, relying solely on Python's built-in introspection libraries (`inspect`, `operator`, `types`, etc.).\n- No input from untrusted sources, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution are present.\n- The functions are standard and serve typical debugging or introspection purposes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- Compatibility with Python 2 and 3 is handled, but this does not introduce malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Confirmation:\n- **Are any issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is a benign reflection utility with no malicious intent.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Are there any flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports consistently identify the code as standard, safe, and benign. They correctly note the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  The scores are low (mostly 0.0 or 0.1), which aligns with the assessment that this code is safe.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- Some reports mention the use of deprecated or version-specific attributes (e.g., `types.TypeType`), but this is standard for compatibility and not malicious.\n- No claims or evidence suggest that the code could be exploited or used maliciously when used as intended.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, the code is a standard reflection utility module with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, utility nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and serves legitimate purposes. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
