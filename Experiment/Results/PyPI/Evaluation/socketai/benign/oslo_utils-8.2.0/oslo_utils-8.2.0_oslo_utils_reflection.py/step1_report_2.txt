{
  "purpose": "The code provides reflection utilities for inspecting Python objects, classes, methods, and functions, including retrieving member information, class names, callable names, and argument signatures.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmembers, inspect.signature, inspect.isfunction, inspect.ismethod, type attributes, and object attributes such as __module__, __name__, __qualname__, __self__.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not write or execute untrusted data directly, nor does it perform network operations or file manipulations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the functions are primarily for introspection and metadata extraction, with no evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for reflection utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a reflection utility module that relies on standard Python introspection features to inspect objects, classes, and functions. It includes functions to get members, class names, callable names, method self-references, and argument signatures. No untrusted input handling, network operations, or file manipulations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code is well-structured, uses common patterns, and does not appear obfuscated or intentionally malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard reflection utility with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be used maliciously, and there are no malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities detected.",
