{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for reflection, introspection, and handling Python object metadata, such as getting members, class names, callable names, and argument signatures.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmembers, inspect.signature, object attributes (__module__, __name__, __qualname__, __self__)",
  "sinks": "None evident. No direct use of untrusted input leading to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears standard and well-structured for reflection purposes.",
  "analysis": "The module relies solely on Python's built-in reflection and inspection libraries to retrieve metadata about objects, functions, and classes. There are no inputs processed from untrusted sources, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution. The code handles Python 2 and 3 compatibility but does not contain any code that could be leveraged for malicious purposes or data exfiltration. It does include mechanisms for introspecting class and function metadata, which could potentially be used in an attack if combined with malicious input, but the code itself does not perform such actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard reflection utility module with no malicious intent or behavior. It does not contain backdoors, malicious data leaks, or obfuscated malicious code. It is safe and appears to serve legitimate introspection purposes.",
