{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for reflection, inspecting objects, retrieving class names, member functions, and callable signatures.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmembers, inspect.signature, get_method_self, and attribute access to object properties.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. No untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from object attributes and functions flows through inspection functions without external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code relies solely on standard reflection and inspection methods. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python reflection utilities using the 'inspect' module to obtain class names, member lists, method signatures, and callable names. It includes helper functions to determine method types, subclass relationships, and argument extraction. There are no network calls, file operations, or external data transfers. No embedded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. The functions serve benign purposes for introspection within Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of legitimate reflection utilities aimed at inspecting objects, classes, and functions. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. It is safe and primarily used for debugging or introspection tasks.",
