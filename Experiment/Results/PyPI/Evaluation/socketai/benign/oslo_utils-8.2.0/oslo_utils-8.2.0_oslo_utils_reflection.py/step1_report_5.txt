{
  "purpose": "This module provides reflection utilities for inspecting Python objects, functions, classes, and methods, including retrieving members, class names, callable names, and argument signatures.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmembers, inspect.signature, get_method_self, inspect.isfunction, inspect.ismethod, inspect.isclass",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code only performs introspection and does not write or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code gathers data from objects (sources), analyzes their attributes and signatures, and returns information without executing or transmitting untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deprecated or version-specific attributes like types.TypeType (Python 2), but this is standard for compatibility and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs introspection and reflection on objects, classes, functions, and methods, mainly using the inspect module. It includes functions for retrieving member information, class names, callable signatures, and method self references. It carefully handles different Python versions and object types. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The purpose appears to be utility-based reflection without malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected, and the code’s behavior is consistent with standard introspection utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a reflection utility module intended for inspecting Python objects and functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be well-structured, compatible with multiple Python versions, and solely focused on introspection tasks.",
