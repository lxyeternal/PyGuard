  "purpose": "Utility functions for file and directory management, checksum computation, and file type detection.",
  "sources": "Reads from filesystem in functions like ensure_tree, delete_if_exists, write_to_tempfile, compute_file_checksum, last_bytes, is_json, is_yaml.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to filesystem, creates temporary files, deletes files, and reads files. No network or sensitive data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "File content is read in compute_file_checksum, is_json, is_yaml; data written in write_to_tempfile; files deleted in delete_if_exists; directory structures created in ensure_tree.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Functions are standard utilities. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides common filesystem utilities including directory creation, file deletion, checksum calculation, and file type detection (JSON/YAML). Usage of standard modules like os, hashlib, tempfile, json, and yaml. No external network access, no dynamic code execution, no sensitive data handling or exfiltration identified. Functions operate on filesystem objects with expected behavior. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of utility functions for file handling and checksum calculation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is consistent with legitimate system management tasks.",
