{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for file and directory operations, including creating directories, deleting files, working with temporary files, computing checksums, and detecting file formats (JSON/YAML).",
  "sources": "Input data is read from files via open() calls, such as in is_json(), is_yaml(), compute_file_checksum(), and last_bytes().",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be leaked if checksum or file content is exposed, but the code itself does not send data externally or store secrets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (sources) into functions for validation, checksum, or content extraction, with no external or untrusted data sinks apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The code does contain a sleep() call within checksum computation, which is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscation or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides common file utility functions with proper exception handling and security-conscious practices like safe file reading and checksum calculation. The sleep() in compute_file_checksum may be unconventional but does not indicate malicious intent. The functions for detecting JSON/YAML are straightforward and safe. No external network activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to serve legitimate utility purposes without malicious payloads or malicious behavior patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard, legitimate utility functions for handling files and directories, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is very low.",
