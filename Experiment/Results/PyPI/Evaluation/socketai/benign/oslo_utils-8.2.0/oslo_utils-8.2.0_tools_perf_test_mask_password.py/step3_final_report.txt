  "purpose": "Performance testing for password masking and sanitization using regex patterns and strutils functions.",
  "sources": "Reading payload from static file 'large_json_payload.txt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; regex substitution and masking functions operate on static input.",
  "flows": "Input payload -> regex pattern matching and substitution -> strutils.mask_password() call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal/private variable '_SANITIZE_PATTERNS_2' and dynamic code strings in timeit.Timer; missing explicit 'import re' in one report.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a large static payload, applies regex-based sanitization patterns from internal variables, and calls a masking function. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Use of internal variables and dynamic code strings pose minimal risk given static input. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The primary concern is maintainability and correctness, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign performance testing utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of internal variables and dynamic code strings is noted but does not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is very low.",
