  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for string manipulation, validation, and security masking.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Input from parameters, masking sensitive data in logs/messages.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; functions are standard.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard security utility code. Masking functions are typical, with regex patterns for secret masking.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware, low risk.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, due to standard utility functions)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions for handling strings, encoding, masking, conversions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Reads configuration, environment variables, masks secrets.\n- **Anomalies:** Regex patterns for masking are extensive but standard.\n- **Analysis:** No network or malicious behavior; functions are security best practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility library, no malicious intent.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for validation, parsing, masking.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** User input, environment, data masking, validation.\n- **Anomalies:** Regex for masking secrets, no hardcoded credentials, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard sanitization functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, security-focused utility code.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Data validation, masking, string manipulation.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Input parameters, regex masking.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Functions are typical for secure data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, benign utility functions.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for parsing, masking, validation.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Input data, masking sensitive info.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; extensive but standard regex patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, security-oriented code, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard security utility code.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (fully benign)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The functions are standard utility functions for data validation and masking.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, given the benign nature of the code and absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (standard utility functions with minimal security risk, primarily due to regex masking patterns which are common and safe)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of open-source utility functions focused on data validation, string normalization, and security masking. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The functions are implemented following best practices and serve to enhance security hygiene.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or detailed reasoning is needed.",
