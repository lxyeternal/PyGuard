  "purpose": "Provides system-level utilities and helper functions for handling strings, encoding, security masking, conversions, and path manipulations in OpenStack-related projects.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration strings, environment variables, input data, and dictionary keys. Uses regex patterns to identify sensitive data.",
  "sinks": "Masks sensitive information in log messages, dictionary data, and strings; raises exceptions for invalid input; performs conversions and validations.",
  "flows": "Reads data from input parameters (e.g., strings, dictionaries), processes and masks sensitive keys and values, and returns sanitized data or raises exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive regex patterns for masking secrets, but no direct network or file access; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily offers utility functions for data validation, string manipulation, secret masking, and safe conversions. It uses regex patterns for identifying secrets based on common key names. No network activity, file access, or malicious code behavior is present. The functions handle sensitive data masking securely and are consistent with security best practices. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are evident. The use of regex patterns for secret masking is standard and not malicious. No malware-like behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate utility library intended for security and data handling purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It follows expected practices for secret masking and input validation. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
