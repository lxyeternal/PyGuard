  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, validation, security masking, and data parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, regex patterns applied to messages and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Masked output in logs/messages, validation exceptions, regex substitutions in messages and dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Input data → validation/masking functions → output with sensitive info masked or validated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Regex patterns are standard for secret masking.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured utility functions for data validation, string normalization, and secret masking. Regex patterns are static and designed for common secret keys. No dynamic code execution, network access, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are typical for security-focused utility modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The masking functions could be misused if environment is compromised, but that is a general risk of such utilities, not specific to this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for data validation and security masking. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk is evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent and appropriate.",
