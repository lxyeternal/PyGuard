  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic Python script potentially designed for some data processing or utility task.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files, depending on specific lines that access user input, environment variables, or file reads.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can reach network calls, system commands, or database queries if the code uses eval, exec, or unsafe SQL execution. Specific sinks are not identified without seeing actual functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like system commands or network transmissions, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code detected. Watch for unusual dynamic code execution or data leaks, but none evident from the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain obvious malicious patterns. It uses standard Python features and libraries. Without seeing actual implementation details, no malicious behavior is detected. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining are present. The structure appears typical for a utility script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies detected.",
