{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code that reads environment variables, network communication functions, and data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, environment variables, file operations, and data outputs that could leak information or be exploited.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or network data flow into processing functions, with potential outputs to network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; no malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting low but present residual risk typical for scripts handling environment variables or network communication. Confidence levels are justified based on the thoroughness of the review and the limited code context.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately assess the code as benign with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering potential inherent risks in network or environment variable handling. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
