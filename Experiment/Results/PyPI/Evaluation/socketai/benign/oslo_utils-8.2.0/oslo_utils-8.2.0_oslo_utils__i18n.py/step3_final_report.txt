  "purpose": "This code initializes internationalization support using oslo_i18n by creating a TranslatorFactory and defining a primary translation function.",
  "sources": "Import of oslo_i18n module, creation of TranslatorFactory, assignment of primary translation function _",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform I/O operations",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as no runtime data processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for its purpose",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup for oslo_i18n internationalization, importing the library, creating a TranslatorFactory with a specific domain, and defining a translation function. There are no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The reports indicate 'Empty response' with no raw data, which do not relate to this static code snippet. The code is benign, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and does not contain any malicious or security issues. The reports lack detailed evidence of problems. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0.",
