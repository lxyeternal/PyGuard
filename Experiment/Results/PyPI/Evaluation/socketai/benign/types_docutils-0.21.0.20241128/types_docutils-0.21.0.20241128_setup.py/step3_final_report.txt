  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'types-docutils' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining package metadata, URLs, and package data; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script that defines package metadata, URLs, dependencies, and package data. It does not perform any dynamic operations, input handling, or code execution. All data is hardcoded, and there are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The script is purely declarative, serving as configuration for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, aligning with the static and safe nature of the code.",
