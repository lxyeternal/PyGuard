{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the Python package 'types-docutils', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings, variables, and package data; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or sensitive information; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code primarily defines package metadata and data structures without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data statically. It contains no external input handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. All data are static strings and data structures, which is typical for package setup files. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears to be a standard package setup file with no indicators of malicious intent.",
