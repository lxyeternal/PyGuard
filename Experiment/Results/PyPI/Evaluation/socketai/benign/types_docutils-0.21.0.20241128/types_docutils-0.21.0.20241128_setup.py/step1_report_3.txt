  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'types-docutils' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Constants and string variables defining package info, such as 'name', 'description', 'long_description', and package data. No external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function installs the package with specified metadata, dependencies, and package data. No untrusted data processing or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. All data appears to be statically defined within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly follows a typical package setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data explicitly. No external inputs, network operations, or code injections are present. All strings are static and serve informational or configuration purposes. The structure and content follow common Python packaging conventions without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for package distribution.",
