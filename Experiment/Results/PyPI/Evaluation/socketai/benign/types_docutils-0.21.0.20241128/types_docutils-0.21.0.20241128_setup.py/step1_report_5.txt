{
  "purpose": "This code is setting up a Python package called 'types-docutils' with metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static variables for package metadata and configuration, such as 'name', 'description', 'long_description', and uses them in the setup() function. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses only predefined parameters and does not involve untrusted data or external inputs. No sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions are detected.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks. All variables are statically defined, and setup() is invoked with these constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code follows standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package metadata through static variables. The setup() call configures package details such as name, version, description, URLs, dependencies, package data, license, Python version requirement, and classifiers. All data appears to be static and derived from known package metadata, with no user input or external data fetching. No suspicious or malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with static configuration and no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
