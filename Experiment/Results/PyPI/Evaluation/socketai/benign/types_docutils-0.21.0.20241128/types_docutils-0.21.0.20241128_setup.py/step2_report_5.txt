  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with static data, no dynamic code execution, and no external inputs. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies. The code appears benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the script is a typical setup configuration with static data, no external input, and no suspicious patterns. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the script.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely a static setup script with no external data, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns, a malware or risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The highest score justified here is 0, indicating no security concern.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly identify the code as benign and do not base their conclusions on assumptions. They rely on static analysis and standard package setup conventions.\n\n6. **Score Consistency and Final Estimation**:  \n   The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- The code is safe.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
