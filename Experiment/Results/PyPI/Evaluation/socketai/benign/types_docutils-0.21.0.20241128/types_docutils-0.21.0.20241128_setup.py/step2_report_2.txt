  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Python package setup script. There are no indications of malicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. The code is static, straightforward, and follows typical packaging conventions. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note that all data is static, no untrusted input is processed, and there are no suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that the script is a typical setup configuration with no security concerns.\n\nGiven the absence of any suspicious activity, the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They focus on the static, well-understood nature of the setup script, correctly concluding that it poses no security risk.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent across all reports and with the detailed analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive and accurate analysis, I concur with the existing scores. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
