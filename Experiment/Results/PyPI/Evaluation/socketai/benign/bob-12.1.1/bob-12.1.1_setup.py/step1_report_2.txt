  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, specifically the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function could potentially perform installation or configuration actions, but no untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; setup() is invoked with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The script is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only setuptools and calls setup() with default parameters, which is a common pattern for Python packaging. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, standard boilerplate, and contains no hidden or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs basic package configuration without any suspicious activity.",
