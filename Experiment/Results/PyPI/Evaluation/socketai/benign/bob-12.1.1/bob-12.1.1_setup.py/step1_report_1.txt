  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project",
  "sources": "No input sources; standard setup() call with no parameters",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "No data flow; the script only invokes setup() with default parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal code, standard use of setuptools setup()",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools module and calls setup() without arguments, which is a standard practice in Python packaging. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The script appears to be a typical setup.py file for packaging a Python module. No data input or output, no potential for code injection, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard packaging script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
