  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distribution of a Python module using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call, which is standard for packaging scripts.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script does not process external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; the script simply invokes 'setup()' with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual constructs, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This code is a minimal, standard setup script for Python packaging. It imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with default parameters, indicating it likely relies on setup.cfg or other configuration files for package details. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or external data sources are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, typical packaging script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
