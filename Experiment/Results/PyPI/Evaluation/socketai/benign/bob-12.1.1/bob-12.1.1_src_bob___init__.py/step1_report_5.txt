{
  "purpose": "Extend the package search path for a namespace package to include additional locations",
  "sources": "The __path__ variable and __name__ identifier used as parameters in extend_path",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code modifies __path__, which influences module import behavior but does not process untrusted input",
  "flows": "The extend_path function modifies __path__ based on its current value and the package name, affecting module resolution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard use of pkgutil.extend_path for namespace package handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from the pkgutil module and uses it to modify the __path__ variable by extending it with additional locations for the namespace package. This is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. No untrusted data sources, no suspicious code, and no malicious intent evident. The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical namespace package path extension without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard and safe.",
