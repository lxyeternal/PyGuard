  "purpose": "Support namespace package extension by extending __path__ with additional resource locations.",
  "sources": "Import of extend_path from pkgutil, usage of __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "extend_path(__path__, __name__) modifies __path__ to include additional directories for package resources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard pattern for namespace packages, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from the standard library's pkgutil module and reassigns __path__ to extend its search locations, enabling namespace package functionality. It is a minimal, well-documented pattern with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process external input, perform network operations, or handle secrets. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard pattern, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with confidence 1. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices support the conclusion that it is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
