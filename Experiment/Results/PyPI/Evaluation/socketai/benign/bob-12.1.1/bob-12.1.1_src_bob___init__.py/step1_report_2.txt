{
  "purpose": "The code extends the package's __path__ attribute to include additional locations for package resources, using the standard library's pkgutil.extend_path method.",
  "sources": "Reads the __path__ and __name__ attributes, which are standard in Python packages.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code only modifies __path__ using extend_path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard library function in a typical way.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from the standard library's pkgutil module and applies it to the __path__ variable, which is a typical pattern for namespace packages. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior indicators. The code appears to be a standard implementation of namespace package extension, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package resource extension using Python's standard library. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior based on the provided snippet.",
