  "purpose": "This code extends the module's package path for dynamic loading or namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __path__ and __name__ to modify __path__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The code reads __path__ and __name__, then updates __path__ with extend_path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of pkgutil.extend_path for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil, then reassigns __path__ using extend_path with the current __path__ and __name__. This pattern is common in namespace packages to extend the package's search path dynamically. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code features are present. The code is minimal and serves a legitimate purpose in package management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for namespace package extension and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
