{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module's search path for package resources using pkgutil's extend_path.",
  "sources": "The code reads the built-in __path__ variable, which is used internally to determine package locations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data streams.",
  "flows": "The flow involves the extension of __path__ using extend_path, which modifies the package resource path internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for packages that support namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil, then reassigns __path__ to include extended package locations, typical in namespace package implementations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. It is a straightforward use of standard library functions to extend package paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a common, benign operation for namespace packages with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
