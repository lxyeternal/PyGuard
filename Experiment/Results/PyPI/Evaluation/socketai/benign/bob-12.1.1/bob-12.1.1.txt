      "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI setup with configuration migration and plugin support. No malicious or obfuscated code is detected. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of plugins, which is external to the code. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low to moderate security risk reflecting plugin trust considerations."
