{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for parsing version strings, retrieving version data, and metadata for the py2neo package, a Python client for Neo4j.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('READTHEDOCS_PROJECT', 'READTHEDOCS_VERSION') and the local 'VERSION' file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to return dictionaries containing package metadata and constructs URLs using string formatting.",
  "flows": "Source: Environment variables and version file -> parse_version_string -> get_version_data -> get_metadata -> output metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The use of environment variables and file reading is typical. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a standard version and metadata utility for a Python package. It safely reads environment variables and files, and processes version strings with regex parsing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code adheres to conventional patterns for package metadata handling without any anomalies or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for package version and metadata management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided content.",
