  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup utility for managing package versioning. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of environment variables for version control is common and not inherently risky, especially in controlled build environments. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and low risk scores, are justified and accurate."
