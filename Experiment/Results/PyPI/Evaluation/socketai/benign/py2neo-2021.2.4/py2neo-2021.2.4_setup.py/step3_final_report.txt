  "purpose": "Manage package versioning and metadata, reading version info from files and environment variables, with compatibility checks and version patching.",
  "sources": "Version file (VERSION_FILE), environment variable 'RELEASE', README file.",
  "sinks": "Writing updated version back to VERSION_FILE.",
  "flows": "Read version from file, optionally override with 'RELEASE' env variable, check compatibility, patch version file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'RELEASE' environment variable for version override, which is standard but could be misused if environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, including version management, compatibility checks, and metadata setup. It reads version info from a file and allows override via an environment variable, then writes back to the version file. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The environment variable usage is typical in release workflows. The code is clear, well-structured, and does not contain any backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup utility for managing package versioning. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of environment variables for version control is common and not inherently risky, especially in controlled build environments. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and low risk scores, are justified and accurate.",
