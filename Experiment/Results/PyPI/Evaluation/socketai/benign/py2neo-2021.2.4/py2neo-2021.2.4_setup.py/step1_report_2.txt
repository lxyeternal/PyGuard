  "purpose": "Setup script for the py2neo package, managing versioning and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from files and environment variables; reads README content.",
  "sinks": "File write operations to VERSION_FILE; reading environment variable 'RELEASE'.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'RELEASE' influences version patching; version files are read and written.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'RELEASE' to patch version dynamically; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No external network or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package setup, version control, and metadata extraction. It reads version info from files and environment variables, performs version compatibility checks, and writes back to a version file. The environment variable 'RELEASE' can influence version patching, which is standard for version management. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity detected. No suspicious external communications or backdoors are present. The code structure and logic are consistent with typical setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with version management logic, not containing malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected package setup tasks safely.",
