      "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup utility for managing package versioning. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of environment variables for version control is common and not inherently risky, especially in controlled build environments. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and low risk scores, are justified and accurate."

The low security risk score reflects potential security considerations with default SSL protocols but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports' scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."

The only concern is the insecure default password, which is a common placeholder and not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the reports. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is suitable for use with proper configuration overrides."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Neo4j query builder with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that predicate expressions and order fields supplied externally are validated or sanitized to prevent injection vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), with a slight increase to 0.3 if external inputs are untrusted."

It employs safe practices for database interactions and maintains clear, readable structure. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external transaction objects and environment security, but no active threats are present."
