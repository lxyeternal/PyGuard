  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities, configuration parsing, and decorators for Python 2 and 3 environments. It appears to be a utility module intended for use in larger projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and third-party modules, configuration file reading methods, and deprecation/wrapper decorators.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data flows, no network or file writing/reading of untrusted input, no data exfiltration or command execution points.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows present; mainly utility functions and compatibility code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard practices for cross-version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on compatibility between Python 2 and 3, providing utility functions for string conversions, configuration parsing, and decorators. It carefully manages imports depending on the Python version. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation of untrusted data, or dynamic code execution. All functions and classes serve standard utility purposes with clear and benign logic. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The overall structure is typical of a compatibility utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign compatibility and utility library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
