  "purpose": "Utility functions for cross-version compatibility, configuration parsing, and deprecated module handling in Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports and fallback mechanisms for modules like configparser, collections, urllib, time, socketserver, and sys.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Internal data handling within utility functions; no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility layers and configuration parsing utilities, employing standard patterns and fallbacks for Python 2 and 3. It does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The use of deprecated modules is for compatibility purposes, not malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk between 0 and 0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module aimed at ensuring compatibility across Python versions. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
