  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for configuration management. There are no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the insecure default password, which is a common placeholder and not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the reports. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is suitable for use with proper configuration overrides."
