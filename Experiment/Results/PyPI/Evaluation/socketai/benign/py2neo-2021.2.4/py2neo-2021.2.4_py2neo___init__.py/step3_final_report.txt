{
  "purpose": "The code manages configuration for a Neo4j client, reading environment variables, parsing URIs, and setting connection parameters. It provides connection profiles and handles environment-based overrides.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_AUTH, NEO4J_SECURE, NEO4J_VERIFY), constructor parameters, URI strings parsed via urlsplit.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of connection attributes (protocol, secure, verify, user, password, address), construction of URI strings, setting of class properties.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and applied; URI strings are parsed and used to set connection parameters; constructor parameters override environment variables; connection profile attributes are set accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of default credentials ('password') which are insecure placeholders; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration module for a Neo4j client, handling environment variables, URI parsing, and connection profiles. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Default credentials are insecure but typical for placeholders. The code structure is clear, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. The security risk is low, primarily due to default credentials, which should be overridden in production environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for configuration management. There are no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the insecure default password, which is a common placeholder and not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the reports. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is suitable for use with proper configuration overrides.",
