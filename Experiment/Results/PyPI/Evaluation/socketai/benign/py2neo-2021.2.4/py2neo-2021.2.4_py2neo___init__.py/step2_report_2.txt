  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages configuration for Neo4j, reading environment variables, parsing URIs, and setting connection parameters.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious or malicious code constructs are identified. It employs standard practices. Default password ('password') is insecure but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the insecure default password, but the overall code is safe.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on configuration and connection setup.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets beyond default credentials, which are placeholders. The insecure default password ('password') is a security concern but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, configuration management.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity. Environment variables are used properly. Default credentials are insecure but typical.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuration for Neo4j connection, environment variables, URI parsing.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Default password is insecure but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, configuration setup.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious code. Default credentials are placeholders.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly lower, reflecting minimal security concern due to default password, but overall safe).  \n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None detected across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Risk scores:** The main concern is the insecure default password ('password'), which is a common placeholder but not malicious. Given the code's purpose (configuration management), the risk is low.  \n\n### My own estimates:  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to insecure defaults, but not malicious)  \n\n### Summary:  \nThe code is a standard configuration module for a Neo4j client library. It handles environment variables, URI parsing, and connection profiles securely within its scope. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The default password is insecure but is a common placeholder and not indicative of malicious behavior.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
