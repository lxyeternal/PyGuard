  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports conclude that the code is a standard socket wrapper with optional TLS security, handling connection, data transfer, and error management appropriately. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be well-structured and uses common libraries and practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the absence of suspicious activity.  \n   - They correctly identify that the SSL context defaults (using PROTOCOL_TLS fallback) could be less secure if not configured properly but do not suggest malicious intent.  \n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.  \n   - The reports' conclusions about the code's safety and legitimacy are justified based on the provided source.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, reflecting no malicious activity.  \n   - Security risk scores are low (0.2), which is reasonable given the nature of the code.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the clear, readable code.  \n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis and seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - None of the reports or the code indicates any reason to assign a risk score above 0.5.  \n   - The code is a standard network utility with proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.  \n   - Therefore, the risk scores of 0.2 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - The reports avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities beyond the SSL context fallback, which they acknowledge could be less secure if misconfigured.  \n   - No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and conclusions in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is clear and readable)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 (low risk, standard network utility code)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code's fallback to older SSL protocols could be improved for security, but this does not indicate malicious intent.  \n- The overall review confirms the code is a legitimate, well-implemented socket wrapper with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Summary**:  \nBased on the detailed reviews, I agree with the current scores. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and free of malware. The low security risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n**My estimated scores**:  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.2**  \n\nThese reflect the code's benign nature and the absence of malicious or suspicious features.",
