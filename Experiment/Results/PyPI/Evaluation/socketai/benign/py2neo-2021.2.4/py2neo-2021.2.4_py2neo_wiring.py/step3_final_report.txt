{
  "purpose": "A socket wrapper class providing low-level network communication with optional TLS security, handling connection, data transfer, and error management.",
  "sources": "Reads data from socket.recv(), reads from socket.getsockname() and socket.getpeername(), input buffers for read operations.",
  "sinks": "Socket send() and shutdown() methods, potential for data leakage if misused, but no evidence in code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from socket.recv() to internal buffers, then to output buffers for sending; connection setup flows from open() to socket connection; error handling flows from exceptions to error states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, standard SSL fallback to less secure protocol (PROTOCOL_SSLv23) if PROTOCOL_TLS unavailable; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured socket wrapper with optional TLS security, including connection management, secure wrapping, read/write buffers, and error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The fallback to PROTOCOL_SSLv23 is a known practice but less secure, which explains the low security risk score. The malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The overall design and implementation are legitimate and typical for network utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented socket wrapper with optional TLS, free of malware and obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects potential security considerations with default SSL protocols but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports' scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
