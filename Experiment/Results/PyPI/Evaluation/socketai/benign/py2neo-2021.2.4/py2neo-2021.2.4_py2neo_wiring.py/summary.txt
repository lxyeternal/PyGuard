  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented socket wrapper with optional TLS, free of malware and obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects potential security considerations with default SSL protocols but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports' scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
