  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, scoring justification, and any potential signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a socket wrapper with optional TLS, handling network communication. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code matches the description; no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.  \n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the absence of vulnerabilities, but considering the default SSL context might be less secure if misconfigured, a cautious score is acceptable.  \n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard practices, no malicious behavior, and proper error handling.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with previous; no issues detected.  \n- The reasoning aligns well with the code's nature.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard socket wrapper with optional TLS, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Again, consistent.  \n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.  \n- The security risk remains at 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, emphasizing standard practices, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues here.  \n- The scoring remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion—standard socket wrapper, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No concerns; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is accurate given the code clarity.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly cautious at 0.2 across all reports, justified by the use of default SSL contexts which might be less secure if misconfigured, but no direct vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.0.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.0.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Maintain at 0.2, considering the potential for misconfiguration but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured socket wrapper with optional TLS security.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.  \n- The slight security risk score reflects the fact that default SSL contexts can be less secure if not properly configured, but this is not an indication of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review and the evidence provided.",
