  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes a socket wrapper with secure options, matching the code. No discrepancies.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Use of default SSL context is noted, which could be less secure if not configured properly but does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, well-structured, with no malicious behavior. The confidence is high (0.9). Malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious patterns.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 is reasonable, given the default SSL context could be insecure if misconfigured, but no actual vulnerability is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning and scoring are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Matches the code's functions. No anomalies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Usage of SSL context with fallback is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2—reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly describes the code's functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. SSL context fallback is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical socket wrapper, safe and legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2—appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurately reflects the code's operation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. SSL fallback is common.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe socket wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2—justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Matches the code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is legitimate and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2—appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across reports is reasonable, considering the default SSL context could be insecure if misused, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented socket wrapper with optional TLS security.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential security considerations with default SSL context, but not an actual vulnerability)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the code's safety profile.",
