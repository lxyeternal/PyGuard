{
  "purpose": "A socket wrapper class for low-level network communication, providing secure connection options and data transfer methods.",
  "sources": "Input data from network sockets via recv() calls; configuration parameters like address and socket options.",
  "sinks": "Data written to network sockets via send() and write() methods; potentially vulnerable if untrusted data is sent or received without validation.",
  "flows": "Input data from socket.recv() flows into internal buffers, then to output buffers, and is sent over the network; secure method wraps socket with SSL context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of potentially insecure default SSL context in case of missing PROTOCOL_TLS. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or misleading variable names. No suspicious network connections or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a socket wrapper with optional TLS security. It includes connection setup, read/write buffers, security layer application, and proper error handling. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation is evident. The SSL context defaults may be less secure if not configured properly but do not indicate malicious intent. The code handles network communication reliably and securely in typical scenarios. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured socket communication wrapper with optional TLS security. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected based on this review.",
