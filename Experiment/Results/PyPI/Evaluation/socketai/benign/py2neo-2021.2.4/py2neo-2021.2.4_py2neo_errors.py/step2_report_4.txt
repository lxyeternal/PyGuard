  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of exception classes for Neo4j error handling, with no external data input, network activity, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and standard for such a purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports do not identify any errors or flaws in the code logic. They correctly note that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns. No issues such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are observed.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness**:  \n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n   - The security risk score is very low (0.1 or 0), aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely for error handling and does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any malicious constructs, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as standard exception handling classes.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided. All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment and Personal Estimation**:  \n   Given the detailed reviews, I concur that the code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. My own estimate aligns with the reports:\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1 (due to the potential for misuse if error messages leak sensitive info, but no such evidence here)\n\n**Final conclusion**:  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for a Neo4j driver, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, due to error handling context, but no actual risk observed)",
