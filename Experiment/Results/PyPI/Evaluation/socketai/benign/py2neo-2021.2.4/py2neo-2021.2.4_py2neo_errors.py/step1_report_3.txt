{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Neo4j database errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data or sends data to external entities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is mainly a library of exception classes and error handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The code is standard exception handling and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for Neo4j database error handling, including logic to classify errors based on error codes. It includes methods for error classification, message formatting, and decision-making for retries or invalidation. There are no inputs, external data processing, or network communication; it purely models error scenarios. No obfuscated code, no malicious behavior, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of exception classes for a Neo4j Python driver or library. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, and there are no indications of malware or security risks.",
