{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Neo4j database interactions and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from a dictionary in hydrate() method, and the code itself is statically defined.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and handling, but no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No external data flow; exception classes are used for error handling within the application.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements structured exception classes with methods for categorization and retry logic. The hydrate() method processes input data for error codes, but relies on trusted data structures. No external input is processed without validation, and no code injection or malicious behavior is evident. The code is standard for error modeling in a database driver context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a Neo4j driver, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no hardcoded credentials, no external data injection, and no suspicious logic. It appears safe and intended solely for error handling.",
