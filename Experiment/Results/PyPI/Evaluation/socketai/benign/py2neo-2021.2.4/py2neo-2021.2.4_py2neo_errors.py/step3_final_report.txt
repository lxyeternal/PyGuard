{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling Neo4j error responses and connection issues, facilitating error classification and retry logic.",
  "sources": "Error code strings in hydrate() and split_code() methods, error message arguments in exception initializers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; error messages are constructed internally. No external data flows or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Error code strings from hydrate() -> split_code() -> classification logic; exception raising and handling within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for error modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for Neo4j error handling, parsing error codes, and classifying errors for retry or invalidation. It relies on trusted data inputs and contains no network activity or malicious constructs. The error classification logic is conventional, and no external data or untrusted input processing poses security risks. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All observed signals indicate a benign, standard error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Neo4j error classes with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis, confirming the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
