  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and error handling for Neo4j database interactions.",
  "sources": "None (no input data reading or external data sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data output or external communication).",
  "flows": "None (no data flows from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard error handling classes; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes for handling Neo4j errors, with methods for parsing error codes and deciding on retry logic. It primarily provides structured error handling and does not perform any network operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code is well-structured and follows typical patterns for exception management in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for Neo4j error handling with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
