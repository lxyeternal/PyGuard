{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors and status codes related to Neo4j database interactions.",
  "sources": "The entire code defines classes and methods, with data inputs coming from method parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be included in exception messages or error data, but no external or untrusted input is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Input data (error details) flows through hydrate() and split_code() methods, affecting exception creation and error classification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Exception handling and class structure are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code creates structured exception classes for database error handling, with methods to interpret error codes and determine retry logic. All code follows standard patterns without obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No external data is processed in a malicious way; error messages and codes are used for classification. The overall implementation appears to be a straightforward error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for Neo4j error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is clean, well-structured, and appears to serve a legitimate purpose within a database driver or client library.",
