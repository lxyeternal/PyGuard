  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code defines exception classes for Neo4j error handling, with methods to parse error codes and classify errors.\n- No external input or untrusted data is processed; the hydrate() method relies on data passed in, presumably from trusted sources.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.\n- The report assigns a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk is minimal, given the code's purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis appears accurate. The code is standard for error modeling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it describes exception classes for Neo4j errors.\n- No external data handling or network activity.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns observed.\n- Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The report's confidence is high (1), which seems justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, the code defines exception classes with error classification logic.\n- No external data processing or suspicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation or malicious activity detected.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- The confidence level is high.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports, with focus on error handling classes.\n- No external data flow or malicious activity.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- The report's confidence is high.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: exception classes, error code parsing, and retry logic.\n- No external input or malicious code.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for Neo4j error handling.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- The security risk remains very low, primarily because this code is purely for error modeling.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low; standard error handling code)\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with my assessment. The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.",
