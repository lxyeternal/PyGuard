  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists of class definitions for error handling related to Neo4j. The code is static, does not process untrusted external data, and does not perform network operations or code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is standard, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or suspicious elements. No logical flaws or errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign a very low risk (0.1 or 0), which aligns with the analysis that this code is a benign error handling module with no security implications.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely for error handling, with no external data input, no code execution, and no network activity, there's no basis for increasing the malware or risk scores. The code is not malicious, nor does it pose a security threat.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is standard and safe.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very minimal, reflecting the very low security risk of this benign code)\n\n**Final Justification**:  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for a Neo4j driver or client library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no external data processing that could introduce security risks. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis that the code is safe, legitimate, and poses no security threat.",
