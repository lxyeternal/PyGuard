  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Neo4j database operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines classes and methods for error handling and does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard for exception handling and class definition. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for Neo4j errors, with methods for parsing error codes and classifying error types. It uses standard Python exception handling patterns without external data processing or network activity. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a database driver or client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for Neo4j error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
