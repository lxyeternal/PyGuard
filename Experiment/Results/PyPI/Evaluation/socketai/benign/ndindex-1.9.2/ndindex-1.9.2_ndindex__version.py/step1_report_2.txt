{
  "purpose": "To generate and retrieve version information for the package based on pre-generated JSON data.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded JSON string 'version_json' which contains version metadata.",
  "sinks": "The json.loads() function that parses the JSON string into a Python dictionary.",
  "flows": "The code reads the hardcoded JSON string and processes it with json.loads(), returning the parsed dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The JSON string is static, and there are no dynamic inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code loads version metadata from a static JSON string and provides a function to retrieve it. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a straightforward version info generator, likely used for package version reporting. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The comment indicates the file was auto-generated, and the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply loads static version metadata from a hardcoded JSON string and provides it via a function. There is no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks associated with this code.",
