  "purpose": "Provides static version metadata by parsing a predefined JSON string.",
  "sources": "Static JSON string assigned to 'version_json'. No external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only reads from a static string and returns parsed data.",
  "flows": "Reads from 'version_json' and returns the parsed dictionary via 'json.loads()'. No external flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and static. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static JSON string containing version info, which is parsed by 'json.loads()' in 'get_versions()'. It performs no network activity, external input handling, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the static, straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info provider with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
