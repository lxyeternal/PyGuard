  "purpose": "Implementations of the Chinese Remainder Theorem and related number-theoretic functions for modular arithmetic calculations.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; it defines functions for internal calculations. No data sources or external inputs are used within these functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or write output to external systems. No data leakage or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Function calls such as gcdex, _crt, solve_congruence, and crt process internal data for number-theoretic calculations; no source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic execution, or misleading variables. The code consists solely of mathematical functions with clear purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-documented algorithms for computing the greatest common divisor, extended Euclidean algorithm, Chinese Remainder Theorem, and least common multiple. It references external licenses and dependencies, explicitly states no error checking in some functions, and does not include any network, file, or system interaction. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system commands are present. The functions appear to serve legitimate computational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of number theory algorithms for modular arithmetic, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is purely mathematical and does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
