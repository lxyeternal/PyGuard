{
  "purpose": "Provides implementations of the Chinese Remainder Theorem and associated helper functions for modular arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, including lists of residues and moduli, as well as intermediate variables within functions.",
  "sinks": "Performs computations resulting in a combined residue value; no evident data leaks or untrusted data effects; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (residues, moduli) flow through functions like _crt, solve_congruence, and crt, resulting in calculated residues or combined values; no external sinks or side-effects are present.",
  "anomalies": "Contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. Uses standard math functions. No dynamic code execution or external resource access is evident. License comments and detailed explanations are present but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard algorithms for the Chinese Remainder Theorem, including gcd-based calculations, combining congruences, and solving systems of modular equations. It relies solely on mathematical operations with inputs provided as function arguments. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, file manipulation, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward, well-documented, and use standard library functions. No suspicious behaviors, anomalies, or malicious intents are detected. The license comments are standard and do not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem and related modular arithmetic functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a utility module for mathematical operations, unlikely to cause security risks.",
