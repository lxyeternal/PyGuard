  "purpose": "Implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem and related functions for solving modular arithmetic problems.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (e.g., residues and moduli), as well as from internal calculations and helper functions like gcdex.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points are limited to the calculation of modular inverses, the combined residue calculation, and the solve_congruence function, which manipulate integers based on input data. No direct data leaks or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (residues and moduli) flows through gcdex and _crt to produce combined results; the solve_congruence function merges multiple pairs into a solution; crt function verifies and returns the result based on internal computations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive licensing comments but no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard math functions and explicit comments reduces suspicion. No suspicious or misleading code structures are evident. No external calls or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard algorithms for the Chinese Remainder Theorem, including gcdex for extended Euclidean algorithm, _crt for low-level computation, solve_congruence for combining multiple congruences, and crt as a wrapper with verification. The functions utilize common mathematical procedures, do not include any hidden or unusual logic, and only perform integer calculations based on provided inputs. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is evident. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose and no obfuscated segments or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem and associated algorithms. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The only potential concern is the misuse of these functions if fed untrusted input, but this is typical for mathematical routines. Overall, the code appears safe with no security risks identified.",
