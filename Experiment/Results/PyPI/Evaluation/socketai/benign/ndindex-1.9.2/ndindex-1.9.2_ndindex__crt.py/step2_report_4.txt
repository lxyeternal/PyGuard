  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem and related number-theoretic functions.\n- It relies solely on mathematical computations, with no external data sources, network activity, or system modifications.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions accept user-provided inputs (residues and moduli), which could be misused if fed malicious data, but this is typical for such algorithms.\n- Licensing references are standard, and the code appears to be a faithful, straightforward adaptation of known algorithms.\n\n---\n\n### **Individual Report Analysis**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Benign mathematical functions implementing CRT, no malicious intent.\n- **Flow:** Data flows through mathematical functions; no external sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard algorithms, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (minimal concern for misuse), confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is appropriate. The malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Mathematical implementation of CRT functions.\n- **Flow:** Internal calculations only, no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, well-documented algorithms.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Implementations of CRT and number theory functions.\n- **Flow:** Internal data, no external sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, straightforward algorithms.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** CRT and helper functions.\n- **Flow:** Data flows through standard mathematical functions.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard algorithms, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Mathematical CRT functions.\n- **Flow:** Data only through functions, no external sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, legitimate algorithms.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (minimal, due to potential misuse).\n\n**Assessment:** The low securityRisk is justified. Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the potential for misuse if untrusted inputs are fed into these mathematical functions. Since these functions could be used maliciously if inputs are controlled by an attacker (e.g., causing integer overflows in some languages or exploiting computational resources), a minimal risk score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear, well-documented, and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, primarily due to potential misuse of mathematical functions with untrusted inputs, but no actual security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, benign implementation of number theory algorithms with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis.",
