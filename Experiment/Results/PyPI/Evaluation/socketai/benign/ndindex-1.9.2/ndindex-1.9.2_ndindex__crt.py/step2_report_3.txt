  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports explicitly state that the code performs standard mathematical functions related to the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n   - No report mentions any network activity, file operations, or other system modifications.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The license and comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n2. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The functions implement well-known number theory algorithms (gcd, extended Euclidean algorithm, CRT, etc.).\n   - Inputs are parameters; outputs are mathematical results.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The code relies solely on the standard library and straightforward logic.\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Vulnerabilities:**\n   - Since the code handles user-provided data for mathematical calculations, incorrect or malicious inputs could lead to unexpected results or computational issues, but this is typical for such mathematical routines.\n   - No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - The functions do not perform any external system calls or network operations.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis—no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0.0), reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging the potential misuse if inputs are untrusted (which is typical for such functions).\n\n5. **Any Logical Flaws or Mistakes?**\n   - The code is standard; no logical flaws are evident.\n   - Some functions mention no error checking, but this is explicitly stated and typical for low-level math routines.\n\n6. **Summary & Personal Assessment:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, well-documented implementation of number theory algorithms.\n   - No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (acceptable, considering potential misuse but no actual risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a benign mathematical utility with no security concerns.",
