  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the scoring rationale, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code implements the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and related functions, reading inputs from parameters, with no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or data leaks; data flows through mathematical functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard number theory algorithms, relying on well-understood mathematics.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, with high confidence (1.0). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of CRT and related functions. No malicious behavior, no external data leaks, no suspicious code. The malware score is appropriate at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard number theory functions, no external data sources, no external sinks, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, and the code is purely mathematical.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above; no issues detected, malware score justified at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the standard nature of the implementation, with no external data or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just mathematical functions.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on the same points: standard algorithms, no external data sources or sinks, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, safe to assume.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still emphasizes standard, well-documented algorithms with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected, only potential concern if inputs are untrusted, which is typical for such functions.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The low confidence (0.9) might reflect minor uncertainty, but overall, the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, mathematical implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem and related functions.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code operates solely on mathematical inputs and outputs, with no external network or file operations.\n- The malware scores across reports are consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily because misuse of mathematical functions could lead to incorrect results if inputs are malicious, but this is a typical risk for mathematical routines.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code's license references SymPy, but the implementation appears standard and does not incorporate any suspicious or malicious modifications.\n- The functions are safe, well-documented, and rely on known algorithms.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
