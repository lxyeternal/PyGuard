  "purpose": "Setup script for building and cleaning a Python package with Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, environment variable CYTHON_COVERAGE, glob patterns for cleanup.",
  "sinks": "os.remove, shutil.rmtree, print statements (non-malicious). No untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable CYTHON_COVERAGE influences macro definitions for Cython extensions; glob patterns for cleanup operate on local filesystem paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected. The code appears standard for a setup script with Cython extensions and cleanup commands.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README.md file to get a long description. It checks an environment variable to optionally enable coverage in Cython. It defines Cython extensions with possible macro definitions. It includes a custom 'CleanCommand' to remove build artifacts using glob patterns, which is standard. No untrusted data sources or network interactions are present. The setup configuration specifies package details, dependencies, and classifiers. Overall, the code is typical for a Python package setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with Cython extensions and cleanup functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
