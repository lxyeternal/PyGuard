  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'ndindex' Python package, including Cython extension compilation and cleanup routines.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, environment variable CYTHON_COVERAGE, glob patterns in cleanup command",
  "sinks": "File deletion via glob patterns in cleanup command",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences macros; glob patterns identify files for deletion",
  "anomalies": "Use of glob patterns for file cleanup, which could potentially delete unintended files if misused",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, involving reading a README, configuring Cython extensions with optional coverage macros, and defining a custom cleanup command that deletes build artifacts using glob patterns. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The cleanup routines are typical but could pose risks if misconfigured, though there is no evidence of malicious intent. Environment variables are used for optional debugging features, which is common. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign and routine nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The cleanup routines and environment variable usage are standard and do not pose significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
