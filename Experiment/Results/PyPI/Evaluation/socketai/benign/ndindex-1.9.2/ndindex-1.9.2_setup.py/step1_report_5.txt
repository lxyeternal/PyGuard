{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'ndindex', including compilation of Cython extensions, package metadata, and a custom clean command.",
  "sources": "File reading (README.md), environment variable (CYTHON_COVERAGE), glob patterns for cleanup",
  "sinks": "File operations for cleanup, environment variable usage for build configuration",
  "flows": "Reading environment variable to set macros -> Using macros in Cython extensions -> Running cleanup via glob pattern matching files/directories",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network calls, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks, such as reading a README file, configuring Cython extensions with optional coverage support based on environment variables, defining a custom 'clean' command that deletes build artifacts, and specifying package metadata. All file operations are standard cleanup procedures, and environment variable usage is typical for build configuration. No external network connections or data leaks are present. No malicious or suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with Cython extensions and a custom cleanup command. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks based on the provided content.",
