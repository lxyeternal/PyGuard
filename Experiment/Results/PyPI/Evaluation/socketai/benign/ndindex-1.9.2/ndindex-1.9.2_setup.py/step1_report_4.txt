  "purpose": "Setup script for building and cleaning the ndindex Python package, including Cython extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, environment variable CYTHON_COVERAGE, glob patterns for cleaning files, versioneer for version info.",
  "sinks": "File operations during cleaning, environment variables affecting build, and package metadata.",
  "flows": "Environment variable CYTHON_COVERAGE influences build configuration; glob-based cleaning removes files; setup uses versioneer for versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No suspicious network activity, no data exfiltration, no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It reads a markdown file for description, configures Cython extensions, and defines a custom clean command that removes build artifacts. Environment variables influence build options but do not introduce security risks. The glob patterns for cleaning are typical for Python projects. The use of versioneer for versioning is common. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data leaks, or backdoors. All operations are typical for package setup and maintenance. No obfuscated code or suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with Cython extensions and a custom clean command. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
