  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package with Cython extensions.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The cleanup command uses glob patterns to delete build artifacts, which is typical, but could potentially delete unintended files if misused. However, this is standard practice.\n- Environment variables influence build options but are used in a typical manner.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads or suspicious logic.\n- The cleanup command could be risky if misused, but it is a common pattern.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The glob patterns in `CleanCommand` include patterns like `'./**/*.so'`, `'./**/*.c'`, `'./**/*.cpp'`, which rely on `glob.glob` with `recursive=True`. These patterns are valid, but if misused, they could delete unintended files. Nonetheless, this is standard for cleanup routines.\n- No security flaws or code injection vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 in reports, which seems reasonable given the cleanup routine and environment variable use. However, these are minimal risks, and the code is standard.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The highest risk score (0.2) accounts for the potential misuse of glob patterns in cleanup, but this is a common pattern and not inherently dangerous.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (acceptable given the cleanup routine, but still low)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the provided scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard setup script)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are reasonable and justified.",
