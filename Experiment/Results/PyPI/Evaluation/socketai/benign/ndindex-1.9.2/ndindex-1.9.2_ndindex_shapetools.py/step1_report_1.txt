{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for handling broadcasting, shape manipulation, and index iteration for multi-dimensional arrays, likely to support array or tensor operations in a numerical computing context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input shapes, index values, and parameters like skip_axes from function arguments and internal variables such as shape tuples, indices, and slices.",
  "sinks": "The code manipulates shape tuples, index ranges, slices, and produces iterators for array indices; no data leaks or untrusted data effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input shapes are processed and normalized; broadcast shapes are computed; index iterators generate tuples of indices based on broadcasted shapes and skip axes; internal functions translate skip axes to indices; no external data or untrusted sources are involved in critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of internal helper functions appears standard for shape and index manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of shape validation, broadcasting logic, and index iteration functions. It uses internal helper functions to normalize skip axes, convert shapes, and handle index manipulations. The functions are well-structured, with appropriate error handling for shape mismatches and invalid axes. No network, file system, or privileged system calls are present. No obfuscated code or malicious intent is evident. The functions operate solely on data structures related to array shapes and indices, and all operations are standard within the context of numerical array processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe utility module for array shape and index management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code performs expected operations for array broadcasting and indexing support without external dependencies that could be exploited. Overall, it is a standard, benign implementation of array shape and index utilities.",
