{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for broadcasting shapes and iterating over indices of broadcasted arrays, supporting skip axes and validation.",
  "sources": "Shape tuples provided as arguments, internal functions like asshape, ndindex, associated_axis, and range-based iterators.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Shapes are validated and normalized; broadcasted shape computed; index iterators generate source indices; internal helpers manage shape transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of shape validation, broadcasting, and index iteration utilities. It performs internal computations without external effects. No external dependencies or system calls are used. The code includes exception classes for shape and axis errors, with validation functions ensuring shape correctness. Index iteration functions generate indices based on broadcasted shapes, supporting skip axes and complex broadcasting rules. The internal helpers manage shape transformations, index removal, and insertion, all within safe, internal logic. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for shape broadcasting and index iteration, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score should be low (~0.1), reflecting the internal, safe nature of the functions. The high confidence in safety is justified.",
