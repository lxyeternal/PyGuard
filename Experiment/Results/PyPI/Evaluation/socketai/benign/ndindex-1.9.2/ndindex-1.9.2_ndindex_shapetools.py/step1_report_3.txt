{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for broadcasting shapes, iterating over indices of broadcasted arrays, and handling shape manipulations, primarily supporting a larger numerical or tensor manipulation library.",
  "sources": "Data sources include function arguments such as shapes, skip_axes, and input parameters for functions like broadcast_shapes and iter_indices. Internal variables and local computations also read shape information and indices.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the construction of ranges, slices, and tuples that generate indices, which could be used maliciously if supplied with untrusted data. There are no direct data leaks, network connections, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided shape and skip_axes inputs through functions like asshape and normalize_skip_axes to internal computations, and then to index generation and shape broadcasting logic. The functions handle untrusted shape data, but there are no critical external effects or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as network calls, file I/O, or system commands. The code performs shape computations, exception handling, and internal iteration. The ncycles class internally repeats sequences with a custom repr, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of internal exception classes for control flow, which is standard for such libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for broadcasting and indexing shapes, with thorough input validation and internal helper functions. It avoids external system calls, network operations, or data leaks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code patterns are present. The presence of exception classes and internal functions like remove_indices and unremove_indices supports safe shape and index manipulations. The ncycles class and normalize_skip_axes functions provide internal iteration and normalization utilities, which are common in tensor libraries. Overall, the code seems designed for safe shape broadcasting and index iteration without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for shape broadcasting and index iteration in numerical arrays. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The implementation appears legitimate and focused on shape and index manipulations for numerical data processing.",
