{
  "purpose": "Represents a tuple of single-axis indices for advanced array indexing, supporting various index types such as integers, slices, ellipses, new axes, and boolean or integer arrays.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, class attributes, and imported modules providing index components and numpy functions for shape and index manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Numpy broadcasting, shape calculations, and index transformations; no external data transmission or malicious data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from index arguments through reduction, broadcasting, and shape calculations within numpy operations, culminating in index tuple construction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; code is complex but standard for index handling libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for handling multi-dimensional index tuples with methods for reduction, broadcasting, expansion, subindexing, and shape calculation. It relies on numpy for array operations and shape manipulations. No signs of malicious activity such as network access, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The code performs complex index manipulations and shape validations, typical for a numerical library, with proper validation and no suspicious patterns. The import statements are placed at the bottom to avoid circular dependencies. The logic is consistent, and the data flow is confined within index and shape transformations, with no external or malicious interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a multi-axis index tuple handler for array operations. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input, which is mitigated through validation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, aligning with the code's purpose and complexity.",
