  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a multi-axis index tuple handler for array operations. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input, which is mitigated through validation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, aligning with the code's purpose and complexity."
