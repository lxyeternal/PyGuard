{
  "purpose": "This code is for importing and defining module exports for a package, primarily exposing classes, functions, and variables for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from internal modules (.ndindex, .shapetools, .slice, etc.) and accesses the version information from _version.get_versions().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks; the code only sets up exports and retrieves version info.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing internal modules, adding specific components to the __all__ list, and then obtaining the version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The use of __all__ for exports and dynamic version fetching is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically imports specific components from internal modules, updates the __all__ list for exports, and fetches version info. The pattern is typical for Python package __init__.py files. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The dynamic version retrieval and cleanup are standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization file that exports modules and retrieves version information. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks detected.",
