{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the CategoricalImputer class, verifying various imputation strategies, error handling, and data types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the df_na DataFrame used in multiple test functions.",
  "sinks": "The code performs in-memory data transformations and assertions; no external data or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded into df_na, transformed via fit_transform, and compared against reference DataFrames to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of standard unit tests for data imputation, with no external system interactions or malicious patterns. It uses common libraries (pandas, pytest) and performs straightforward data manipulations and assertions. No anomalies or security concerns are evident, and the code's intent is purely to validate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured testing code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting its safe and controlled nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
