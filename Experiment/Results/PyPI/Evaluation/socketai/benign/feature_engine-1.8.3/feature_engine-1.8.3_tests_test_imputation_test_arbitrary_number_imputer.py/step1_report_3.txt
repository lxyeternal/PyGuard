  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ArbitraryNumberImputer class in the feature_engine.imputation module, verifying its functionality and input validation.",
  "sources": "Imports of pandas, pytest, and the ArbitraryNumberImputer class; function parameters such as df_na (DataFrame with missing values).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; tests involve internal data manipulation only.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> ArbitraryNumberImputer.fit_transform() -> DataFrame output with imputed values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is standard testing procedures for a scikit-learn-like transformer class.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit testing for a data imputation transformer, including parameter validation and output correctness. It tests initialization with different parameters, proper handling of missing data, and input validation errors for invalid types. All operations involve safe DataFrame manipulations and do not process untrusted input sources or perform network/file I/O. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious logic detected. The code's purpose is clearly for testing, with no malicious intent or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a data imputer class, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply validates the functionality and input validation of the class.",
