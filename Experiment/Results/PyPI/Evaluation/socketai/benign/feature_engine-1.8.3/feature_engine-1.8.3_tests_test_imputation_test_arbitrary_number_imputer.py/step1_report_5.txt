  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ArbitraryNumberImputer class from feature_engine.imputation, validating different imputation scenarios.",
  "sources": "Imports from pandas and pytest; use of ArbitraryNumberImputer; test functions accepting df_na as input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external output is performed.",
  "flows": "Input data (df_na) is transformed via fit_transform method; validation checks compare output to expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for a data imputation class. It performs data manipulation, validation, and exception handling. No external network calls, file operations, or malicious code behavior are present. The functions test standard data imputation processes, with proper exception handling for invalid input types. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe set of unit tests for a data imputation class. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be intended for validating data processing logic without any harmful actions.",
