  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ArbitraryNumberImputer class, verifying its behavior with different input parameters and data.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from df_na (assumed to be a pandas DataFrame), accessing class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on DataFrame transformations and parameter validation; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> imputer.fit_transform() -> transformed DataFrame -> assertions; parameter validation flow within constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies detected. The code primarily performs standard unit testing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple test functions for the ArbitraryNumberImputer class, which is designed for imputing missing values with specified numbers. The tests verify proper initialization, parameter handling, error raising for invalid inputs, and correct data transformation. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network access, or hidden backdoors. The code does not process external untrusted input beyond standard unit testing inputs, and all assertions are standard checks. No obfuscation or unusual language features are used.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a data imputation class. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The code is safe and serves purely as testing scaffolding for the class functionality.",
