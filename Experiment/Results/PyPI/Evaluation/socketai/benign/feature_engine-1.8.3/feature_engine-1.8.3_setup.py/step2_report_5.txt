  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing static file reads to gather metadata and dependencies.\n- All reports agree that there are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious activities.\n- The code reads files from local, controlled sources: README.md, requirements.txt, and a VERSION file.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code is typical and adheres to standard packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports and analysis confirm that the code is straightforward, with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n\n- **Logical errors or flaws?**  \n  None identified. The code functions as intended for a setup script.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or 0.5, reflecting no significant security risk. Given the code's nature, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard and safe.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.",
