  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'feature_engine'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', 'README.md', and 'VERSION' file; using Path for file handling.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reading files (requirements.txt, README.md, VERSION) into variables for setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources into critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic present. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata and dependencies from local files and prepares the package for distribution via setuptools. It employs safe file handling and standard practices without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. No indicators of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, safe setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected.",
