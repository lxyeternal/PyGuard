  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading static files for metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from local files: README.md, requirements.txt, VERSION file within package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static file reads from filesystem; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that loads package metadata from local files and uses setuptools for packaging. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input. The absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns indicates a benign and standard implementation. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a risk score of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
