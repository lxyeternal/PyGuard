{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the package metadata and configuration for the Python package 'feature_engine'.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, reads VERSION file for version number, and reads requirements.txt for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external input are present; all file reads are from controlled package files.",
  "flows": "Reads package version and dependencies from local files; these are static file reads during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network activity. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading static files for metadata, defining requirements, and calling setup(). No external data is processed at runtime, nor are there any dynamic code executions or network communications. All file reads are from local package files, which is typical for Python package setup scripts. The code structure is conventional and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads local files to gather package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or malicious actions present.",
