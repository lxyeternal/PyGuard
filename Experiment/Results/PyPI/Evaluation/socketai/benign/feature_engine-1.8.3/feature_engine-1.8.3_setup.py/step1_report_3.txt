  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'feature_engine' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt', 'README.md', and a 'VERSION' file within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and version info, uses setup() to configure package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns identified. The code is standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading documentation, dependencies, and version info; configuring package metadata. All file operations are standard and do not involve user input or untrusted sources. No code injection, network activity, or other malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python packaging setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any unsafe operations, and the use of third-party libraries is appropriate for its purpose.",
