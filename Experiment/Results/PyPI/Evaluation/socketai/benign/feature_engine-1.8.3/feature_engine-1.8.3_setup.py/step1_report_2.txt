{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'feature_engine' by defining its metadata, requirements, and packaging instructions for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'VERSION' file within 'feature_engine' directory to get version info, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the data read sources are used in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading files ('README.md', 'VERSION', 'requirements.txt') and then passing static data to setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. All file operations are reading static, local files. No suspicious or obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static configuration tasks for package setup: reading files for package description and version info, defining dependencies, and calling setuptools.setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. It adheres to standard packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no indications of malware. It is safe for use and deployment.",
