  "purpose": "Setup script for the feature_engine Python package, handling package metadata, dependencies, and distribution configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt', 'README.md', and 'feature_engine/VERSION' files to gather metadata and requirements.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data directly; it primarily reads static files and configuration data.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description data from files; uses setuptools to define package setup parameters based on static inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The file performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup procedures using setuptools. It reads static files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'VERSION') to populate metadata. The functions and variables are straightforward, with no dynamic execution, network access, or untrusted data processing. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. All operations are consistent with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard file reads and package configuration tasks.",
