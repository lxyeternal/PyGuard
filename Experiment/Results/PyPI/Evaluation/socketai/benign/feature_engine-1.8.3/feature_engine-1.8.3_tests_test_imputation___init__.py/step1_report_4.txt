  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard functionality, likely related to data processing or utility functions, but without further context, the specific intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, user input, or external modules, though no explicit sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or execution of system commands, but none are explicitly evident in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions, but no clear source-to-sink paths are identifiable without additional context.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis reveals standard import statements, straightforward functions, and no signs of malicious behavior. There are no suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to perform its intended functionality without unusual or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems benign with standard practices, although the lack of detailed context limits absolute certainty.",
