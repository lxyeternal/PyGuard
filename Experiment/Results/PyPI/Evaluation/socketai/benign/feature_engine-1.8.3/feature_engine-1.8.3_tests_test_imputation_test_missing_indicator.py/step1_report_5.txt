  "purpose": "Unit tests for the AddMissingIndicator class in feature_engine.imputation module, verifying its functionality and behavior.",
  "sources": "Test functions and import statements; test input data df_na used in various test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; no data output or external calls that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from df_na into AddMissingIndicator via fit_transform and fit methods; no flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is standard testing code for a scikit-learn compatible transformer.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises several pytest-based test functions that instantiate and test the AddMissingIndicator transformer. It checks for correct attribute setting, error handling, and output features. All data used appears to be standard DataFrame inputs, with no evidence of malicious payloads, external data retrieval, or suspicious code behaviors. The imports are typical for testing, and no code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of straightforward unit tests for a scikit-learn transformer, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
