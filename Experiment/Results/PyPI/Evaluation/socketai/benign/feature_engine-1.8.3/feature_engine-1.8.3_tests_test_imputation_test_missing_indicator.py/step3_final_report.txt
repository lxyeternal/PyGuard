{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest unit tests for the AddMissingIndicator class from feature_engine, verifying its behavior, parameter handling, error conditions, and output features.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the df_na DataFrame used in the tests.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code does not perform external operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading df_na, applying fit_transform or fit, and generating feature names; no external or malicious data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present; the code is straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of standard unit tests for a data transformation class, with no network calls, file operations, or external data transmissions. It performs attribute checks, error handling, and feature name outputs. The code is well-structured, uses common testing practices, and does not include obfuscated or malicious patterns. The data used (df_na) appears to be typical test data. No suspicious behavior, external dependencies, or malicious payloads are detected. The tests do not handle untrusted data in a malicious way, nor do they invoke external systems. The code's purpose is purely validation of the feature_engine component, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for a data preprocessing class. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score should be 0, and the overall security risk score should be 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
