  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for a data preprocessing class. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score should be 0, and the overall security risk score should be 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1)."
