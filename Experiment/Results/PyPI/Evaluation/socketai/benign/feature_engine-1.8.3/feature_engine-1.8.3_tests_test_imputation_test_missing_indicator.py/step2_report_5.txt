  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of unit tests for the `AddMissingIndicator` class from `feature_engine`.\n- They confirm the code is standard testing code, with no external system interactions, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code relies on pytest, sklearn pipelines, and the feature_engine library, which are standard tools.\n- The input data `df_na` is used consistently for testing, with no indication of untrusted data sources.\n\n**Specific Observations:**\n- The code performs typical unit testing: parameter validation, error handling, feature name output, and behavior with different configurations.\n- The reports correctly identify that no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- No evidence of code that could be used maliciously, such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- The logic and assertions are straightforward and consistent with standard testing practices.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0. The code contains no malicious behavior, payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear, readable, and uses standard testing idioms.\n- **Risk score:** 0. The code is purely for testing and does not pose any security risk.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The overall security risk is also correctly assessed as zero.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- Based on the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- The code is a legitimate, standard test suite with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, well-structured testing code with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
