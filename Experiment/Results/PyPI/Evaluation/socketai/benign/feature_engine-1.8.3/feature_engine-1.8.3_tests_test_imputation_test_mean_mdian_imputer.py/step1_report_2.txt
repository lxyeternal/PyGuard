{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the functionality of the MeanMedianImputer class for imputation of missing data using mean or median methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the df_na DataFrame parameter in test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is output or used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from df_na flows through the fit_transform method of the imputer to produce transformed dataframes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward unit tests with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard data processing and testing libraries, defines test functions for a data imputer class, and performs assertions to verify expected behavior. It manipulates dataframes, checks parameter settings, and validates output data, all of which are typical for testing data imputation logic. No data leaks, external network calls, or system modifications are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain threats.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for a data imputation class, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be safe, well-structured, and does not include any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
