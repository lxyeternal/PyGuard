  "flows": "DataFrame df_na -> imputer.fit_transform() -> assertions on output and internal attributes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of a pandas-based imputer, operating solely on in-memory data with no external interactions. It verifies internal attributes and output correctness. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The tests are safe, and the code is transparent and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
