{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the MeanMedianImputer class from the feature_engine library, validating imputation methods and variable selections.",
  "sources": "Import statements (pandas, pytest, feature_engine.imputation), creation and configuration of MeanMedianImputer objects, and test functions that utilize df_na (assumed to be a DataFrame input).",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exception handling within test functions; no external or untrusted data handling, no network operations, no file operations, no command execution.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame df_na flows into the imputer.fit_transform() method, with imputer configuration and validation steps following; no data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected. The code adheres to standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary libraries, defines three test functions for different scenarios of the MeanMedianImputer, and performs assertions on object attributes and transformed data. The code utilizes standard unit testing patterns with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The focus is solely on validating imputation logic, with no external data or system interactions that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a data imputation class, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified. It is safe and standard in practice.",
