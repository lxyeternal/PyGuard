{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for the 'MeanMedianImputer' class from the 'feature_engine.imputation' module, designed to verify correct imputation behavior on a DataFrame with missing values.",
  "sources": "Imports from pandas, pytest, and feature_engine.imputation; DataFrame inputs 'df_na' used in tests.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, network, or files; no untrusted data outputs or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "DataFrames are read from 'df_na'; methods process these DataFrames internally without external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code follows standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard data science and testing libraries, sets up unit tests for the imputer class, and performs assertions to verify expected behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are detected. All functions serve straightforward testing purposes, and no anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite for a data imputation class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code performs typical unit testing without external threats or malicious intent.",
