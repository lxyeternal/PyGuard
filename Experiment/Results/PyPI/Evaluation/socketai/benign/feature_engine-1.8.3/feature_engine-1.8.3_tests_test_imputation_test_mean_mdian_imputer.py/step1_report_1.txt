  "purpose": "Unit tests for the MeanMedianImputer class to verify mean/median imputation functionality and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports pandas, pytest, and a class from feature_engine.imputation; uses test data 'df_na'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or outputs. Tests primarily operate on in-memory DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Code appears straightforward and standard for testing a class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, defines test functions for a specific imputer class, and performs assertions to verify correct imputer behavior. It sets parameters, runs fit_transform on test data, and checks outputs and internal states. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic is present. All operations are typical for unit testing. No obfuscation or hidden code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for a data imputation class, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and appears to be legitimate testing code.",
