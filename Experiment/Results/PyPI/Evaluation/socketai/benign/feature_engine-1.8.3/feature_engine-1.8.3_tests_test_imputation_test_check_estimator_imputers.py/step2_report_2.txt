  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward test suite for various feature_engine and sklearn estimators, performing compatibility checks and transformations on static pandas data structures. No suspicious activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard testing script. The absence of untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscated code supports a malware score of 0. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Score justification:** The risk score of 0 aligns with the absence of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the local data used in tests, version checks, and parameter modifications. No external data or malicious behavior is observed.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No code patterns or data flows suggest malicious intent. Malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Score justification:** No security risks are present; the score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard unit testing setup with local data, version compatibility, and parameter adjustments. No external inputs or suspicious activities.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the benign nature of the code. Malware score is 0.\n\n- **Score justification:** No malware or security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on local data flow, standard testing practices, and absence of external or untrusted data handling. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. Malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Score justification:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard testing pattern, with local data, parameter setting, and no external interactions. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and thorough. Malware score should be 0.\n\n- **Score justification:** No malware or security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on a malware score of 0, which is justified given the code's purpose and content.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The code is a typical testing suite with no external data handling, no network activity, no embedded secrets, and no malicious logic. The risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations\n\n- The code is purely for testing estimator compatibility and correctness.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe, legitimate, and poses no security threat.",
