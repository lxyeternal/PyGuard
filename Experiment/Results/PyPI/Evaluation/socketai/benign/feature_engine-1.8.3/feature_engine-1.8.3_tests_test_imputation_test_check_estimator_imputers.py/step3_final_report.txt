{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for verifying the compatibility and correctness of various scikit-learn and feature_engine estimators and transformers, ensuring they work properly within pipelines and under different configurations.",
  "sources": "Static pandas DataFrame and Series objects used within test functions for data input.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or untrusted data sources; all data remains within local variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local variables into estimator methods (fit_transform, fit) and pipeline transformations, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs version checks and parameter adjustments based on class names, which are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward testing suite for ML estimators, operating solely on static, hardcoded data. It performs version-aware testing, parameter setting, and validation of fit-transform cycles within pipelines. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and purpose-driven, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for compatibility and correctness testing of ML estimators. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this assessment.",
