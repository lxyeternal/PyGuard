{
  "purpose": "Defines an SO(3) equivariant activation layer that transforms features via spherical grids, applies a normalized activation, and converts back.",
  "sources": "Input features tensor; internal grid transformation functions (to_grid, from_grid); activation function.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; purely tensor transformations within the process.",
  "flows": "Features -> grid_in.to_grid -> act -> grid_out.from_grid -> output features.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an SO(3) equivariant neural network layer using e3nn and PyTorch. It performs internal data transformations with no external communication, data leaks, or obfuscation. The activation is normalized, and the grid conversions are typical for such models. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores in the reports are consistent with the benign, scientific purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an SO(3) activation layer with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports' assessments are accurate; the slight elevation in risk score in one report (0.1) is unwarranted and should be adjusted to 0.0.",
