{
  "purpose": "This code provides a function for projecting input tensors onto a basis of functions, with options for different basis types, for use in mathematical or neural network models.",
  "sources": "Input tensor `x`, parameters `start`, `end`, `number`, `basis`, `cutoff`.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations include division, sine/cosine calculations, and tensor manipulations, but none are used in a malicious context. No data is sent over network, written to files, or accessed externally.",
  "flows": "Input `x` flows through various basis function calculations depending on `basis` parameter, with data transformations in each branch. No external data or untrusted sources influence the flow beyond input tensor `x`.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of mathematical functions appears standard and intended for mathematical basis projections.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basis projection function with multiple basis options, implementing well-known mathematical functions such as Gaussian, cosine, Fourier, Bessel, etc. It performs tensor computations without external data dependencies or system calls. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious data handling is present. The use of trigonometric and exponential functions is consistent with the stated purpose. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard mathematical utility for basis projections. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this module. It performs mathematical tensor operations intended for scientific computation.",
