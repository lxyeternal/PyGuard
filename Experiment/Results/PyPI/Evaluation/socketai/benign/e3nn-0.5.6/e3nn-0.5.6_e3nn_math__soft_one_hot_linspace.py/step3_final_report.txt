{
  "purpose": "Provides basis function projections (gaussian, cosine, smooth_finite, fourier, bessel) over a specified interval for scientific or ML applications.",
  "sources": "Input tensor x, start/end parameters, basis type, cutoff flag",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications",
  "flows": "Input tensor x is transformed via mathematical functions into basis representations",
  "anomalies": "Division by x in the bessel basis without explicit handling at x=0; potential for numerical instability",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard basis functions using torch and math libraries. While mathematically correct, the division by x in the bessel basis can cause runtime warnings or NaNs if x approaches zero. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The overall structure is straightforward and consistent with scientific utility code. The lack of explicit zero handling in the bessel basis is a minor robustness concern but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of basis functions with no malicious intent. The primary concern is potential numerical instability in the bessel basis at x=0, which could be exploited to cause runtime errors. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, with the caveat that handling x=0 explicitly would improve robustness.",
