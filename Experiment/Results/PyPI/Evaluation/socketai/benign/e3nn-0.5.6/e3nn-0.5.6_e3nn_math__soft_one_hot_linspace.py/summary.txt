  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of basis functions with no malicious intent. The primary concern is potential numerical instability in the bessel basis at x=0, which could be exploited to cause runtime errors. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, with the caveat that handling x=0 explicitly would improve robustness."
