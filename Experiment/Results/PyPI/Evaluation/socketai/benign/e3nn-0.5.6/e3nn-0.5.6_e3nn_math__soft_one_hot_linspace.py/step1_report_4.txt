{
  "purpose": "This code defines a function for projecting input data onto various basis functions, typically for use in mathematical or machine learning applications involving basis expansion techniques.",
  "sources": "The function reads input tensor `x` and parameters defining basis types and cutoff conditions; it also uses internal constants and parameters for basis calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, perform network communication, or manipulate system files. It performs tensor calculations locally without untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input tensor `x` through various basis functions depending on the specified parameters, resulting in transformed tensor outputs. No external data or untrusted sources influence the core transformation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or unusual code constructs are identified. Usage of mathematical functions appears standard. No hidden or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a tensor-based basis projection with support for multiple basis types, utilizing common mathematical operations such as exponentials, trigonometric functions, and Bessel functions. It handles input validation for cutoff parameter and basis choice. No external or network I/O, no suspicious code constructs, nor data leaks are evident. The implementation appears to be a standard mathematical utility function with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate mathematical utility for basis function projection. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes data locally and securely, with no indication of sabotage or malicious intent.",
