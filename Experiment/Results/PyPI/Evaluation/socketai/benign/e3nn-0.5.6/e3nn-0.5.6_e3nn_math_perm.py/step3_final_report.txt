  "purpose": "Mathematical utilities for permutation groups, including generation, composition, inversion, group validation, and representations, primarily for scientific and computational group theory purposes.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, internal computations, and imported modules (torch, e3nn.math, math, random). No external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file I/O, or network activity; computations are in-memory and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through permutation operations and tensor computations, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, mathematical, and uses standard libraries appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard permutation group operations such as validation, composition, inversion, random permutation generation, and group property checks. It utilizes 'random' for sampling permutations, which is typical in such contexts. The tensor operations via 'torch' and 'e3nn' are used solely for group representation purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external data leaks are present. The functions are deterministic aside from the randomness in permutation sampling, which is standard and not suspicious. Overall, the code is a legitimate mathematical utility with no malicious or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, purpose-driven implementation of permutation group utilities, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
