{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific functions from internal submodules and exposes them for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from internal modules: ._linalg, ._normalize_activation, ._soft_unit_step, ._soft_one_hot_linspace, ._reduce",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data handling present; imports are from local/internal modules",
  "flows": "Import statements gather functions, then re-export via __all__; no data flow or external data processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. Importing internal functions and exporting them is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific functions from internal modules and listing them in __all__ for module export. No external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code patterns. All functions seem to be mathematical or normalization utilities, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes internal functions for external use.",
