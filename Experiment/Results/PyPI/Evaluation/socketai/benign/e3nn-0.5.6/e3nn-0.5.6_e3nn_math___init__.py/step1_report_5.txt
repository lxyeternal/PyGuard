{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various functions from internal modules related to linear algebra, normalization, soft functions, and permutation reduction, then exposes them for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules such as ._linalg, ._normalize_activation, ._soft_unit_step, ._soft_one_hot_linspace, and ._reduce.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from internal modules and makes them publicly available; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and structurally standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Python module import and export operations. It imports specific functions from internal submodules and defines __all__ for exports, which is typical for Python packages. No input reading, data processing, or external communication is present. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer that consolidates internal function exports. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It appears safe and intended for normal library use.",
