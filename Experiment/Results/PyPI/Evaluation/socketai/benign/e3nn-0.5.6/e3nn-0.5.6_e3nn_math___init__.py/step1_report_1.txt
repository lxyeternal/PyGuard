  "purpose": "The code is importing functions from internal modules for mathematical and normalization operations, and defining an export list.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from internal modules within the same package.",
  "sinks": "Exports listed functions for external use.",
  "flows": "Import statements bring in functions, and the __all__ list exposes these functions for external modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__ module, importing specific functions from internal modules and defining the public API via __all__. All imports are from local modules, and the __all__ list exposes these functions for external use. No input/output handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The structure is typical for a Python package's initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply organizes and exports functions from internal modules for external use.",
