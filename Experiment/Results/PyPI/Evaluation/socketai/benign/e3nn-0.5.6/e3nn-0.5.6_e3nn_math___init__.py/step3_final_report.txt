  "purpose": "This module imports functions from internal submodules and exposes them via the __all__ list, serving as an API or initialization file for the package.",
  "sources": "Internal submodules such as ._linalg, ._normalize_activation, ._soft_unit_step, ._soft_one_hot_linspace, and ._reduce; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to files.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from internal modules and exposes them; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports functions from internal submodules and exposes them via __all__, a common pattern for package API definition. It contains no external input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard code with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization or API exposure module with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
