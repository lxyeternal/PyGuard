{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports and exposes functions related to linear algebra, normalization, soft functions, and permutations, likely for mathematical or machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (e.g., ._linalg, ._normalize_activation, ._soft_unit_step, ._soft_one_hot_linspace, ._reduce). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions; the code only imports and defines __all__ for module exports.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing functions and exposing them via __all__; no data processing, input/output, or external communication present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward, importing and exposing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from local modules and then defines __all__ to specify the public API. There are no input reads, no external data handling, and no suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution, network communication, or hardcoded secrets. The structure is typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely organizes and exposes functions for external use.",
