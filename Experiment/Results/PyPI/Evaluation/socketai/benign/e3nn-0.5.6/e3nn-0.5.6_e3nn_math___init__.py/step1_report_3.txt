{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports and re-exports specific functions from internal submodules related to linear algebra, normalization, soft thresholds, and reduction formulas.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (._linalg, ._normalize_activation, ._soft_unit_step, ._soft_one_hot_linspace, ._reduce). No external data input handling is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, network communication, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for a module re-export.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It is a typical pattern for Python packages to organize and control API exposure. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The functions imported are likely mathematical or utility functions based on their names, with no indication of malicious intent. There are no external inputs, data handling, or operations that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code is simple, clean, and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign module that re-exports functions from internal submodules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
