{
  "purpose": "Defines and manages global optimization default settings via functions that set and get configuration options.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only processes function parameters and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data externally or execute untrusted data; it only updates internal state.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists, as all data manipulations are internal and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes default optimization settings, allows updating these settings through a function, and retrieves current defaults. The functions perform simple validation and updates on a dictionary, with no external data fetching or dangerous operations. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and focused solely on internal state management.",
