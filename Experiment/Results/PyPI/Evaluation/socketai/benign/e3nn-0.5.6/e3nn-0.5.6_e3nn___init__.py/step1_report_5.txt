{
  "purpose": "Define and manage global default optimization settings for a Python module or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the _OPT_DEFAULTS dictionary during the get_optimization_defaults function and from kwargs in set_optimization_defaults.",
  "sinks": "The data in _OPT_DEFAULTS could be returned or modified, but there are no dangerous sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input via kwargs in set_optimization_defaults flows into updating _OPT_DEFAULTS; get_optimization_defaults returns a copy of _OPT_DEFAULTS.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard configuration management functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default optimization options in a dictionary, provides a function to set these options with validation, and a function to retrieve current defaults. No data leakage, insecure operations, or malicious behavior are evident. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling. The structure is straightforward and intended for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration management utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
