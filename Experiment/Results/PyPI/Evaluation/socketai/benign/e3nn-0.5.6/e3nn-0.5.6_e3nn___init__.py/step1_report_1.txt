{
  "purpose": "The code defines default optimization settings and provides functions to get and set these settings globally.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data sources or inputs; it only accesses internal default settings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or other effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting or retrieving the internal default settings, with no external data or command execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are present; the code is straightforward configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a dictionary of default optimization flags. It provides functions to modify and retrieve these flags with validation to prevent unknown options. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The structure and logic are standard for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to manage internal optimization settings without any malicious intent or security risks.",
