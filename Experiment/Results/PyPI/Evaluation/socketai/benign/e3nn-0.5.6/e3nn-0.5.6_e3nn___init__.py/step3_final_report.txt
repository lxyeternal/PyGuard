  "purpose": "Manage and validate global optimization settings for a software component.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the dictionary '_OPT_DEFAULTS' used within the functions.",
  "sinks": "The dictionary '_OPT_DEFAULTS' being updated in 'set_optimization_defaults' with validated keys.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs in 'set_optimization_defaults' flow into '_OPT_DEFAULTS' after validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no external data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a dictionary of default boolean options. It provides functions to set and get these options, with validation to prevent unknown keys. The code is static, does not perform network operations, code execution, or handle untrusted data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. Validation enhances safety but does not introduce vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no issues are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
