  "purpose": "Define and manage global optimization settings for a package or application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data to external systems or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the functions modify and retrieve a local dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (beyond version string), or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string and a dictionary of default optimization options. It provides functions to set and get these options, with validation to prevent unknown keys. There are no external inputs, network connections, or malicious constructs. The purpose appears to be configuration management. The code is straightforward and follows normal Python practices without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
