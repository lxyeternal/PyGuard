  "purpose": "Implementation of permutation group generation, tensor symmetry reduction, and basis transformation for mathematical and physical computations involving tensor symmetries.",
  "sources": "Input formulas (strings), dimension dictionaries, and standard libraries (itertools, torch, e3nn.math.perm); internal data flow within mathematical operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file I/O; computations are self-contained within mathematical functions.",
  "flows": "From input formulas and dimension info through permutation group generation, validation, and tensor basis computation, culminating in tensor transformation Q.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; code is transparent and mathematically consistent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate mathematical operations related to permutation groups and tensor symmetries, with validation checks ensuring correctness. No external communication or malicious behavior is present. The use of standard libraries and assertions indicates robustness. The code's purpose aligns with scientific computing, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of permutation group and tensor symmetry reduction, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (~0.1-0.2) scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
