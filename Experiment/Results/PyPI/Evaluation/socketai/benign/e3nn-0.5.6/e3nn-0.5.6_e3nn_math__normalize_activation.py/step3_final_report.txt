{
  "purpose": "The code computes the nth moment of a function applied to Gaussian noise and normalizes the function based on the second moment to produce a normalized version.",
  "sources": "Generates Gaussian noise data using torch.randn with a fixed seed for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or credential handling; data flows internally within the process.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Gaussian noise generation -> function application -> moment calculation -> normalization scaling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; uses fixed seed for reproducibility, which is standard practice in scientific computing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for statistical normalization, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The fixed seed ensures reproducibility but does not introduce security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk ~0.1) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for computing moments and normalizing functions, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
