{
  "purpose": "The code computes the moments of a given function with respect to a normal distribution and normalizes the function based on the second moment.",
  "sources": "Reads input data in the forward method (`x` parameter), generates random tensor `z` using `torch.randn`, and uses seed initialization for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "Returns the processed tensor from the function `f`. No direct data leaks or data sink anomalies are evident.",
  "flows": "Random tensor `z` generated in `moment()` as source, then passed through `f(z)`; in `normalize2mom`, input `x` flows into `f(x)` and possibly scaled by `self.cst`.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a fixed seed (`manual_seed(0)`) for reproducibility, which is common but may obscure randomness. No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors are present. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates the second moment of function `f` over a large normal sample, then uses this to normalize `f`. It employs standard PyTorch operations, with no dynamic code execution, no network communication, or data leakage points. The seed initialization is for deterministic results, typical in scientific computations. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward scientific utility for moment calculation and normalization, with no signs of malicious intent. It operates within expected parameters for such a purpose.",
