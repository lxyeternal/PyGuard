{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions and a class for computing moments of a function applied to random data and normalizing functions based on second moments.",
  "sources": "The code reads parameters from function inputs (f, n, dtype, device), and generates random data using torch.randn with a fixed seed for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. The only output is the processed tensor data from the function f.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> random data generation (with fixed seed) -> function f -> moment calculation -> normalization (scaling by cst).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of torch's random generator with a fixed seed is standard for reproducibility. No obfuscated code or suspicious language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a statistical utility for computing moments of a function applied to Gaussian noise and normalizes functions based on the second moment. It uses standard PyTorch features, including random number generation with a fixed seed to ensure reproducibility. The only potentially noteworthy point is the fixed seed for the generator, which is common for deterministic results, not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. All data flows are internal, and no external network activity or credential handling occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for statistical analysis and normalization within a machine learning context. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
