{
  "purpose": "Define a smooth approximation of the unit step function using custom autograd functions in PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Input tensor 'x' in forward and backward methods, read from the function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, files, or network; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input tensor 'x' flows into the forward method, which computes an exponential-based function, and the backward method computes gradients for backpropagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly implements mathematical functions using PyTorch's autograd mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom autograd function '_SoftUnitStep' implementing a smooth unit step via exponential functions. The 'soft_unit_step' wrapper applies this function. It includes docstrings with mathematical descriptions and a plotting example. No external calls, network access, or suspicious file/system operations are present. The code appears solely focused on mathematical computation within the PyTorch framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a mathematical implementation of a smooth unit step function with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
