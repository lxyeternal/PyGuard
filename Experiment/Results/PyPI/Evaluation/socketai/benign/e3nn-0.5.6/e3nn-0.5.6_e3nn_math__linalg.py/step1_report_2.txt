{
  "purpose": "The code implements mathematical functions for matrix operations, orthonormalization, and basis completion using PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Reads input tensors, particularly the 'original' tensor in 'orthonormalize' and 'complete_basis'. Uses torch functions and tensor operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present. No untrusted data being sent over network, written to files, or used in system calls.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed through tensor operations; no untrusted data flows to external systems or unsafe functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior detected. The code performs standard mathematical operations with clear intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for combining matrices, orthonormalizing vectors, and completing a basis set, all using PyTorch tensor operations. There are no network calls, file operations, or environment variable usages. The code includes assertions on tensor dimensions and uses small epsilon values for numerical stability. All operations are mathematical and consistent with common tensor processing routines. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of matrix and vector operations for linear algebra tasks. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious behavior. It is safe and intended for mathematical processing within PyTorch.",
