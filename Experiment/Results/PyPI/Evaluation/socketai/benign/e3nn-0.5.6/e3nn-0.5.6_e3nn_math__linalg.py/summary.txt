  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of mathematical routines with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and the obfuscation score is zero, reflecting code clarity. The slight elevation in one report's security risk score to 0.1 appears unwarranted and should be lowered to 0 for consistency."
