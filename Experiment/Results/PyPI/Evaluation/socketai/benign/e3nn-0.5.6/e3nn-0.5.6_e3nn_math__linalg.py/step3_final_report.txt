  "purpose": "Implementation of linear algebra routines including block diagonal concatenation, orthonormalization, and basis completion using PyTorch tensors.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs provided to functions; no external data sources or environment variables accessed.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file I/O; data remains within tensor operations.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow through mathematical routines to produce outputs; no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard linear algebra operations with proper assertions and numerical stability measures. It uses PyTorch's tensor operations and JIT scripting for performance. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are mathematically sound and straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of mathematical routines with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and the obfuscation score is zero, reflecting code clarity. The slight elevation in one report's security risk score to 0.1 appears unwarranted and should be lowered to 0 for consistency.",
