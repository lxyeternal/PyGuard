  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the described logic with the provided code, and assess the validity of their conclusions, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign documentation processor selector with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns well with the code. The code only manipulates strings and delegates processing; no external data transfer or malicious code is present.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly higher securityRisk (0.1). The confidence is 0.9.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or obfuscation. The only concern is that it relies on external processors, which could be malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code itself is safe; the only potential risk is from external dependencies, which is acknowledged. The low securityRisk score is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a dispatcher delegating to external processor classes; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** External classes could be malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is justified. The code's delegation to external classes is a potential vector if those classes are malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with a focus on delegation.\n- **Findings:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The low risk reflects the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code delegates processing via dynamic attribute access (`getattr`). No malicious code detected.\n- **Findings:** The main concern is that if imported processors are malicious, they could execute malicious code during `_process`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code itself is safe, but the potential risk depends on external modules. The report correctly notes this and assigns a low securityRisk.\n- **Verdict:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to reliance on external modules.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor concern about external dependencies, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a simple, transparent dispatcher that delegates documentation processing based on string indicators. It does not contain any malicious or obfuscated logic. The potential security concern hinges on the safety of external modules, which are assumed to be safe here. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.  \n- The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.  \n- The security risk score could be marginally increased if the external modules are untrusted, but based solely on this code, 0.1-0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1–0.2. The code is safe, with minimal external dependency risk.",
