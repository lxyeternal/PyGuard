{
  "purpose": "Defines a SmartProcessor class that selects between GoogleProcessor, PydocmdProcessor, or SphinxProcessor based on docstring content for documentation processing.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class attribute definitions, method calls on objects, string checks, and string replacements.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on processor objects (_process), string operations (replace), and checks (check_docstring_format).",
  "flows": "Checks docstring content for specific indicators, then invokes corresponding processor's _process method based on format detection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; the code appears straightforward for a documentation processor.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines a dataclass with three processor instances, and processes modules by inspecting their docstrings. It determines the format by specific indicators and calls appropriate processing methods. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration. It is a typical plugin-like structure for documentation handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a documentation format selector. It processes docstrings with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. There are no security risks or malware indicators present.",
