  "purpose": "Defines interface classes for a plugin-based documentation framework, including loaders, resolvers, processors, renderers, servers, builders, and source linkers.",
  "sources": "No untrusted data sources; only import statements and method signatures with no runtime data handling.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess module imported and used only in method signatures for server management interfaces; no actual subprocess execution occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely structural interface definitions without data processing or execution.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard interface and class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract classes and interface definitions for a plugin system. The subprocess module is imported and referenced only in method signatures, such as start_server() and reload_server(), but no subprocess calls or executions are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The minimal use of subprocess in interface signatures is typical for server management plugins and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of interface definitions for a documentation plugin system. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The subprocess references are only in method signatures and do not pose a risk unless subclasses implement malicious behavior, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
