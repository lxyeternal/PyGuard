{
  "purpose": "This module defines abstract interfaces and base classes for a documentation generation framework, including plugin, resolver, renderer, and server interfaces.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read directly by the code. The only potential input is through the plugin methods which are meant to be implemented elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present within this code; it primarily defines interfaces and class structures.",
  "flows": "There are no executable data flows or untrusted data processing within this code; it only defines abstract methods and class structures for plugin implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code adheres to standard Python practices for defining abstract base classes and plugin interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class and interface definitions intended for a documentation system. It imports standard modules and external modules, and defines abstract methods with no implementation or executable code that could be malicious. The presence of the subprocess module is limited to server control interfaces, and no subprocess calls are made here. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The overall structure is typical for plugin architecture, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of interface definitions for a documentation plugin framework. It contains no executable malicious code, no data leakage mechanisms, and no suspicious behaviors. The only external dependencies are for type annotations and documentation, which are standard and safe.",
