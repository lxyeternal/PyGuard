  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that the code is only interface definitions, with no data reading or untrusted sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or system impacts; subprocess management is only in interface signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely structural code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar findings: interface definitions, no runtime logic, no data leaks.\n- No anomalies or malicious behaviors.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Emphasizes that subprocess is only used in interface signatures, no execution occurs here.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: interface definitions, no execution, no malicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Highlights that subprocess calls are only in interface signatures, no actual execution here.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly identify that there is no active malicious code. The subprocess module is only used in method signatures within interfaces, not executed here.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Security Risk:** Given that actual implementations are not included, and only interface signatures are provided, the potential for malicious activity is minimal. The minor security risk score reflects that malicious activity could occur if subclasses misuse subprocess calls, but as-is, the code is safe.\n\n### My Final Estimations:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, standard interface definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slight potential if subclasses implement malicious behavior, but unlikely based on this code alone.\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is purely structural, defining interfaces for a plugin-based documentation system. The use of `subprocess` in method signatures does not pose a risk by itself; actual execution depends on subclass implementations. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe and does not pose a security threat in its current form.",
