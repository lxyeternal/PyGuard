  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines interface classes for a documentation framework; no input reading or untrusted data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data leaks or system impacts; subprocess management is only in interface signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious behaviors; standard interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable, given the minimal potential for misuse.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard interface definitions with no runtime logic.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the same structure; subprocess is only in method signatures.\n- No dynamic code execution or malicious behaviors.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion; no executable code or data leaks.\n- Subprocess only in interface signatures.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis; subprocess calls are only in interface signatures.\n- No evidence of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree there is no evidence of malware. The subprocess module is only used in method signatures for server control, which is standard for plugin interface definitions.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given that the code only defines interfaces and does not execute any code or handle data directly, the risk score should be very low, close to 0. The slight increase to 0.1 or 0.2 in some reports seems to reflect cautiousness but is not justified by the code itself.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — minimal risk; the only potential concern is the subprocess interface, which is only in method signatures, not actual execution.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard set of interface definitions for a plugin-based documentation system. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk within this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Any actual malicious activity would depend on the implementation of these interfaces, not their definitions. Proper security review should include the implementations that extend these interfaces.",
