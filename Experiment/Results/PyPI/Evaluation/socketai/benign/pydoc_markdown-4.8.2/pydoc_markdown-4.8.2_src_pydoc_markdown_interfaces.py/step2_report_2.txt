  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Interface definitions for a documentation framework.\n- Sources: No untrusted data sources; only imports.\n- Sinks: Subprocess management in server interface, but only as method signatures.\n- Flows: No runtime data flow; purely structural.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard interface code, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malware, obfuscated code, or significant security risk.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (slightly elevated due to subprocess interface, but it's only interface, not execution)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the structural nature of the code.\n- No runtime logic or data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe, well-structured interface code.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the same pattern: interface definitions, no executable logic.\n- Subprocess used only in method signatures.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No malware or security risks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous, with no executable code.\n- Subprocess in interface methods, but no actual execution.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malware.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar findings: interface definitions, no actual subprocess calls.\n- The only concern is the potential for malicious subclasses to misuse subprocess, but as-is, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that this code is purely interface and class definitions for a plugin-based documentation system.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent within this code. The subprocess module is only used in method signatures, not in actual execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code detected.\n- **Security Risks:** The only minor concern relates to the subprocess interface, which could be exploited if subclasses implement malicious behavior. However, as provided, the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, due to subprocess interface potential, but not actual risk in the code itself)\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\nThis code is a safe, standard set of interface definitions with no malicious content. The only caution is that actual security depends on how subclasses implement the subprocess methods, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
