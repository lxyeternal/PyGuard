{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package data and submodules.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and accesses the '__path__' variable, which is a standard module attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data is used or passed to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only modifies '__path__' using a standard library function.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a common pattern for namespace packages; no unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls its 'extend_path' method to modify '__path__'. This pattern is typical in namespace packages to aggregate multiple directories. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions as intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for namespace package extension and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
