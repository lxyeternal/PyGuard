{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resource discovery",
  "sources": "The built-in 'pkgutil' module imported via __import__",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only modifies __path__",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import and extension of __path__, which is common in namespace packages but not suspicious by itself",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends the __path__ variable, which is a standard technique for namespace packages in Python. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No suspicious data handling or external communications are involved. This pattern is typical in package initialization or namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a common pattern for handling namespace packages in Python. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and legitimate.",
