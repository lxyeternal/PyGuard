  "purpose": "Support namespace packages by extending the __path__ variable using pkgutil's extend_path function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and dynamically imports 'pkgutil' to call 'extend_path'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks are present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call 'extend_path' with __path__ and __name__ -> assign back to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends __path__ for namespace package support, a common Python pattern. No untrusted input, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The pattern is well-known and benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or security issues are identified. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
