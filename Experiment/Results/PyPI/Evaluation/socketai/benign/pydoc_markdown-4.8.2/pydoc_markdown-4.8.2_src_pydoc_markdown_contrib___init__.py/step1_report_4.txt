  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package namespace handling, enabling namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and accesses __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to modify __path__, but does not process external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package extension; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the __path__ variable for the current package, which is typical for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or untrusted input handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code is a standard pattern for package namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard mechanism for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
