  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to extend __path__",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leakage or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend __path__ -> assign back to __path__",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and extension of __path__ is common in namespace packages, no suspicious activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' to extend the module's __path__, which is a standard practice in Python namespace packages. This operation is safe and does not involve handling untrusted input or executing untrusted code. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal, straightforward, and serves a legitimate purpose related to package management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package pattern and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
