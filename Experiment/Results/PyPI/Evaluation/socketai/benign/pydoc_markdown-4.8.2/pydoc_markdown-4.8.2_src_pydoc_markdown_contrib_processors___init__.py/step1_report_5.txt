{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkgutil') statement, which dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code performs a module import and a method call",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a standard Python pattern for namespace package extension",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically, then calls 'extend_path' on the __path__ variable, which is typically used for namespace package support. This is a common pattern and does not involve any hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or unusual code behavior. There are no suspicious data flows or external communications. The code is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for extending namespace package paths. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
