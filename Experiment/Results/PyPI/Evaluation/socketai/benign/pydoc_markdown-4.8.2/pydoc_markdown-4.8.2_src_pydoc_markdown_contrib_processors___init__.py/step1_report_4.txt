  "purpose": "Extend the module search path using pkgutil's extend_path for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module; use of '__path__' and '__name__' variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leak or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code reads the __path__ and __name__ variables and extends the search path accordingly; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a standard namespace package extension without any hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable, a common practice for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no interaction with external or untrusted data sources. The code is minimal and straightforward, indicating standard behavior rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet implements a common pattern for namespace packages with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
