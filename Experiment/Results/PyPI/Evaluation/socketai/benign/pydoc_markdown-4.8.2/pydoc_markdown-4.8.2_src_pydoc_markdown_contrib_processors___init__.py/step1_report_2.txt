  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code simply modifies a package attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import and method invocation, but this is standard for namespace package support; no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls its 'extend_path' function to modify the __path__ variable, which is a common practice for supporting namespace packages. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The use of __import__ and extend_path is standard and not suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a typical pattern for supporting namespace packages and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
