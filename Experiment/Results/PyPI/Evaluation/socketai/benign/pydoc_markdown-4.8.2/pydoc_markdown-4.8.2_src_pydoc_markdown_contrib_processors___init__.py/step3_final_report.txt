  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending the module search path using pkgutil's extend_path.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' and usage of __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data handling, network activity, or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path with __path__ and __name__ -> assign result back to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for namespace package support, straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ for namespace package support, a common and safe pattern in Python. No malicious activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or external communications are present. The code is minimal, clear, and aligns with best practices. No suspicious behaviors or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for namespace package extension. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
