  "conclusion": "The source code is not malicious; it is a standard framework with a known security concern regarding execution of external commands in hooks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.4 to 0.45 due to subprocess usage. Proper validation of hook commands can mitigate this risk."
