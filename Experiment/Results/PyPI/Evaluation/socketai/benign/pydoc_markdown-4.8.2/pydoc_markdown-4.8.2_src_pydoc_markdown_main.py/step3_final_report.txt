  "purpose": "CLI tool for generating, rendering, and serving Python API documentation using pydoc-markdown, with configuration management and optional server operation.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, command-line arguments, filesystem (creating configs and static files), subprocesses (server), webbrowser (opening URLs), logging.",
  "sinks": "File creation (config, static files), subprocess calls (server management), webbrowser invocation, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "User inputs and CLI options influence configuration loading, file operations, server process management, and rendering actions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity beyond opening URLs, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper around pydoc-markdown, handling configuration, rendering, server management, and bootstrap file creation. It uses well-known libraries and performs typical file and process operations. No malicious or sabotage indicators are present. The features such as opening a browser and creating static configs are legitimate for such tools. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate documentation CLI tool with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate given its functionality. It is safe to use in production environments.",
