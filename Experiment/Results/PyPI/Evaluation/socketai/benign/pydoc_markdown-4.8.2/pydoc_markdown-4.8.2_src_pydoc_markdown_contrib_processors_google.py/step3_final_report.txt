  "purpose": "Converts Google-style and PEP 257-style docstrings into Markdown format for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads docstring content from in-memory strings within the 'node' objects, specifically 'node.docstring.content'.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'node.docstring.content' in memory; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Reads the original docstring content, processes it with regex patterns, and updates the content with formatted Markdown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard regex and string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward regex-based parsing of docstring sections, converting Google and PEP 257 styles into Markdown. It operates solely on in-memory data, with no external system calls, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. The logic is clear, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-built utility for formatting docstrings into Markdown. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
