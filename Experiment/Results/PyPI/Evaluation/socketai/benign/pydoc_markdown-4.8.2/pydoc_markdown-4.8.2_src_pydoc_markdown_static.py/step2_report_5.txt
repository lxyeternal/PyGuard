  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy and consistency.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static, hardcoded configuration strings.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to serve as static templates for documentation tools.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any code execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n- The configuration strings are static and appear to be standard templates.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Error or flaw in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign static configuration data.\n- No report claims any dynamic or unsafe behavior, which aligns with the code content.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting high certainty given the static nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there is no dynamic code, no external input handling, and no network or system calls, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- Malware score is correctly 0; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated score is correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- The overall security risk is negligible, justifying a score of 0.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only minor point is the presence of URLs and file paths within the YAML configurations, but these are standard for documentation setups and do not indicate malicious activity.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the static nature of the code means no attack surface.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, static configuration data with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**  \n- The code is entirely safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and risk.  \n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely static configuration data.",
