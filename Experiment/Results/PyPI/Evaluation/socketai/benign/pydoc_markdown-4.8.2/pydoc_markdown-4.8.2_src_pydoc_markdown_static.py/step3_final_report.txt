  "purpose": "Static configuration templates for documentation tools (MkDocs, Hugo, Docusaurus, Read the Docs).",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string variables containing YAML and JSON configuration snippets.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data, user input, or external data sources; no data sinks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of configuration strings; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; standard license comments and URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string variables defining configuration templates for various documentation tools. There are no functions, dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or external data processing. The configuration snippets include URLs and file paths typical for documentation setups. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is purely static configuration data, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores in all reports are 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign static configuration data with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
