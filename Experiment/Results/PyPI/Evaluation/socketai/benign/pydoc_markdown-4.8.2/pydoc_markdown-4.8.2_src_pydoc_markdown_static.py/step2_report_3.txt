  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of static string variables defining configuration templates for documentation tools (mkdocs, hugo, docusaurus, readthedocs, etc.).\n- No functions, dynamic code, input processing, or external data handling is present.\n- The data is hardcoded, with no signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n- URLs and file paths included are typical for documentation projects and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are evident.\n- The license comments are standard and do not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is static configuration data, with no vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or mistakes are evident. The report's assessments that the code is benign and static are correct.\n\n- **Scores suggested?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with security risk also at 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Correctly identifies the code as static configuration templates.  \n- No issues, no malware, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same conclusion; static data, no dynamic behavior.  \n- Correctly notes no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Recognizes URLs in configuration but deems them benign.  \n- No dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Confirms static configuration, no external input or code execution.  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same conclusion: static data, benign configuration snippets.  \n- No malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent with the code content.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n- No need to adjust scores; they reflect the benign nature well.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is purely static configuration data with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
