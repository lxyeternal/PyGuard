  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code consists solely of static, hardcoded configuration strings for documentation tools.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, network operations, or file manipulations are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform any system calls or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- URLs and file paths included in the configurations are standard for documentation setups and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The license comments are standard and do not suggest malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The code's purpose is purely to provide default configuration templates.\n- There are no functions, no data flows from sources to sinks, and no dynamic behavior.\n- The presence of URLs or paths within configurations is typical and not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscated code, or secret exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Any adjustments needed?**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is entirely benign, static configuration data with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- It poses no security risk.\n- The analysis and scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed assessments provided. The code is safe and intended solely for static configuration purposes.",
