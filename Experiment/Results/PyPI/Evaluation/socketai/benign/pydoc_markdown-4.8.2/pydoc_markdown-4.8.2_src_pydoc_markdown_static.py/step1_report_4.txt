{
  "purpose": "This code defines default configuration templates for various documentation and static site generators (e.g., MkDocs, Hugo, Docusaurus, Read the Docs) with no apparent dynamic or external input processing.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read or processed. The code contains static string definitions for configuration files and documentation setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present. The code does not perform any output operations, network activity, or system calls.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the code is purely static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with standard licensing comments and static configuration strings. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are evident. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of license comments and several multiline string variables defining default configuration templates for different documentation tools. There are no functions, input handling, or execution logic. All content is static, and the data appears to be generic configuration snippets. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause harm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static configuration data for documentation tools. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
