      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be lowered to 0, as the code performs only standard configuration tasks."
