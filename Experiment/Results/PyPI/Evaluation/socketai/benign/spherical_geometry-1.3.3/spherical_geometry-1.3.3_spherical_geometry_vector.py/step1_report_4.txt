{
  "purpose": "The module provides vector operations related to spherical geometry, including conversions between coordinate systems, normalization, rotation, and projection.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as lon, lat, x, y, z, and arrays passed to functions like normalize_vector and equal_area_proj.",
  "sinks": "The code computes and returns vectors or transformed coordinates; it does not write data externally or send data over networks.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters is processed through mathematical transformations and returned as outputs; no external data flow or untrusted sink involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. Usage of an optional C extension (math_util) appears to optimize normalization but is not malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard vector and coordinate transformations used in spherical geometry. It conditionally uses a C extension for performance. The functions handle array inputs properly, with no signs of hidden or malicious behavior. The presence of mathematical functions and coordinate conversions is typical for such modules. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific utility library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard spherical geometry utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily performs mathematical transformations for coordinate conversions and vector operations. No malicious or sabotage features are detected.",
