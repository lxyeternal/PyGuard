{
  "purpose": "Provides vector operations for spherical geometry, including coordinate conversions, normalization, and rotations.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy for array and mathematical operations; imports math_util for normalization if available.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; functions process provided data without external output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (coordinates, vectors) flow through transformation functions (e.g., lonlat_to_vector, normalize_vector, rotate_around) to produce processed vector outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. The only optional import (math_util) is used for normalization if available; no malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard vector operations for spherical coordinate transformations, normalization, and rotations. It includes safe mathematical operations and uses numpy for array processing. The optional import of math_util could suggest optimized functions, but its absence does not introduce malicious behavior. There are no network operations, file I/O, or other side effects. All functions perform mathematical calculations consistent with their descriptions. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured library for spherical vector mathematics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the optional use of an external 'math_util' module for normalization, which is not malicious in itself.",
