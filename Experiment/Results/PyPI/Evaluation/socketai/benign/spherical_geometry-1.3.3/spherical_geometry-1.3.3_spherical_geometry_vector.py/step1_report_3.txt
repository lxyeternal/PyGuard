{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for vector operations on spherical coordinates, including conversions between longitude/latitude and vectors, normalization, rotation, and projection.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as lon, lat, x, y, z, and numpy arrays; uses numpy for array operations.",
  "sinks": "Returns computed vectors, angles, or transformed coordinates; no data leakage or sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (source) flow through mathematical computations and functions, resulting in outputs such as vectors, angles, or projections; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code uses conditional import for optional C extensions, but this is common for performance optimization and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard mathematical operations for spherical vector conversions, rotations, normalization, and projections. It uses numpy for numerical computations, includes an optional C extension for normalization, and contains no obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or system modification routines are present. The code appears to be a utility module for geometric calculations related to spherical geometry.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a straightforward, mathematically-oriented utility for spherical vector operations. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only notable aspect is the optional C extension for normalization, which is benign. Overall, it is safe and does not pose security threats.",
