{
  "purpose": "The module provides operations for handling vectors on a sphere, including conversions between coordinate systems, normalization, rotation, and projections, likely for astronomical or geospatial applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'lon', 'lat', 'xyz', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'theta', and 'points'. It also imports numpy and an optional local math_util module.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical computations only; there are no explicit data sinks like network calls, file writes, or system modifications within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through mathematical operations (e.g., conversions, normalization, rotations) and returns processed data. No untrusted external data sources or external data sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard mathematical operations and numpy functions. The optional import of math_util is only for performance optimization and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or code injection is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric operations related to vectors on a sphere, such as coordinate conversions, vector normalization, rotation around an arbitrary axis, and equal-area projections. It uses numpy for array computations, with an optional C-accelerated function for normalization. No network, file, or system commands are present. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage within this implementation. The structure and functions are straightforward, aligned with common mathematical procedures, and do not contain any suspicious or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of spherical vector operations for computational or visualization purposes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code segment. It is safe to use from a security standpoint.",
