  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for spherical geometry, including coordinate conversions, vector normalization, and rotation operations.",
  "sources": "Input longitude and latitude values, vectors for normalization and rotation, optional import of 'math_util' for normalization.",
  "sinks": "Outputs converted longitude/latitude, normalized vectors, rotated vectors; no data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates or vectors are processed through mathematical functions; optional 'math_util' may optimize normalization but does not alter data flow maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Use of optional external 'math_util' module for normalization; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spherical geometry calculations with clear, well-documented functions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The optional 'math_util' import is benign and used for performance optimization. The functions handle data inputs and produce coordinate or vector outputs without external side effects. No network, file, or system modification code is present. The minimal security risk stems from the optional dependency, but it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for spherical vector operations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal risk score (0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
