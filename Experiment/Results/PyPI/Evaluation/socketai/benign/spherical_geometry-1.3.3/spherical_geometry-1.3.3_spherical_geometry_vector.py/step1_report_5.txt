{
  "purpose": "Provides vector operations for spherical geometry, including conversions between spherical coordinates and Cartesian vectors, normalization, rotation, and map projections.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (e.g., lon, lat, vectors) and numpy arrays. No external or untrusted sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Outputs computed vectors, coordinate conversions, and rotated vectors. No sensitive data leaks or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates (lon, lat, vectors) -> computations (conversion, normalization, rotation) -> output vectors and coordinate pairs. No data flows to untrusted sources or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; functions perform standard mathematical transformations. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard spherical geometry operations using numpy, including coordinate transformations, vector normalization, rotation around axes, and map projections. Usage of a conditional C extension for normalization suggests optimization but is not suspicious. No external data fetches, network activity, or malicious patterns found. The code strictly performs mathematical computations with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of spherical vector operations and projections. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The overall security risk score is very low.",
