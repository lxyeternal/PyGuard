{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for managing and analyzing polygons on the sphere, including creation, intersection, union, and visualization, primarily for geospatial or astronomical applications.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from input parameters such as points arrays, longitude/latitude arrays, and file paths for WCS and FITS files. It also reads external WCS and FITS data via astropy if specified.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions may send data to external systems if visualization methods are invoked with plotting libraries. External libraries like astropy are used for file and WCS handling, but no data leaks or external network connections are explicitly present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (points, lon/lat, file paths) into conversion and geometric processing functions; no untrusted data is transmitted externally; functions like 'draw' send data to plotting interfaces, not external servers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code uses external libraries, but no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious data transmission are evident. The code is well-structured and focused on geospatial computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for spherical polygons, including creation from coordinates, WCS, cone, or convex hull, with functions for geometric operations such as intersection, union, inversion, and visualization. It uses external libraries like numpy and astropy, but all operations are consistent with geospatial analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of external libraries appears appropriate and safe. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or misleading operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for spherical polygon management and visualization, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard external libraries and performs typical geometric computations without suspicious side effects.",
