  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; only static assignments and imports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports type annotations, then sets version variables with fixed string and tuple values. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. No secrets or credentials are included. The code is standard for version management in Python projects and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version information setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
