  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version management script for a Python package.\n- It conditionally imports typing constructs for type hints, which is a common pattern.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples, with no external input, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no obfuscation, no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports agree that the code is static, benign, and typical for package versioning.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify the code as standard, auto-generated, and safe.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports give 0, which is accurate.\n  - **Malware:** All reports give 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n  - **Security Risk:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk. The code is static and has no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports are cautious and based on static analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, auto-generated version declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
