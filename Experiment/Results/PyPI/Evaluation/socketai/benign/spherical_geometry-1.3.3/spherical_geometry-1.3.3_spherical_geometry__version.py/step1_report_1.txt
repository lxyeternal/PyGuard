{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version tracking and type checking.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string and tuple assignments, which are hardcoded in the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned directly from hardcoded values; there are no flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of version information. It includes a conditional import for type checking, which is standard practice. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The purpose appears to be for version metadata management, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply assigns version information to variables, typical for package metadata.",
