  "purpose": "Define version information for a package generated by setuptools_scm, used for version control and package management.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, derived from the package's versioning system.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; version variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code; straightforward version assignment with conditional typing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing constructs when TYPE_CHECKING is True, which is standard for type hints. The main logic assigns version information as static strings and tuples, avoiding any dynamic or external data sources. No code injections, obfuscated elements, or malicious logic are present. The code's purpose is solely to define version metadata for the package.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, standard version declaration code with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
