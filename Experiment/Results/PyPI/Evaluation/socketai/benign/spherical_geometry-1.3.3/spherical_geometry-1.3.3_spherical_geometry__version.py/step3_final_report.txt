{
  "purpose": "The code defines static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, with conditional type hint imports.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples; conditional import for TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version metadata module with conditional type hint imports. It contains no dynamic execution, external data, or malicious constructs. All signals indicate benign, standard practice code. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or obfuscation are present, and the code does not process untrusted input or perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and standard for version management. The reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
