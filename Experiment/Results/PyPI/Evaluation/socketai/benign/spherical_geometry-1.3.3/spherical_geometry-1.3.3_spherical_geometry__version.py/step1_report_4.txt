{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage package versioning information.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples; conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or outputs that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; simple variable assignments with static values.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard version definition pattern with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The TYPE_CHECKING block is typical for type hints and does not execute at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal, auto-generated version info module. It uses conditional imports for type hinting and assigns static version values. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. It follows a common pattern for Python package version management. No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard version definition module generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
