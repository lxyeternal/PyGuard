  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the underlying code to ensure consistency, correctness, and to identify any potential issues.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module for a Python package.\n- It defines version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with static values.\n- It includes a conditional import for type annotations (`TYPE_CHECKING`), which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external data sources are involved.\n- The purpose is solely for package metadata management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and benign. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code are present.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic?**  \n  **No.** The reports consistently interpret the code as benign, standard, and without security risks. They correctly note the absence of data flows from untrusted sources, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The **malware scores** are all 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The **security risk scores** are 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The **confidence levels** are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Potential points of challenge:\n- Since the code is auto-generated and static, there are no dynamic behaviors to scrutinize.\n- The reports do not mention the purpose of the `TYPE_CHECKING` block explicitly, but it is a common pattern and not suspicious.\n- No assumptions are made about external inputs or data flows, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\nGiven the code and reports, I concur with the assigned scores. The code is a standard, benign version metadata module with no security concerns.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and carries no security risks.",
