  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for package versioning and type checking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; import statements within TYPE_CHECKING condition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version variables from hardcoded strings; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard versioning pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version variables for package metadata, with conditional type checking imports. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks or malicious behavior are evident. The variables are statically assigned, and no suspicious operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version information setup for a Python package. No malicious intent, no security risks detected.",
