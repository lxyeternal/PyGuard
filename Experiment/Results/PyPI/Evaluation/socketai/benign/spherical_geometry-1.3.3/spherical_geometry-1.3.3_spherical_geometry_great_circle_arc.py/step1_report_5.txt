  "purpose": "This module provides functions for computing properties related to great circle arcs on a sphere, such as length, intersection, angle, midpoint, and interpolation.",
  "sources": "Reads include numpy functions for numerical calculations, and optional import of 'spherical_geometry.math_util' if available.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy for calculations; no apparent data sinks or external communication in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input points (A, B, C, D) through geometric computations to results like intersections, lengths, angles, etc. No untrusted external data sources or outputs observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of try-except for optional C extension import is standard. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometric calculations for spherical geometry, leveraging numpy for numerical stability and optional C extensions for speed. Functions are well-structured, with clear source and sink points for data flow, primarily involving vector calculations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or sabotage mechanisms. The code's use of optional C modules is standard for performance optimization. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or hidden backdoors are evident. The functions operate purely within mathematical computation space, with no external system interaction or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of spherical geometry functions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is intended for geometric computations and does not contain any malicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities based on the provided source.",
