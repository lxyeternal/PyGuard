{
  "purpose": "A spherical geometry library providing functions for calculating great circle arc properties such as length, intersection, angle, and midpoint, primarily for scientific and geospatial computations.",
  "sources": "Input points A, B, C, D provided as triples or Nx3 arrays; data is used internally for mathematical calculations without external data or network access.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or data leaks; computations are self-contained within the module.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input points through mathematical functions (cross products, dot products, normalization) to produce geometric results like intersections, lengths, and angles.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of optional C extensions for performance is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard scientific library implementing spherical geometry functions. It uses numpy for numerical operations, with fallbacks for C-accelerated functions. Error handling and normalization are properly managed. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The optional C modules are performance optimizations, not indicators of malicious intent. The code's logic is straightforward, and no obfuscation or sabotage patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign scientific library for spherical geometry calculations. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
