{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for computing properties related to great circle arcs on the sphere, including intersection, length, angle, midpoint, and interpolation.",
  "sources": "Reads input points and vectors from function parameters, mainly via numpy arrays and broadcasting. Uses imports from external spherical_geometry.vector and optional math_util.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include computed geometric points and intersection data; no data sinks or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input points (A, B, C, D) flow into functions like intersection, length, angle, etc., which process them via vector calculations and return results. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere; all processing is contained.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network operations. Use of try-except for optional C-extensions appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a mathematical and geometric library focused on spherical geometry calculations. It imports third-party numpy and local vector functions, with optional C-extensions for performance. The functions implement standard mathematical operations for sphere geometry, with fallback implementations where C-extensions are unavailable. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system tampering, are present. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the use of optional C-extensions for performance, which is common in scientific Python code. The code handles input normalization, vector operations, and intersection calculations securely and with standard error handling. There are no anomalous or suspicious code paths, and no indication of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific computing library for spherical geometry. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured, with fallbacks and error handling, and contains no signs of sabotage or supply chain attacks.",
