{
  "purpose": "The code aims to configure and customize the display of test headers and version information for specific Python packages during testing.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest_astropy_header.display', 'spherical_geometry.__version__', and commented instructions for modifying package display lists.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks. The code primarily sets variables and modifies dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to variables, and modifications to dictionaries are made based on package presence. No untrusted data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, with exception handling for imports and dictionary modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific modules and handles ImportError gracefully, which is standard practice. It sets up two dictionaries for reporting package versions during testing. The commented instructions suggest manual customization, but these do not affect runtime behavior. No hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or obfuscated code are present. The overall structure is typical for test configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for testing environments. It performs standard import handling and dictionary modifications without any malicious intent or security risks.",
