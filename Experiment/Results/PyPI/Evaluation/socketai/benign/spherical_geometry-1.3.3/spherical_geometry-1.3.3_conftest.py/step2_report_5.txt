  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the code's security posture, potential issues, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code performs conditional imports with exception handling.\n- It modifies dictionaries (`PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES`, `TESTED_VERSIONS`) to configure test environment display.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The logic is straightforward and typical for test setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code initializes testing metadata.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard import and dictionary modifications.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identified as benign, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the benign nature. It might be more appropriate to set it to 0, considering no vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; configuration for test headers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; standard exception handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- Similar to previous; standard setup code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- Same pattern; straightforward import and dictionary modifications.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- Similar to others; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in Report 1 (0.1). Given the code's benign nature, this should be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n\n- **Adjust the securityRisk score in Report 1 from 0.1 to 0.**  \n  The code is standard test configuration code with no vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0** across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe test setup script with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are mostly accurate, except for the minor security risk in Report 1, which should be lowered to zero.",
