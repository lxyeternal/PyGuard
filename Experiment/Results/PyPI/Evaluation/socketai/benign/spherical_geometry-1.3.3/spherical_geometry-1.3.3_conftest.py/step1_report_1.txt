  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures testing environment variables for Python packages, particularly for displaying package version information during tests.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest_astropy_header.display' and 'spherical_geometry'; reads the 'version' attribute from 'spherical_geometry' module.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES dictionary; updates the TESTED_VERSIONS dictionary.",
  "flows": "Imports data from external modules, then conditionally updates dictionaries with package info and version data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external network connections or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports with exception handling, then modifies global dictionaries for testing metadata. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious code, or unusual behavior. The logic is straightforward and typical for test configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup snippet used for reporting package versions during testing. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
