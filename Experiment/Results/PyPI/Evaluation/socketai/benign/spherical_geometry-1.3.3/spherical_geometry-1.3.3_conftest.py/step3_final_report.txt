  "purpose": "Setup for test environment configuration, managing module version reporting and display.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports of 'pytest_astropy_header.display' and 'spherical_geometry' module version.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary modifications to 'PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES' and 'TESTED_VERSIONS'. No untrusted data flow or external sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Import attempts → exception handling → dictionary updates; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and dictionary manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import with exception handling, sets up dictionaries for test reporting, and modifies these dictionaries. It reads version info from a module, defaulting to 'unknown'. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is typical for test setup scripts and does not contain any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be lowered to 0, as the code performs only standard configuration tasks.",
