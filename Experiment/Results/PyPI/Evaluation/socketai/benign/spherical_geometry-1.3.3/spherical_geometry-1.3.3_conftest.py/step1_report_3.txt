{
  "purpose": "Set up and customize test header modules and version information for testing environment.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest_astropy_header.display' and 'spherical_geometry', and modifications to the PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES and TESTED_VERSIONS dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code only modifies dictionaries and sets version info.",
  "flows": "Imported modules assign to local variables; dictionary modifications update test header configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code simply manages module imports and dictionary entries.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import modules and set up testing metadata. It handles ImportError gracefully by assigning empty dictionaries or 'unknown' version, which is standard practice. The dictionary modifications are straightforward, removing certain entries and setting version info for 'spherical-geometry'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for test environment configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
