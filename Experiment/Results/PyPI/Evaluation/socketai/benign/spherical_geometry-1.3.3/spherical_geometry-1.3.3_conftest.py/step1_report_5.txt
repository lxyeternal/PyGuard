{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import and configure test header information for a testing environment, specifically related to the 'pytest_astropy_header' and 'spherical_geometry' packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, version information, and manipulates a dictionary of test header modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; no potential data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to variables; dictionary modifications occur without data flow to external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out instructions for manual customization, but nothing unusual or suspicious in the active code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import specific modules, handles ImportError gracefully, and manages a configuration dictionary for testing purposes. It modifies dictionary entries safely, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data exfiltration activities present. The overall structure suggests routine test configuration code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test configuration setup for managing package version display during testing. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and primarily intended for testing environment setup.",
