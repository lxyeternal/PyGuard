  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "The only content is licensing information and a brief comment; no unusual code or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment and a descriptive comment about package tests. There are no executable statements, no data handling, and no external interactions. It appears to be a non-functional comment block, which is common in source files. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code are present. The code's simplicity and lack of executable or data flow elements suggest it is benign.",
