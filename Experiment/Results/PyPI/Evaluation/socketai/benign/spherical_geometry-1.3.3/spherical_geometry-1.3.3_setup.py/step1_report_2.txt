  "purpose": "Setup script for building the spherical_geometry Python package with optional external dependencies and platform-specific configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USE_SYSTEM_QD, QD_PATH), filesystem (libqd directory, .c files), subprocess (qd-config command), and package files.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'qd-config' which execute external commands, environment variable reads, and file path manipulations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem paths influence subprocess commands and build configuration, which then influence compilation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the script primarily orchestrates build configurations based on environment and system specifics.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build setup script, managing dependencies and platform-specific compilation options. It uses environment variables to determine whether to use system-installed libraries or custom builds. It calls external tools like 'qd-config' and checks for their presence, which is standard for build scripts. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or backdoors are present. The subprocess call to 'qd-config' is controlled and based on system environment, not user input. The code does not perform any suspicious actions beyond typical package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard build setup for a Python extension module. It manages dependencies and platform differences without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malware, data leaks, or security risks are evident from the code.",
