  "purpose": "The script configures the build environment for a Python extension module, managing dependencies, platform-specific settings, and external configuration tools.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USE_SYSTEM_QD, QD_PATH), filesystem (glob for source files), subprocess call to 'qd-config', and filesystem checks.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess invocation of 'qd-config' which outputs configuration flags; environment variables influencing build parameters.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (USE_SYSTEM_QD, QD_PATH) influence subprocess calls and source inclusion; 'qd-config' outputs are used for compiler and linker flags.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; subprocess calls are standard and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for building a Python extension with C/C++ sources. It uses environment variables to determine whether to use system-installed dependencies or bundled sources. It checks for the presence of 'qd-config' and invokes it via subprocess to obtain build flags. Error handling is appropriate, and external commands are validated with 'shutil.which'. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The code's logic is straightforward, with platform-specific configurations handled cleanly. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build configuration script for a Python extension module. It relies on environment variables and external tools in a controlled manner. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
