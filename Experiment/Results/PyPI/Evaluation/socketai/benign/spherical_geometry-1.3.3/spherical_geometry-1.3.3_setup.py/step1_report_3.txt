  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Python extension module with optional system or bundled dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USE_SYSTEM_QD, QD_PATH), file system (libqd directory, .c/.cpp source files), subprocess (qd-config), Python modules (numpy), system platform info.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to 'qd-config' (potential command injection if environment manipulated), printing error messages (console output), exit calls, reading environment variables, file system operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (USE_SYSTEM_QD, QD_PATH) influence source and include paths, subprocess call retrieves build flags from 'qd-config' or environment, source files are assembled based on the system configuration, and setup() uses the assembled extension info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for paths, subprocess call to external tool 'qd-config' which could be manipulated, conditional logic for different OS, minimal validation of environment variables. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for building a Python extension module, with conditional logic for system-specific dependencies and external configuration via environment variables and subprocess. The subprocess call to 'qd-config' could be a point of concern if environment variables are maliciously altered, but it is a standard external configuration call. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or hidden network activity are present. The code uses safe practices for importing modules, checking dependencies, and constructing build configurations. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate build infrastructure without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python extension, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It uses environment variables and subprocess calls for configuration, which is typical in such scripts. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
