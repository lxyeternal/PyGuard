  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build configuration script for a Python extension module. It relies on environment variables and external tools in a controlled manner. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
