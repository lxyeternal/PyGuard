  "purpose": "Attempt to import the package version from a local module, or set it to an empty string if import fails.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module '_version' and attempts to access its 'version' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only assigns a variable based on import success.",
  "flows": "Import from ._version -> assign to __version__ or fallback to ''",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code uses standard import fallback pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import '__version__' from a local module '_version'. If the import fails, it sets __version__ to an empty string. This is a common pattern for handling optional version information. No external data sources, no malicious behavior, and no suspicious constructs are present. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical version import fallback with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply manages version information with safe, standard practice.",
