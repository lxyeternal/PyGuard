  "purpose": "Attempt to import the package version information from a relative module _version; if unavailable, assign an empty string.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._version import version as __version__",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data sinks involved in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Import statement to variable assignment (__version__ = '') if ImportError occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to handle import failure; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import version info from a relative module. If the module does not exist or fails to import, it assigns an empty string to __version__. This is a common pattern for optional version info handling in Python packages. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious logic is evident. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard version import with fallback and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical package boilerplate code.",
