  "purpose": "This code attempts to import the package's version information from a local module; if not available, it sets the version to an empty string.",

  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__",
  "flows": "Import from local module → assignment to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard pattern for version handling",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a version string from a local module '_version'. If the import fails (e.g., the module does not exist), it sets __version__ to an empty string. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, and no untrusted data handling. The code is straightforward and common in Python packaging. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for managing package versioning with no malicious intent or security issues.",
