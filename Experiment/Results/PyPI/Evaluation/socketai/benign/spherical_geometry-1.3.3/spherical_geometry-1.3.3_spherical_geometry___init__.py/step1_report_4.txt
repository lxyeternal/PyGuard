  "purpose": "Attempt to import the version information of the package from a local module, with fallback to an empty string if not available.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and potentially the local file '_version.py'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Import statement attempts to load '__version__' from the local module; if fails, sets '__version__' to an empty string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard version import pattern with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a version string from a local module. If the import fails, it assigns an empty string. This is a common pattern for version management in Python packages. No suspicious or malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated elements. The code is minimal and appears to serve a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version import pattern with a safe fallback. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
