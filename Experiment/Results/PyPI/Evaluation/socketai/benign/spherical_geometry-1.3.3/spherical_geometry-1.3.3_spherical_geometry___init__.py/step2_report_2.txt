  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a try-except block attempting to import a version string from a local module `_version`, with a fallback to an empty string if the import fails.\n- The code pattern is standard in Python packaging to handle optional version modules.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected across all reports.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- The confidence level is high (1) for all reports, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and commonality of the pattern.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code as provided matches the descriptions.\n- No evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The pattern is a typical, safe fallback mechanism for version management.\n\n**Potential issues or considerations:**\n- Since the code is straightforward, there are no logical flaws or security risks.\n- The only minor point is that the fallback to an empty string could, in some contexts, hide version info, but this is a benign and common pattern, not malicious.\n\n**Scores and conclusions:**\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The confidence scores of 1 are justified given the clarity and commonality of the pattern.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard version import fallback pattern with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis above.",
