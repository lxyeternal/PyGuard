  "flows": "Import statement -> assignment to __version__",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block to handle import errors is common; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation observed. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a version string from a local module '_version'. If the import fails, it sets __version__ to an empty string. This is a standard pattern for handling optional version modules. No malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or obfuscation detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, focused on version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical version handling snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles import failure gracefully. Overall, safe and non-malicious.",
