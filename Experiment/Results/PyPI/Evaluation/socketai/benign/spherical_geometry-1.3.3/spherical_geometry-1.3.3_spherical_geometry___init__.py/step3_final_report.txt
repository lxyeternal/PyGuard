  "purpose": "Attempt to import version information from a local '_version' module, with a fallback to an empty string if the import fails.",

  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__, which could be used elsewhere in the package or application.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from '_version' module -> success or failure -> fallback assignment to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a common pattern for optional version info import. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python pattern used in packaging to handle optional version modules. It attempts to import 'version' from a local '_version' module; if the module is missing, it assigns an empty string. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The code does not perform network operations, data leaks, or execute malicious payloads. The try-except block is a common, safe practice. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and widespread use of this pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for optional version information import. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
