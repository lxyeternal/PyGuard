  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward pattern for importing version info with a fallback. The code snippet is minimal, standard, and does not contain any obfuscation or malicious constructs. There are no errors or anomalies in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the try-except pattern as a common practice for optional version imports. No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \nSince the code is a standard version import pattern with no malicious activity, the risk score should remain at 0. The current assignment is justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \nNo evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code simply attempts to import a version string and handles failure gracefully.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's actual behavior, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Additional comments:\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the current scores. The code is boilerplate, safe, and non-malicious. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign pattern for handling optional version information. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
