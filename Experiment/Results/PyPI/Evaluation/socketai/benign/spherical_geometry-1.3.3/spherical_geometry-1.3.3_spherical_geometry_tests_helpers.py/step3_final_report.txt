  "purpose": "Generate a set of celestial coordinate points and resolve image filenames, possibly handling compressed files.",
  "sources": "File existence checks in resolve_imagename; coordinate data in get_point_set",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present",
  "flows": "resolve_imagename checks for file existence, then constructs filename; get_point_set generates coordinate points and converts to vectors",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code generates celestial coordinate points, converting RA/Dec to vectors, and resolves image filenames by checking existence and replacing extensions if needed. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The filename resolution could be slightly risky if inputs are untrusted, but no such context is provided. The code is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. The reports are empty, providing no additional concerns. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware score is zero.",
