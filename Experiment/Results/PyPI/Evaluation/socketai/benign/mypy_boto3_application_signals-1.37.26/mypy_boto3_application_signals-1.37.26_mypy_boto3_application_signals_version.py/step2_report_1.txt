  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code in question is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n- All reports agree that there are no inputs, external data, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is standard for version declaration, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code simply assigns `\"1.37.26\"` to `__version__`.\n- **No issues are present.** The code is correct, minimal, and typical for version declaration.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws in the Reports:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- No flawed reasoning is evident; all assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, and the code is a standard version declaration, this is appropriate.\n- No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n**5. Malware Score Considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly avoid speculative claims; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n- No inconsistencies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n| Metric             | Reasoning                                                    | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | No malicious activity, static assignment, benign code      | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | Clear, straightforward code, no obfuscation                  | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | No inputs, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors     | 0               |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.**  \n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, safe version declaration with no security concerns.",
