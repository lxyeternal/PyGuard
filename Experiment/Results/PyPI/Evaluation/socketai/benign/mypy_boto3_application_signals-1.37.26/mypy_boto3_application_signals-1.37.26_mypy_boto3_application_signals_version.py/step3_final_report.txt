  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward version string assignment with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, with accompanying copyright comments. It contains no dynamic code, inputs, external data, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard version declaration. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
