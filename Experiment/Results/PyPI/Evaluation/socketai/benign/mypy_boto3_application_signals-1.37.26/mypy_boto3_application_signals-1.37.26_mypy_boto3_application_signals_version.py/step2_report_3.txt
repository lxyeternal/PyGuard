  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - The code is minimal, with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No justification needed for higher scores, as the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code is purely a static assignment with no malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe is well-supported.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard version declaration, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n\nThis is a typical, benign version declaration file. No further action or concern is warranted.",
