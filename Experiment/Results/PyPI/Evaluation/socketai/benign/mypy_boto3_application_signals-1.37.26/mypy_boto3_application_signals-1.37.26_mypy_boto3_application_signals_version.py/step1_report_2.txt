  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is simple, standard version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, which is a common practice for package versioning. The copyright notice indicates intent for source of truth but does not introduce any malicious or suspicious behavior. No external input, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
