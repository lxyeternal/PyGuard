  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.26\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, external data, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code appears standard for a version declaration in a Python package.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5 Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, static assignment of a version string.\n- They note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n- All assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- All assign a security risk score of 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Any discrepancies?**  \nNo. All reports are consistent in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  Yes. The `malware` score of 0 aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.  \n  The `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified given the code's benign nature.  \n  The `obfuscated` score of 0 is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n\n- **Are any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n\n- **Is there any overlooked risk?**  \n  No. The code is minimal and standard; no hidden behaviors or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard version declaration.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
