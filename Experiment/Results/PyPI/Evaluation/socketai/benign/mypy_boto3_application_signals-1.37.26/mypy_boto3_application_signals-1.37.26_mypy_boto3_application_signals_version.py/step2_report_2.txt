  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a straightforward assignment:\n```python\n__version__ = \"1.37.26\"\n```\naccompanied by a copyright comment. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static version string to `__version__`. There are no hidden or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that this is a standard version declaration with no suspicious activity.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of any security concerns.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Given the code's simplicity, all scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n- **Any signs of obfuscation or malicious intent?**  \n  No.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a standard version declaration, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n### My personal estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is benign, with a straightforward assignment of a version string. The scores reflect this, and no further action is needed.",
