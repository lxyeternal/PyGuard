{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-application-signals' Python module, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static metadata and configuration data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data is processed at runtime; no data is sent over networks or written to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks; the script only reads local files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static reading of a markdown file and defines package setup parameters using setuptools. There are no dynamic or user-input-driven operations, nor any network or file system manipulations involving untrusted data. No unusual language features or obfuscated code are present. All dependencies and metadata are static and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
