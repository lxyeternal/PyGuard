  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-application-signals package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; reading environment variables via package requirements (indirectly through dependencies).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is being written or sent externally.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flows; setup process reads local files and static configuration data without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or other suspicious activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a local README file for documentation, and calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters to configure package installation. There are no code injection, network operations, or credential handling. All data is static and controlled. No anomalies or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious operations.",
