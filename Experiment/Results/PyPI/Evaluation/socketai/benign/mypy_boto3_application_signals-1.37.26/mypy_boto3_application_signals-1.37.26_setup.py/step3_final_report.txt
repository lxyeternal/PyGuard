{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging of the 'mypy-boto3-application-signals' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the local README.md file for long description; static package metadata; conditional dependency based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any data leaks or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year '2025' is future-dated, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a local file, defines package metadata, and includes conditional dependencies based on Python version. No untrusted input, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The future-dated copyright is not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a standard setup script. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
