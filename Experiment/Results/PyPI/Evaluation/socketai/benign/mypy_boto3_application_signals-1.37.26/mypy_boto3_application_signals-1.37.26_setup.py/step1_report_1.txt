  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-application-signals package, used for package configuration and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or code execution points identified.",
  "flows": "Reads file content and passes static configuration data to setup() function; no dynamic or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors present. The copyright year '2025' may be future-dated but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a static README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It reads a README file and provides static configuration data for package distribution, showing no evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
