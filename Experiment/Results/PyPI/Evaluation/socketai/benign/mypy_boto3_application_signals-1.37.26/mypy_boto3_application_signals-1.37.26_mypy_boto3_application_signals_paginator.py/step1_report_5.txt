{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the application-signals service client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module. Reading class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling; methods are just wrappers around paginator classes with type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sinks; paginate methods pass through parameters to superclass methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is primarily boilerplate with standard class inheritance and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type definitions, conditional imports, and paginator class definitions with 'paginate' methods. All code adheres to standard practices for boto3 paginator wrappers, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The imports and class structures are straightforward, with documentation links included. No untrusted input handling or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate set of paginator class wrappers for boto3's application-signals client, focusing on type annotations and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
