{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the application-signals service client, enabling type-safe pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs. Data read occurs in method parameters during paginate calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs, no network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to paginate methods (via **kwargs), with flow confined within class methods returning page iterators.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns. Usage of conditional imports and type annotations is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for various API endpoints, inheriting from generic Paginator with type annotations for response data. Conditional imports based on Python version are standard. No external network calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. The code is well-structured, mainly providing type hints and class definitions for pagination with documentation links. There are no anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured type annotation and pagination class implementation for boto3 service client. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
