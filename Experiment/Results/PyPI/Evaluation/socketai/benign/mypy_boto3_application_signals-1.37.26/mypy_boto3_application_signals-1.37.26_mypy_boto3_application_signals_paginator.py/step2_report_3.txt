  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines type annotations and paginator classes for the application-signals service client.\n- Content: No untrusted data sources, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- Conclusion: Standard SDK stub code, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (low, primarily documentation and type annotations)\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is boilerplate for type hints, with no suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. The security risk is minimal, given the static nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define paginator classes with type annotations for boto3.\n- Content: No external data processing or network activity, just class definitions and method signatures.\n- Conclusion: Standard, generated boto3 stub classes.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is typical for SDK stubs, with no malicious indicators. Malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Provide type annotations and paginator classes for 'application-signals'.\n- Content: No external data sinks, network, or file operations; purely class and method definitions.\n- Conclusion: Well-structured, legitimate code with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (low, mainly documentation and type annotations)\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. No suspicious activity detected, malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and paginator classes for API responses.\n- Content: No external data handling, just method wrappers and type hints.\n- Conclusion: Benign, well-structured code with no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is clear. No malicious behavior, malware score at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Define paginators with type annotations.\n- Content: No untrusted data handling, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Standard, legitimate code for boto3 paginator wrappers.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports describe static, boilerplate SDK stub code focused on type annotations and class definitions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the static, documentation-oriented nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is safe and standard for SDK type hinting.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to the presence of type annotations and boilerplate code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-structured SDK stub code with no security concerns.",
