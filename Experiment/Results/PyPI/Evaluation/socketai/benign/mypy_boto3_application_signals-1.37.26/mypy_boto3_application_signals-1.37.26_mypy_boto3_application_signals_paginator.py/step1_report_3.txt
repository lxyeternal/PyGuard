{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the 'application-signals' service client in boto3, enabling type-safe pagination over specific API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules, and accesses boto3 client methods such as get_paginator. It also uses conditional imports based on Python version for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that execute untrusted input or send data externally; it primarily defines classes and methods for pagination.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the paginate methods where kwargs are unpacked from potentially external sources, but these are standard method parameters. There are no indications of data being sent over network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The code structure and comments indicate standard use of boto3 and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several paginator classes for a specific AWS service, utilizing type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility. The paginate methods are simple wrappers around boto3's paginator, accepting kwargs of specific types. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be well-structured, intended for type-safe API pagination, with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, legitimate, and focused on type annotations and pagination class definitions for boto3. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe for use, serving solely as a type-safe interface.",
