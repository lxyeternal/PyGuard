  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the application-signals service client to facilitate paginated API calls with proper type checking.",
  "sources": "Code imports (sys, typing, botocore.paginate, custom type definitions), class method parameters (kwargs), and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sources, network connections, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Method calls to 'paginate' with **kwargs pass data through type-annotated parameters; no external data flow or untrusted input handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code is mostly boilerplate for type annotations and class definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides typed paginator classes for a boto3 client, leveraging type hints, conditional imports for compatibility, and structured class inheritance. All code appears standard for SDK stub generation, with no signs of malicious activity. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious logic detected. The focus is on static type checking and documentation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK stub code used for type hinting and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for API pagination with proper type annotations.",
