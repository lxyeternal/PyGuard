{
  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for the application-signals service client in boto3 with type annotations, enabling typed iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and boto3 modules; type definitions from local type_defs module; the code itself, especially class definitions and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments (**kwargs) with specific types, but do not process untrusted data directly; no data sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (**kwargs) flow into the 'paginate' methods, which then call the underlying Paginator's 'paginate' with these parameters, returning PageIterator objects containing response data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code adheres to standard boto3 stubs implementation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from generic Paginator types, adding 'paginate' methods with detailed docstrings and type annotations. Conditional import of 'Unpack' based on Python version and the use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints follow best practices. No external or untrusted data processing or network activity is present. The code appears to be standard, generated boto3 stub classes with proper typing and documentation references. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of boto3 paginator stub classes for type hinting and IDE support, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard patterns and is safe to use.",
