  "purpose": "Type annotations for application-signals service client paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports of type definitions, class inheritance, method parameters, and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; methods accept kwargs and pass them to boto3 paginator.",
  "flows": "Kwargs flow from paginate method parameters into boto3 paginator calls, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard SDK stub classes for boto3 paginators with type annotations, conditional imports, and documentation links. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation present. The structure is typical for static type support and documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK stub code intended for static type checking and IDE support. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements.",
