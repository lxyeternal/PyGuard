  "purpose": "Defines the main interface for an application-signals service by importing and re-exporting specific client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), including class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly imports and re-exports classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only standard import/export code, no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports for a Python SDK, including documentation, copyright info, and import statements. No external data inputs, command execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a typical package interface module, with no malicious behaviors or security concerns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module for defining and exporting SDK components. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
