  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and functions from internal modules (.client and .paginator), sets up a class alias, and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n- The documentation string provides usage examples but contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing.\n- No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical SDK interface or package setup component.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Main interface for application-signals service.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data sinks, anomalies, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, structural component.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Defines main interface via imports and re-exports.\n- **Findings:** No external data handling, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Interface for application signals, includes documentation.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.05.\n- **Note:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.05) due to the documentation mention, but no actual security concern.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score seems slightly overestimated; documentation alone doesn't introduce security risk. I would suggest lowering this to 0.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Main interface, import/export setup.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no external input, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Interface and documentation setup.\n- **Findings:** No data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, except Report 3 has 0.05, which seems unjustified based solely on documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** For Report 3, I recommend lowering from 0.05 to 0, as documentation alone doesn't pose a security risk.\n\n### Overall estimate:\n\nConsidering all reports, the code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor risk score in Report 3 should be adjusted downward.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (for all reports, including Report 3)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
