  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and functions, sets up an alias, and defines `__all__`. No untrusted data, no anomalies, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that this is a benign, structural component is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a module that imports and re-exports classes/functions with no external data handling or anomalies.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, consistent with the benign description.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard SDK interface module with no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Slightly more cautious, notes the documentation and import setup, but finds no suspicious patterns or external data handling.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.05, **Malware:** 0.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's nature—imports, class alias, documentation—this minimal risk score seems reasonable. No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard imports, class alias, documentation, no dynamic code or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0, Malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—imports, documentation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0, Malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Malware score:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0 to 0.05), reflecting the benign, structural nature of the module.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's actual content.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is a standard, safe interface module with no security concerns.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (to account for minimal, non-malicious complexity or documentation, but still negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, and the security risk is minimal.",
