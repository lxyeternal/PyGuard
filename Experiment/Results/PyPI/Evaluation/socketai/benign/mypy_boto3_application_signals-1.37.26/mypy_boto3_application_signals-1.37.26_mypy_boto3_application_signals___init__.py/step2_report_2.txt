  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a straightforward interface module that re-exports classes and functions from internal modules.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty)  \n**Assessment:** Fully benign, standard SDK interface code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on re-exporting SDK components.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies, no external data flows, no suspicious constructs.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1  \n**Assessment:** Also benign, typical SDK module.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—importing local modules, setting up documentation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external data handling, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.05 (slightly above zero) — justified as minimal, probably due to documentation string.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95  \n**Assessment:** Still benign; the minor security risk score likely accounts for documentation, not code behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar import and export setup, standard for SDK modules.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** all zero for malware and obfuscation, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1  \n**Assessment:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—importing classes, setting up __all__, documentation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data flows, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1  \n**Assessment:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** The code is a simple module that imports classes and functions from internal modules and re-exports them, serving as an SDK interface.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Security Risks:** No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, no secrets or credentials embedded. The minor security risk score in one report seems justified by documentation, not code behavior.  \n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** All reports are consistent; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.  \n- **Scores:** All are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — the code is a benign SDK interface with no security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign module serving as an interface layer for an SDK. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The provided scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
