{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for an application-signals service by importing and re-exporting specific clients and paginators from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from .client and .paginator modules, and string assignments for __all__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up class and function references",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and defines a Client alias and an __all__ list for export. It contains a docstring with documentation and usage examples, but no runtime input or external data handling. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard package setup for a client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural component of a client library without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as an interface layer for other modules or external callers.",
