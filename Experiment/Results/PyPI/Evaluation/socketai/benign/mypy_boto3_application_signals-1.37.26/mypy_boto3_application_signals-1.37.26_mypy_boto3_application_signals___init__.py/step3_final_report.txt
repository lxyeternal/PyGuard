  "purpose": "Main interface for application-signals service.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class aliasing without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK module that imports classes and functions, sets up a class alias, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. Documentation is standard and provides usage examples. The code's structure and content are typical for a package interface, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
