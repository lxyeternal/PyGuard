{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface and documentation for the application-signals service client and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from local files (.client and .paginator). No input data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling functions present that could leak untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up class references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only standard module imports, class aliasing, and documentation. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from local modules, sets an alias, and defines the __all__ exports. The documentation provides usage instructions with examples. No user input handling, no network operations, no environment variable manipulations, and no execution of dynamic code or obfuscated logic. All code appears standard for a client library setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an API interface module, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical structured library setup with documentation and class imports.",
