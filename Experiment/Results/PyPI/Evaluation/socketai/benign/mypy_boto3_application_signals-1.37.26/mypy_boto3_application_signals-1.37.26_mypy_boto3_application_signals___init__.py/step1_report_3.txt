{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for a service client related to application signals, including imports, class aliasing, and documentation for usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the documentation string providing usage examples.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly takes untrusted input or writes data to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines aliases; it does not process untrusted data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The documentation string appears standard and informative.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes from local modules, sets up a class alias, and defines __all__ for exports. The documentation string provides usage instructions with no embedded code execution or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. All imports seem standard for a Python package intended as a client interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup for a client interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.",
