{
  "purpose": "This code provides the main interface for an application-signals service, defining imports, class aliasing, and module exports for a Python package related to AWS boto3 SDK wrappers.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), reading package metadata, and defining exports.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution; the code mainly defines imports and aliases.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into local namespace variables and export definitions, with no external data input flows present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The comments and structure are typical for a Python SDK interface module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward imports from local modules, defines a class alias, and specifies the __all__ list for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or sensitive data processing. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be part of a well-structured SDK package interface with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python SDK interface module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily organizes imports and exports, serving as a clean, non-malicious interface layer.",
