  "purpose": "Define type literals for application-signals service in Python, primarily for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is solely type definition with no data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and consistent with type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types for use as type annotations. It includes comprehensive lists of service names, resource names, paginator names, and other string-based literals used in AWS SDK contexts. There are no runtime operations, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The content is purely static type definitions intended for type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static type definition module for AWS service string literals, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended solely for enhancing type annotations and code clarity, with no malicious intent.",
