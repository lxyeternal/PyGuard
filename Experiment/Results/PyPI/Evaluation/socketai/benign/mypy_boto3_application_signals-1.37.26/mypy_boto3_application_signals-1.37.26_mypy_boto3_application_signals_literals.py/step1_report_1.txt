  "purpose": "Define type annotations for application signals and service names in the boto3 application-signals library.",
  "sources": "Literal type definitions assigned to variables such as DurationUnitType, ServiceName, etc.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants and type aliases, with no data input/output handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is solely type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports necessary modules and defines numerous Literal types for use in boto3 SDK type annotations. It includes conditional import for Literal based on Python version, and then assigns various string literals to variables for type safety. No user input handling, network operations, or data manipulation present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution mechanisms are observed. The content appears to be standard type hinting definitions for an SDK, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of static type annotations for the SDK. No malware or security threats are present. It appears to be a legitimate part of the SDK's type definitions.",
