  "purpose": "Define string literal types for application-signals service and related entities to facilitate type checking and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions and import statements, particularly where 'sys' module is used to determine the type annotation import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None detected; code primarily consists of type alias definitions and conditional imports.",
  "flows": "The only flow of data is the import logic that dynamically selects 'Literal' based on Python version, which is benign.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is purely type annotations with no runtime behavior or external data access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', which is standard practice. It then defines numerous string literal types used for type annotations. These definitions are straightforward, static, and serve as type hints. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data access is present. The overall structure and content appear normal for a type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition file for literal types used in a larger codebase, with no malicious behavior detected. It is well-structured, static, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code elements.",
