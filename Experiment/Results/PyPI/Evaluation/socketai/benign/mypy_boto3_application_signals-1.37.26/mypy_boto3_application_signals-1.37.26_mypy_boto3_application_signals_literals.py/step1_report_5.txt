  "purpose": "Define string literal types for application signals and AWS service identifiers used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to variables, imported modules for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code only defines literals and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present. The license and copyright notice are standard. No obfuscation or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of conditional import statements for 'Literal' depending on Python version, and extensive definitions of string literal types for various AWS services and application signals. All data are static string literals assigned to type alias variables. No external inputs are processed, no network operations, no code execution, and no sensitive data handling are present. The structure is straightforward and standard for type hinting modules. No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static type definitions file intended for type annotations in Python projects. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks.",
