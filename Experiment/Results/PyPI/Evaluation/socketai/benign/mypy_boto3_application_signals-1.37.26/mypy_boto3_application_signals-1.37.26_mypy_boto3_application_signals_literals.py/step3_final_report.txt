  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS SDK literals, including service names, resource types, and paginator identifiers.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals and conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions for string literals representing AWS services, resource names, and paginator identifiers. The conditional import of 'Literal' is standard for compatibility. No dynamic code, data processing, or external data handling is present. The code serves as type safety and documentation aid, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for type annotations. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores are consistent with its nature.",
