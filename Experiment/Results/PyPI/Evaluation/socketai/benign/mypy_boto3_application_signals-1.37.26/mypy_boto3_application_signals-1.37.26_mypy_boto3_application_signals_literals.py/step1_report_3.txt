  "purpose": "Define string literal types for application-signals service configurations and other AWS service identifiers.",
  "sources": "Importing sys for version check, defining string literals for various AWS service names and types.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing detected; all string literals are predefined constants.",
  "flows": "N/A — no dynamic data flow; static literals are used for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior identified. The code is primarily type annotations and constants definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', then defines various Literal type aliases for AWS service-related strings. All literals are static, predefined strings. There is no dynamic execution, external input processing, or suspicious code logic. No malicious behavior or sabotage appears to be present. The code appears to be standard type annotation setup for AWS SDK stubs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It solely defines constants for type safety and documentation purposes.",
