  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The code only contains static type alias definitions and imports. No runtime or dynamic code.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None. The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Justification for scores?**  \n  No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected; the scores are reasonable.\n- **Overall assessment:**  \n  Fully consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. Pure type annotations and constants.\n- **Errors, flaws?**  \n  None. The description correctly notes the absence of suspicious activity.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification?**  \n  The code is static, with no runtime logic or external interactions.\n- **Overall assessment:**  \n  Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. Static string literals and conditional import.\n- **Errors, flaws?**  \n  None. The report accurately describes the code.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate for static type definitions.\n- **Justification?**  \n  No malicious intent or obfuscation, so scores are justified.\n- **Overall assessment:**  \n  Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The code is only type annotations and import logic.\n- **Errors, flaws?**  \n  None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, matching the benign description.\n- **Justification?**  \n  No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Overall assessment:**  \n  Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. Static literals and safe import logic.\n- **Errors, flaws?**  \n  None. The analysis correctly states the benign nature.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- **Justification?**  \n  No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Overall assessment:**  \n  Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which is justified given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, as there's no security threat or vulnerability.\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is purely static type definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, standard, and safe for use in type annotation contexts.",
