  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or overlooked issues.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe static type annotation definitions consisting of string literal types for AWS services, resource names, paginator names, etc.\n- The code uses conditional imports for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, network operations, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The purpose is purely to improve type safety and documentation in the SDK.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Define type annotations for application signals and service names.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as static type definitions with no runtime behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware or security risk.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- `malware`: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- `securityRisk`: 0 — no security issues.  \n- `risk`: 0.5 seems appropriate; the code is purely static.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for application-signals service.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no runtime logic, no external data, just type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type annotations.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- All scores at 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS services.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the static nature and absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- All zero scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types with version-dependent import.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic or malicious code; the version check is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard type definitions.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Zero scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Define literals for signals and AWS identifiers.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; straightforward static definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- All scores at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** No evidence of code execution, data handling, or dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware potential:** None. The code is purely static type annotations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward static code.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, well-structured set of static type annotations for AWS SDK literals. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nApprove all reports as safe, with a malware, obfuscated, and risk score of 0.",
