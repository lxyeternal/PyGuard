  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument; if present, calls print_version() which outputs version; otherwise, calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no external data fetching, no suspicious network activity, no code injection or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that prints package info or version. It only reads command-line arguments and writes static text to stdout. No external data sources, no network connections, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears clean, simple, and purpose-driven with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for displaying package information and version details via CLI. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
