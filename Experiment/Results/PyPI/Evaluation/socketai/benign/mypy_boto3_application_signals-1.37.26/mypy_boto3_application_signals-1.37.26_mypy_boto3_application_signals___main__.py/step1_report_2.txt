  "purpose": "The script is a CLI entry point for a package that provides information about the boto3 CloudWatchApplicationSignals library, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs information to stdout)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version, otherwise print_info outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines functions to print static package info and version. The main() function checks for a '--version' argument to decide which info to display. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external network connections, no data leaks, or malicious code. The script simply outputs predefined package metadata. It appears to be a standard CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security issues identified.",
