  "purpose": "CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for output",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> main() -> print_info()/print_version() -> sys.stdout.write()",
  "anomalies": "None; static, straightforward code with no dynamic or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that checks for '--version' in sys.argv and prints either version info or package details. It contains no external data fetching, environment variable access, network activity, or obfuscation. The functions are minimal and static, with no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads. All signals indicate benign, static behavior. The code's clarity and lack of external dependencies support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are consistent with this analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
