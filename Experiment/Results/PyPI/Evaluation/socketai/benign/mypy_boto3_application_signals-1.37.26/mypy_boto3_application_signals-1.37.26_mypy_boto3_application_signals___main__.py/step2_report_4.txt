  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n- It reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n- No external data fetching, environment variable access, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no secrets or credentials.\n- All outputs are hardcoded static strings.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code is benign.\n- No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The logic is straightforward and well within safe practices.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points on Scores and Reasoning:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is correct.\n- No evidence of malicious code, behavior, or payloads.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is accurate.\n- The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign securityRisk=0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- No risky operations or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Confidence:**\n- All reports have high confidence (1), which is justified given the simplicity and static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Improvements:\n- No issues detected; all assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's benign and static nature.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\nConsidering all reports and the code review, I concur with the existing scores. The code is a straightforward CLI utility with no malicious or risky behaviors.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the assessments are accurate and justified.",
