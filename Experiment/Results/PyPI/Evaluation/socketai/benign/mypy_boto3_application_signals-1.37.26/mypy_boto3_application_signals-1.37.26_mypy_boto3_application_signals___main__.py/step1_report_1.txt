{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 CloudWatch application signals, including version info and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Input source is command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "The code reads sys.argv to determine if '--version' is present; if so, it outputs version info. Otherwise, it outputs package info. Data flows from command-line input to stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward, mainly printing static information.",
  "analysis": "The script checks command-line arguments for '--version' and responds accordingly. All data outputs are static, hardcoded strings with no external data fetching, environment variable access, or network activity. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are evident. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors are present. The code performs basic CLI functions without any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign component of a package's CLI interface.",
