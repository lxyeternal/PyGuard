{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that displays package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (user input via command line), sys.stdout (output to console)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (print info and version data)",
  "flows": "User input (--version) triggers output of version info; otherwise, info is printed to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and mainly outputs static data.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for input/output operations, defines functions to print package info and version, and handles command-line arguments. No user-supplied data is processed beyond argument checking. The printed data are static strings with no dynamic code execution or external data fetching. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script that outputs package information and version details with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears benign and intended for informational purposes only.",
