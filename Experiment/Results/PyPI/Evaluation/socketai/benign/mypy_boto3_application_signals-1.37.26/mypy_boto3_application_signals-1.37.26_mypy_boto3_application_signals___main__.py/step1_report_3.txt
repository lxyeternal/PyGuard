  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stub documentation.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for printing information",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for output, which is standard and safe; no other sinks are present",
  "flows": "Command-line input influences control flow (checking '--version'), which then leads to printing static info or version",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present. All data printed is static and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that checks for a command-line argument '--version' and accordingly prints static package info or version details. The code uses standard library functions without any external or malicious behavior. No input is processed besides the command-line argument; output is static. There are no suspicious data flows or external network calls. The code structure is simple and typical for CLI entrypoints, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package info and version, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
