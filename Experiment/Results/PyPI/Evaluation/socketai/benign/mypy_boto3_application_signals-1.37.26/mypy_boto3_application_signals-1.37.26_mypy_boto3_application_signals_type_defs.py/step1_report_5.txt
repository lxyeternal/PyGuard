  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for application-signals service interactions and data models.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external data sources (implied in data definitions).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data usage occurs in data assignments, or if these types are used insecurely elsewhere, but no direct sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow is primarily from external input to data structure assignments and type definitions; no actual data processing logic or untrusted data flows are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of version checks for imports is standard and benign. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions using Python's TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports based on sys.version_info. No executable code, external system calls, network operations, or data manipulation logic are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for API data models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is purely for type annotations and data model definitions without any executable or malicious code. There are no security threats or malware indicators in the provided code.",
