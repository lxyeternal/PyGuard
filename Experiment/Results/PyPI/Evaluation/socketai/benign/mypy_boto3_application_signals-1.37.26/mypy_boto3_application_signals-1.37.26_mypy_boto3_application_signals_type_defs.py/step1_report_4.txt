{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for application-signals service, including data structures and API input/output formats.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions, and local literals module; type definitions and annotations throughout the file.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data types (e.g., dictionaries, sequences) into API schemas; no untrusted data is processed insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type definitions, with no executable logic, data processing, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, code injections, or obfuscated constructs observed. No dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or similar functions used.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines numerous TypedDicts, Union types, and constants to specify data structures for a service's API. It adapts imports based on Python version, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior is present. No data handling, file I/O, network calls, or system commands are implemented. The content appears purely declarative, serving as type annotations and data schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for a Python API client or server, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
