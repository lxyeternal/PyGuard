{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for application-signals service interactions, primarily used for type checking and documentation in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as sys, datetime, typing, and internal literals; reads no external inputs; defines data structures based on type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No code executes or processes untrusted input; no functions, network calls, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code establishes type definitions and structures without executable logic, so there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; usage of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type definitions, imports, and constants used for static type checking and documentation. No functions, data processing, or executable logic are present. It adheres to standard practices for compatibility across Python versions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The inclusion of version-dependent imports and type annotations aligns with best practices, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions and documentation references, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and solely intended for static typing support.",
