  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a set of type annotations, data structures, and documentation for an SDK or API client related to application signals.\n- They emphasize that the code is static, only defining data schemas with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code uses standard practices, including conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- The confidence level is high (1), and malware/obfuscated scores are consistently zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Analysis of reasoning:** The reports correctly identify that the code is only type definitions and documentation, with no malicious or insecure behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws in reasoning are evident.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified, given the absence of executable logic, data handling, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities and Assumptions:\n- The reports challenge any claims of vulnerabilities based solely on type annotations, which is correct. Type definitions alone do not introduce security risks.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are unjustified; the code is standard for SDK type definitions.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, consistent with their reasoning.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis and Personal Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or behaviors.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward type definitions with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — Purely declarative, no executable logic, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and data schemas for a Python SDK or API client. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or insecure elements. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.  \n- No further action needed regarding security concerns.\n\n**Overall security assessment:** **Safe and benign.**",
