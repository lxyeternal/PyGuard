  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations for application-signals service; no external input processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses standard compatibility practices; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely static type definitions, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is solely type annotations and documentation, with no runtime or external data handling. The malware score is 0, which is appropriate. The risk score is 0, matching the absence of any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; static type definitions, imports for compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard patterns, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No runtime code, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the report correctly notes the static nature and safety of the code. Malware score remains 0. Risk score is 0, consistent with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for data models and API interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Only static data structures, no dynamic or external code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely declarative code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code content. Malware score is 0, risk score is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, no executable logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Pure type definitions, safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate evaluation; malware score 0, risk score 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions, potential external data sources are only implied.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Static data models only.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code; malware score 0, risk score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely static type annotations and documentation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** Since all reports correctly assess the code as non-executable, non-malicious, and purely declarative, the risk score should be 0 for all.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately score the code as safe. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the code's nature as static type definitions, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0. The confidence in this assessment is high, as all evidence points to a benign, purely structural codebase.",
