  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions and data structures for application signals service interactions, including input/output types for API calls and data models.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all data definitions are static type annotations and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code solely defines types and data structures without data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; as type definitions, they do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only type annotations, class definitions, and static data structures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or runtime behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for a Python SDK or API client, utilizing standard Python features such as TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility. It includes no code that executes logic or handles external input, and no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation. All elements are consistent with data modeling purposes. No anomalies, secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a purely structural codebase defining data types for an application signals service. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK type definitions file.",
