  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for application-signals; no external data sources or execution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses standard compatibility patterns; no suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Entirely static type definitions, no executable code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type annotations and data schemas.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, purely data structures and type annotations.\n- No runtime logic or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: type definitions, no executable logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous analyses: static type definitions, no runtime code or external data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports contain only static type annotations and data structure definitions, with no code execution, network calls, or data handling that could be malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation techniques (such as eval, exec, string encoding, or code hiding) are present.\n- **Security Risk:** The code is purely declarative, serving as type hints and documentation; it does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no active or passive security risk identified.\n\n**In conclusion,** the provided code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK or API client. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
