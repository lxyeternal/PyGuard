{
  "purpose": "Defines static type annotations, data structures, and documentation for the application-signals SDK, serving as schema definitions without executable logic.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and documentation references; no external input or runtime data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; purely static data schemas with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code consists solely of type definitions and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; uses standard practices for compatibility and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions and documentation for an SDK, with no executable logic, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. It employs standard Python practices for version compatibility and type annotations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as data schemas and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions and documentation for a Python SDK. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assessment scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence.",
