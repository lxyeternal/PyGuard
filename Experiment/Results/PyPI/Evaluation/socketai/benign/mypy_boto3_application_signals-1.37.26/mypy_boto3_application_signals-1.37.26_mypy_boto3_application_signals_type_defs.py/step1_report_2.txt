  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for application-signals service types in a Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, collections.abc, typing, and typing_extensions; data definitions; type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no execution or untrusted data handling in the code.",
  "flows": "Data definitions provide schema-like structures; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions, import statements, and docstrings for documentation. It includes version-dependent imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. There are no runtime statements, code execution, or data processing logic. All imported modules are standard or related to type hinting. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of type definitions, interface schemas, and documentation, with no runtime code or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation module for a Python SDK. No malicious intent detected.",
