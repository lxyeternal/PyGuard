  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 application-signals service, facilitating type-safe API calls and pagination.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals for documentation URLs, import statements, class and method definitions, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (particularly **kwargs with Unpack[type_def]) which accept input data; return types for API responses; property 'exceptions' for error handling.",
  "flows": "Method calls with **kwargs unpacking input types, returning typed responses; properties providing exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily consists of standard boto3 stub classes and type annotations, with no external data input or malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type-stub definition for the boto3 application-signals client, including class definitions, property accessors, method signatures, and overloads for paginators. It imports standard modules, uses conditional imports for compatibility, and defines type annotations for method parameters and return types, all aligning with boto3 and botocore conventions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be automatically generated or boilerplate for type hinting, with no dynamic or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, boilerplate type stub for a boto3 client, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It provides structured type annotations for the application-signals client methods and exceptions, supporting type-safe development without introducing security concerns.",
