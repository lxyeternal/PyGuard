{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the application-signals service in boto3, facilitating type-safe API calls and pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; method parameters; class properties.",
  "sinks": "generate_presigned_url, tag_resource, untag_resource, and other methods that handle parameters or return data, potentially untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "User input or external parameters flow into methods like generate_presigned_url, tag_resource, untag_resource, etc., which then produce URLs or modify resources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code appears to be straightforward type definitions and method signatures. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or hidden data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a client class with type annotations for interacting with AWS application-signals service. It uses standard practices, including method signatures with type hints, property definitions, and method overloading for pagination. No dynamic code execution or suspicious logic is present. The methods and properties align with the official boto3 client pattern, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not contain any hidden or obfuscated segments, nor does it perform any covert operations such as unauthorized data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and client class for AWS boto3, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. It primarily serves as a static interface for safe API calls.",
