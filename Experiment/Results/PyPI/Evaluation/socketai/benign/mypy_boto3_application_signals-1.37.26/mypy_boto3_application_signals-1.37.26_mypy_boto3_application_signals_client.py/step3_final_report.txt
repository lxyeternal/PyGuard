  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Application Signals SDK, providing method signatures, pagination, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports, method parameters (kwargs), class properties, and constants.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (kwargs), return values, exception classes, and properties.",
  "flows": "User inputs into API calls via kwargs; responses and exceptions flow back to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; standard SDK patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated or boilerplate SDK client wrapper with strong type annotations, method overloads for pagination, and exception classes. No malicious patterns, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation detected. It follows standard AWS SDK design, with parameters like Params and HttpMethod being typical for presigned URL generation and resource tagging. The code's structure indicates a safe, well-formed client interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard AWS SDK client stub with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high security risk scores are overestimated; the inherent risk is minimal and primarily related to how the SDK is used, not the code itself.",
