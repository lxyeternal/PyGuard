  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including custom build steps and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'package.json' for package info; executing 'make setup_py' if Makefile exists.",
  "sinks": "Executing system 'make' command; reading files like 'package.json' and 'README.md'.",
  "flows": "Reading package data from files, then executing 'make' if Makefile is present.",
  "anomalies": "Potentially executing 'make' during setup, which could be manipulated if the Makefile is malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are visible. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata from 'package.json' and 'README.md' files, which are standard operations. The custom build class executes 'make setup_py' if a Makefile exists, which could be risky if the Makefile is malicious or tampered with, as it runs system commands during setup. Otherwise, no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical setup tasks with an optional make invocation. The only notable risk is executing a system command ('make setup_py') based on the presence of a Makefile, which could be exploited if the Makefile contains malicious instructions. Otherwise, no malicious intent or malware indicators are present.",
