      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a conditional build step that could be exploited if the Makefile is malicious. No malicious code or obfuscation is present within the script itself. The main risk stems from executing external commands without validation, which is appropriately reflected in the risk scores. Overall, the script is benign but warrants caution regarding the external build process."

The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No revisions are necessary; the overall security evaluation should remain at malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, and risk=0.0."
