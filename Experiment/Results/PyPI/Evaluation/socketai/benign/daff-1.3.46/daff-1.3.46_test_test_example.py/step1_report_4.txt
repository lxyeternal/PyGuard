{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'daff' library to compare two datasets representing countries and their capitals, producing a diff of the data.",
  "sources": "Data arrays 'data1' and 'data2' defined within the code; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations such as network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data arrays are created statically; no flow from external sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs. The code performs straightforward data comparison using a third-party library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'daff' library, which is used for data diffing. Two datasets are statically defined within the script, representing country and capital data. The diff operation is performed, and assertions check the structure of the diff result. The code appears to be a simple data comparison task with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The only external dependency is 'daff', which is a known library for data differencing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data comparison script utilizing the 'daff' library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
