{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'daff' library and performs a diff operation between two datasets containing country and capital information.",
  "sources": "Data is defined within the script in the variables 'data1' and 'data2'. The only source of external data is the imported 'daff' library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, system compromise, or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining data variables, importing the 'daff' library, executing 'daff.diff' to compare the datasets, and performing assertions on the result.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and benign; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a known library 'daff' for dataset comparison, defines two datasets with country information, and computes their difference. The assertions verify the shape of the resulting diff object. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security risks. The use of 'assert' statements is standard for testing but not malicious. Overall, the code performs a simple dataset comparison with no suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses a standard library to compare datasets and includes basic assertions for validation. No vulnerabilities or malware are detected.",
