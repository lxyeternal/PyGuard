{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'daff' library to compare two tabular datasets (data1 and data2) and checks the resulting diff's dimensions.",
  "sources": "Data is defined within the script as lists of lists; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write to files, network, or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; data is statically defined and used locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a third-party library 'daff' without any suspicious imports or usage. It defines two datasets 'data1' and 'data2' with country and capital info, with 'data2' having an extra 'Code' column and additional entries. It performs a diff operation between these datasets, then asserts on the diff's dimensions. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious intent. No external input or output handling is involved, and the logic is clear and standard for dataset comparison.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign comparison of datasets using a third-party library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
