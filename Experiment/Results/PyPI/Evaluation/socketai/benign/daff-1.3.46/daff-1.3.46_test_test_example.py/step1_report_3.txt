{
  "purpose": "The code compares two datasets of countries and their capitals using the 'daff' library to identify differences.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays 'data1' and 'data2' defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No external data outputs or untrusted data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the defined input arrays to the 'daff.diff' function, with results stored in 'table_diff'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of 'assert' for validation is typical in testing but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'daff' library, defines two datasets representing countries and capitals, and computes their difference using 'daff.diff'. It then asserts expected dimensions of the resulting diff table. The code is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. 'daff' is a known library for diffing tabular data. The assertions serve to verify correct operation, typical in testing or validation scripts. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden code, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data comparison script that uses the 'daff' library to diff two datasets. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious anomalies, or security concerns identified. It appears to be a standard, harmless data processing snippet.",
