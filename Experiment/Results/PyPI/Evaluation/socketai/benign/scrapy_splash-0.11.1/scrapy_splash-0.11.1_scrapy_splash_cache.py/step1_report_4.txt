  "purpose": "Extend the Scrapy FilesystemCacheStorage to handle splash request meta key for HTTP cache, with deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import of splash_request_fingerprint, usage in _get_request_path method",
  "sinks": "os.path.join used to generate request cache file paths, no untrusted data directly processed here",
  "flows": "splash_request_fingerprint(request) generates a key used in filesystem path",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; deprecation warning is standard practice; no unusual or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The class extends Scrapy's cache storage to accommodate splash requests, utilizing a fingerprint function for request identification. The code issues a deprecation warning, which is standard for deprecated features. The request fingerprint is used solely for file path generation, with no untrusted data processed or transmitted. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a straightforward extension of a cache storage class with a deprecation warning and request path generation using a fingerprint. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
