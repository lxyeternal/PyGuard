  "purpose": "Defines custom Scrapy request classes for Splash rendering and fingerprinting, managing splash parameters and URL normalization.",
  "sources": "Input URLs, splash parameters, request meta data, headers, and user-provided arguments.",
  "sinks": "Request dispatching with splash rendering, fingerprinting cache keys, and URL normalization.",
  "flows": "Input data (URLs, headers, args) -> meta data -> splash request construction -> fingerprinting process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for integrating Splash with Scrapy, handling URL encoding, meta data, and request fingerprinting. It deep copies input data, normalizes URLs, and manages splash-specific parameters safely. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The fingerprinting class extends base fingerprinting with splash options, which is legitimate. The overall structure and logic are clear and consistent with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to user-controlled parameters, but no inherent vulnerabilities are present.",
