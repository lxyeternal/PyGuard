  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code to identify any discrepancies, potential risks, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code maps content types to response classes; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. The response class selection is based solely on headers, which is standard practice.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. The confidence is high (1). No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard response handling.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code is standard and safe.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. Confidence is high (1). No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on dynamic class selection based on headers; no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The code extends ResponseTypes, mapping content types to classes, with a simple override. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (a minimal, justifiable risk due to slight uncertainty). Confidence slightly lower (0.9), but overall safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard extension of response type handling.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, confidence 0.9. The slight risk accounts for the general nature of response class selection.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard response type mapping; no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports or the code itself indicate malicious behavior, such as executing untrusted code, network exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard Python constructs.\n- **Risk Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — minimal security risk, as the code only maps response types based on headers.\n\n---\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard implementation for response type handling in a web scraping context, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk concerns.**",
