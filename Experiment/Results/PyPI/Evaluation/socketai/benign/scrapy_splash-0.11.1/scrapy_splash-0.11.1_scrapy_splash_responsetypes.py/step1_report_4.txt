  "purpose": "Define custom response types for handling different content types in scrapy_splash, with dynamic response class selection.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, scrapy.http.Response, scrapy.responsetypes.ResponseTypes, and scrapy_splash.",
  "sinks": "Method from_args dynamically selecting response classes based on headers and other arguments.",
  "flows": "from_args method takes headers and other args, calls superclass method, and potentially modifies return class to scrapy_splash.SplashResponse.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ResponseTypes with a dictionary mapping content types to response classes. The from_args method uses superclass logic to select an appropriate class, then overrides it with SplashResponse if the result is Response. No untrusted data handling, network communication, or obfuscation present. The code's behavior appears standard for customizing response handling in scrapy_splash.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical extension of response type handling for a web scraping framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and purposeful.",
