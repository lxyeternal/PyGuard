  "purpose": "Define custom response types for handling different content types in scrapy_splash with dynamic class selection.",
  "sources": "Headers, url, filename, and body parameters in from_args method.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data is used in a harmful manner or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Headers, url, filename, body -> from_args -> super().from_args -> possible override to SplashResponse.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The class mainly maps content types to response classes.",
  "analysis": "The code extends ResponseTypes to specify custom response classes for various content types, utilizing a mapping dictionary. The from_args method delegates to the superclass for response class determination and overrides the default to a SplashResponse if Response is returned. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger framework for handling responses in scrapy_splash. No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard extension for response type handling in scrapy_splash, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for its purpose without introducing vulnerabilities.",
