{
  "purpose": "Defines custom response types for scrapy_splash integration, primarily mapping content types to response classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from header arguments and possibly from body, headers, and URL parameters in the from_args method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the from_args method returns different Response classes based on headers; however, this is standard behavior. No sinks are directly executing untrusted code or data.",
  "flows": "Headers are passed to from_args, which determines the response class; no external data is fetched or executed in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward class and method definitions for response type mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a mapping of content types to response classes in a dictionary. The from_args method infers the response class based on headers and other parameters. It uses standard inheritance and class resolution, with no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or obfuscated constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation for mapping HTTP content types to response classes in a scrapy_splash context. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal.",
