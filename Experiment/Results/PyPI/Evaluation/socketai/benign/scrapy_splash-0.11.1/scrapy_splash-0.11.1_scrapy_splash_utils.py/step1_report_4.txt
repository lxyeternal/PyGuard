  "purpose": "Utility functions for hashing, header conversion, and parsing in web scraping contexts.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function arguments such as objects for hashing, headers input for conversion, and header strings for parsing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; functions process data locally for hashing and conversion without network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through hashing or conversion functions, with no external or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of standard libraries and practices. No obfuscated code, no unusual behaviors, or hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for hashing data structures with SHA-1, converting headers between formats, and parsing headers. It uses standard libraries (hashlib, json, six, scrapy) appropriately, with no suspicious dynamic code execution or network activity. All functions operate locally on input data, with straightforward logic. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or privacy violations. The use of hash functions is for data integrity or identification, not for malicious data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears to be benign and intended for utility purposes in web scraping or data processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for hashing, header conversion, and parsing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe, standard, and intended for legitimate use cases in web scraping applications.",
