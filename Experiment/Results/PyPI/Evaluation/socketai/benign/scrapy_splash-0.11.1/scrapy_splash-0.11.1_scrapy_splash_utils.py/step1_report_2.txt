  "purpose": "Utility functions for hashing, headers processing, and parsing in web scraping and data handling tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as 'headers' in 'headers_to_scrapy', 'value' in 'parse_x_splash_saved_arguments_header', and objects passed to hashing functions.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation results, header conversions, and parsed dictionaries, which are used internally and returned; no external data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into hash functions or parsing functions; hashes or converted headers are returned, with no external data transmissions or unsafe operations detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors identified. Use of standard libraries and straightforward data processing functions; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements hashing for dicts and JSON serializable objects, header conversions between formats, and parsing of specific header values. It uses hashlib for cryptographic hashes, processes input data carefully, and caches hash results for efficiency. No data exfiltration, network activity, or security-critical vulnerabilities are present. The functions appear designed for data integrity, deduplication, or request handling, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data processing and headers management with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any malware or suspicious logic, serving typical data handling purposes within web scraping or similar contexts.",
