{
  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'scrapy-splash' Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and description files ('README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst') from the filesystem.",
  "targets": "None of the code directly processes untrusted input; it primarily loads static files and sets package info.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as no untrusted data flows into critical security-sensitive functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of open() for reading description files is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. It reads README and CHANGES files for long description, which is typical. No code injection, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies are fixed and known. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware or security risks. The use of open() to read description files is safe as it only reads static, local files. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
