{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'scrapy-splash' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads external files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description, and includes hardcoded package and dependency information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; the code only processes static package metadata.",
  "flows": "Input from files ('README.rst', 'CHANGES.rst') flows into the 'long_description' parameter, but these are static files used during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata. It reads description files, sets package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. Usage of 'open()' to read files is typical for setup scripts. All data involved is static or from trusted sources within the package environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are detected.",
