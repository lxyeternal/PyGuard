      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign extension for Scrapy's cache system, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The deprecation warning is a maintenance note, not a security concern. The request fingerprinting approach is standard and safe, assuming the external function is secure. The security risk score is very low, and malware score is zero, consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for request fingerprinting with splash support. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified mainly by deprecation warnings and maintenance considerations, not malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the code's clarity supports a high confidence in its benign nature."
