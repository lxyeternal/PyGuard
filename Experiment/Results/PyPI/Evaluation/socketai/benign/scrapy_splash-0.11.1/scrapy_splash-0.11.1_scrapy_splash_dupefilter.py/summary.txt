  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for request fingerprinting with splash support. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified mainly by deprecation warnings and maintenance considerations, not malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the code's clarity supports a high confidence in its benign nature."
