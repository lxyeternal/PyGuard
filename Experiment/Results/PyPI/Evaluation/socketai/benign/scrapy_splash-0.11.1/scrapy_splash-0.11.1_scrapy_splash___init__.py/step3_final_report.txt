  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only import statements for modules related to Splash, a web rendering framework, with no data processing, network activity, or executable logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: middleware, dupefilter, cache, response, request",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present; no network communication or data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules without processing data",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes and functions from internal modules related to Splash. There are no data flows, network interactions, or executable logic that could be malicious. The code is standard for setting up a Splash-based framework and does not contain any anomalies or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores should be set to 0, indicating no threat or suspicious activity.",
