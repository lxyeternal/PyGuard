  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting cookies between Python CookieJar and HAR format",
  "sources": "Reading cookie data from CookieJar, HAR cookie dictionaries, and input parameters",
  "sinks": "Creating Cookie objects, setting and clearing cookies in CookieJar, converting to HAR format",
  "flows": "Cookie data is read from input sources, converted, and then stored or removed in CookieJar; cookie attributes are processed for format conversion",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious comments, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward cookie data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie serialization/deserialization and CookieJar management functions. It processes cookie attributes including expiration, domain, path, and security flags. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The functions rely on standard libraries and well-defined cookie handling logic. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are present. Overall, this appears to be legitimate utility code for cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling cookies and does not contain malware or malicious intent. It performs expected conversions and cookie management without any suspicious behavior.",
