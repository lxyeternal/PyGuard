  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting cookies between CookieJar and HAR formats, and managing cookie attributes.",
  "sources": "Reading cookie dictionaries in HAR format, accessing Cookie attributes, and cookie jar management functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "HAR cookie dict to Cookie object conversion; Cookie object to HAR dict; adding/removing cookies in CookieJar based on HAR data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard cookie handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for cookie serialization/deserialization and management. It does not include network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The logic is clear, with proper handling of cookie attributes and expiration times. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0–0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for cookie handling with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
