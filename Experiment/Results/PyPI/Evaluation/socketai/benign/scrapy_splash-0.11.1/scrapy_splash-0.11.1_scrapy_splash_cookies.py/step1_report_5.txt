  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between CookieJar and HAR cookie formats and manipulating cookies",
  "sources": "None of the functions read untrusted input directly; the code processes cookie data passed as arguments",
  "sinks": "The functions modify and set cookies in CookieJar objects; no data leakage or external communication occurs",
  "flows": "Input cookie data (har_cookies, request_cookies) -> Conversion functions -> CookieJar manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic, no obfuscation, and no external network communication or data exfiltration observed",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to convert cookie data between formats and manage cookies within a CookieJar object. It parses expiration dates, manages cookie attributes, and handles cookie removal if needed. All operations are contained within the scope of cookie management and format conversion. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior. The code relies on standard libraries and third-party modules for cookie handling and time management, with no external communication or data exfiltration points.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for cookie management. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use as part of a larger application.",
