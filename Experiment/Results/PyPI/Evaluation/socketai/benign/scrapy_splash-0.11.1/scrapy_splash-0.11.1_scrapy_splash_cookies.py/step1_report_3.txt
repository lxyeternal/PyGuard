  "purpose": "Utilities for converting and managing cookies between CookieJar and HAR format",
  "sources": "Reading cookie data from CookieJar, HAR cookie dictionaries, and input parameters (har_cookies, request_cookies)",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily processes data without executing untrusted input or producing side effects like network connections",
  "flows": "Cookie data is read from input parameters, converted between formats, and manipulated within cookiejar",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed; the code does not perform any network or system modifications",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for converting cookies between CookieJar objects and HAR cookie dictionaries, including handling expiry, domain, path, and security flags. It includes safe data handling and does not execute any untrusted input in a harmful manner. No indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The functions are straightforward data transformations with no network, file, or environment variable exploitation. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for cookie management with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and does not perform any harmful operations.",
