  "purpose": "Middleware for Scrapy handling Splash requests, managing cookies, request deduplication, and response processing.",
  "sources": "Request meta data, request headers, request body, response data, environment variables for credentials.",
  "sinks": "Modifies request headers, request body, request meta, response data, and cookies.",
  "flows": "Request meta -> request headers/body -> Splash server -> response data -> middleware cookies and deduplication logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Warnings about internal state are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Splash middleware functions: cookie management, request deduplication, request modification, and response handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets. The environment variables for credentials are standard practice but should be managed securely. The logic is consistent, and no suspicious external connections or payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of Splash middleware for Scrapy, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting general risks associated with external service interaction, not malicious activity.",
