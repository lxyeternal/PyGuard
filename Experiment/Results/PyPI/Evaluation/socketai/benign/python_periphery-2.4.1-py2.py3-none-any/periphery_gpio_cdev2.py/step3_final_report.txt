{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Linux GPIO control interface via ioctl calls using ctypes structures, allowing reading, writing, configuration, and event handling for GPIO lines.",
  "sources": "Device files (/dev/gpiochipX), ioctl system calls, data structures for GPIO info and events.",
  "sinks": "Hardware GPIO lines; no untrusted data flows into system commands or leaks outside hardware control.",
  "flows": "Input parameters validated, then ioctl calls modify or retrieve GPIO states; no external data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious code patterns or covert channels.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Linux ioctl interfaces with ctypes for GPIO management, including validation of parameters, resource management, and error handling. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or covert operations. The structure and logic are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Linux GPIO control module with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond standard hardware interaction. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.2).",
