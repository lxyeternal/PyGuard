{
  "purpose": "The code implements a sysfs-based GPIO interface for Linux, managing GPIO export, direction, value, and edge configurations via filesystem interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads from and writes to files such as /sys/class/gpio/export, /sys/class/gpio/unexport, /sys/class/gpio/gpioX/direction, value, edge, and active_low.",
  "sinks": "Writes to files for exporting/unexporting GPIOs, setting direction, edge, active_low, and writing to the value file; reads from these files for status and configuration.",
  "flows": "Source: export/unexport files, configuration files (direction, edge, active_low), and value file; Sink: configuration writes and value writes; Flow involves filesystem operations for GPIO setup and control.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no network activity, no hidden code or backdoors. Error handling and retries are standard. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GPIO management via sysfs with proper validation, error handling, and retries. It does not contain obfuscation, network activity, or malicious logic. The interaction with filesystem files is typical for hardware control modules. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The low scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured sysfs GPIO interface with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks beyond inherent filesystem manipulation. The low risk score reflects typical hardware control risks but no malicious activity.",
