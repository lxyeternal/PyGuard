{
  "purpose": "This code manages sysfs LEDs on Linux systems, allowing control of LED brightness through a Python interface.",
  "sources": "Data sources include reading 'max_brightness' from sysfs files and reading/writing to the 'brightness' file for the LED.",
  "sinks": "Data written to 'brightness' file via os.write; no direct untrusted data sinks used for network or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input from user parameters (name, brightness) flows into file operations; no external network or system command execution present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. Proper input validation for name and brightness. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code properly opens and reads sysfs LED attributes, sets brightness with validation, and handles resources safely. It uses standard file operations and exception handling. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external network access. The code appears to be a legitimate hardware control implementation with appropriate safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured LED control class for Linux sysfs with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard hardware interface module with proper validation and error handling.",
