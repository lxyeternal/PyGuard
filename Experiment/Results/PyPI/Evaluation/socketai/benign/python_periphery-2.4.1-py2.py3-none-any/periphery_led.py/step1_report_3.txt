  "purpose": "The code manages and controls a Linux sysfs LED device by opening, reading, and writing brightness levels, and handling resource management.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem: '/sys/class/leds/{name}/max_brightness' and '/sys/class/leds/{name}/brightness'; input parameters for initialization and brightness setting.",
  "sinks": "Writes to the filesystem: '/sys/class/leds/{name}/brightness'; file descriptor writes for setting brightness.",
  "flows": "Initialization reads max_brightness, possibly sets brightness; read() retrieves current brightness; write() updates brightness; close() releases file descriptor.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Uses standard sysfs interface without obfuscated code. No network activity, reverse shells, or data exfiltration observed. No unusual or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for controlling Linux LEDs via sysfs. It performs filesystem operations to read maximum brightness and write current brightness levels. Error handling is comprehensive, catching IO errors. No user input is directly read; all parameters are passed during instantiation or method calls. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic detected. The code adheres to common practices for sysfs interaction and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for controlling system LEDs on Linux. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for device control without involving network activity or sensitive data handling.",
