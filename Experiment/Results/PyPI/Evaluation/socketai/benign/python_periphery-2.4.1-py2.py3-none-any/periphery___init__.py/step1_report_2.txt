{
  "purpose": "Provides sleep utility functions and imports peripheral interface classes for hardware control.",
  "sources": "time module for sleep functions; periphery library for GPIO, LED, PWM, SPI, I2C, MMIO, serial interfaces.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data or could leak data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; sleep functions are straightforward wrappers; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple sleep functions with clear, standard implementations. It imports classes from the 'periphery' library, which is a common hardware interface library used in embedded systems. There are no indications of code obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or data leaks. No input or untrusted data sources are processed, and no dangerous functions are called with untrusted inputs. The code appears to be standard utility and hardware interface setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and straightforward, serving as utility functions for sleeping and importing hardware interface modules. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
