{
  "purpose": "Provides sleep utility functions and imports various hardware control modules from the periphery library.",
  "sources": "time.sleep() calls and import statements for hardware interfaces (periphery modules).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or potentially dangerous functions executed.",
  "flows": "Input data (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds) flows into time.sleep() functions; import statements load external modules without executing code flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward sleep functions and standard library/module imports without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple sleep functions that delegate to time.sleep(), with parameters for seconds, milliseconds, and microseconds. These functions are standard utility wrappers and do not process untrusted input directly within the code. The import statements load hardware interface modules from the 'periphery' library, which is used for hardware control in embedded systems. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears clean, functional, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module providing sleep functions and importing hardware control libraries. No malicious intent, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
