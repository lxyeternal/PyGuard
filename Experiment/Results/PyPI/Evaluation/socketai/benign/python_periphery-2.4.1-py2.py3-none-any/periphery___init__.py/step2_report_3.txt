  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The functions are simple wrappers around `time.sleep()`, and the imports are from a well-known hardware interface library (`periphery`).  \n   **Conclusion:** No malicious code detected. Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Flaws:**  \n   The code is simple, with no evident flaws or security issues. The sleep functions are standard, and the imported modules are typical for embedded/hardware projects.  \n   **Conclusion:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All assign 0, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk Score (General Security Risk):**  \n   Since the code performs no dangerous operations, processes no untrusted data, and only imports hardware modules, the overall security risk should be minimal. The highest score assigned is 0.1 in some reports, but given the context, a conservative but appropriate score would be **0.0**.\n\n5. **Potential for Hidden Threats or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no hidden malicious intent or suspicious assumptions.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module for sleep functions and hardware interface imports. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code’s nature.\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the current scoring accurately reflects the security posture of this code snippet.",
