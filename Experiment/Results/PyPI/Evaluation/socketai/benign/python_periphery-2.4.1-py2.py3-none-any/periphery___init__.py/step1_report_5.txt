{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for sleeping/delaying execution and import hardware interface modules from the periphery library.",
  "sources": "time.sleep() calls; import statements for hardware interfaces from periphery library.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Sleep functions invoke time.sleep() with sanitized arguments; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for such utility functions and hardware imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple sleep functions that wrap the standard time.sleep() method, with no input validation or external data handling, which is typical and safe. The import statements load hardware interface modules from the periphery library, which are used for hardware interaction; these imports alone do not imply malicious intent. The code contains no hidden code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign, providing utility functions and importing hardware modules without any malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility and import module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
