{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for sleeping in various units and hardware interface imports from the 'periphery' library, intended for embedded system control.",
  "sources": "Functions 'sleep', 'sleep_ms', 'sleep_us' reading input via function arguments; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow directly into 'time.sleep()' without validation; no malicious or suspicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward sleep utility functions and imports standard hardware interface classes from 'periphery'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The functions are simple wrappers, and the imported modules are common in embedded hardware projects. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for hardware timing and control, with no malicious or security risks detected. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
