{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for pausing execution for specified durations and imports modules related to hardware control peripherals.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the function arguments for sleep functions; module imports from 'periphery' for hardware interfacing.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present. The sleep functions are benign, and imported modules are standard hardware interface libraries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments (sleep durations) to time.sleep() calls, which are benign. Imported modules are loaded without executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple sleep functions for different time units and imports a set of hardware interface modules from the 'periphery' library. The sleep functions use the standard time.sleep(), which is safe. The imported modules are typical for embedded or hardware-interfacing Python projects and do not indicate malicious intent. No user input handling, external data processing, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with hardware interface imports and sleep functions. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
