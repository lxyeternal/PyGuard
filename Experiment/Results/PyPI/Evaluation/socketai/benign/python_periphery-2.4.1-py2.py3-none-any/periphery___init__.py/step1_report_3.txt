{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for sleeping for specified durations and import various hardware interface classes from the periphery library.",
  "sources": "time module functions, import statements from periphery library",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data being processed, transmitted, or exposed",
  "flows": "No significant data flows; only function definitions and imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The sleep functions are straightforward wrappers around time.sleep(). The imported modules are standard hardware interface classes, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple sleep functions with clear purposes, wrapping time.sleep() for milliseconds and microseconds. It imports hardware interface classes from the periphery library, which are typical for hardware interaction in embedded systems. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for hardware control and timing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The sleep functions are standard wrappers, and the import statements are typical for hardware control in embedded systems. No suspicious behavior or malware indicators are present.",
