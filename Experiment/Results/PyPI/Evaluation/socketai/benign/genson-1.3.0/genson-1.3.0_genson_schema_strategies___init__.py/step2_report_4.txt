  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from sibling modules, defines a tuple of basic schema strategies, and sets `__all__` for exports.\n- No external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or user input handling are present.\n- The code appears to serve as an API or index module within a schema validation framework.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are detected.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, structural, and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is simple, static, and does not perform any risky operations.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The code functions as intended for its purpose.\n\n### Logical reasoning and scoring:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n\n- Since there is no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risk, the scores are reasonable.\n- The high confidence (1.0) across reports supports the conclusion that the code is safe.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly dismiss any vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the code is static and lacks dynamic or external inputs.\n- **Potential for malicious activity:** None evident; the code is purely import/export declarations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious behavior detected                               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear, straightforward, and non-obfuscated          |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No external data handling, network, or risky operations     |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple module that imports schema classes, groups some into a tuple, and exports them via `__all__`.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and functions as intended within a schema validation framework.",
