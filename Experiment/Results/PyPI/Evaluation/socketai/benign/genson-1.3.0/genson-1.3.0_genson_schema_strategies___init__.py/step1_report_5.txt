{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a schema validation or data structure definition library, exporting various schema strategy classes and constants.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from the same package: .base, .scalar, .array, and .object. It does not read external input, environment variables, or user data.",
  "sinks": "The code only defines and exports constants and class references; there are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external inputs or outputs; the code only imports and defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code structure is straightforward and standard for Python package exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from sibling modules, defines a tuple of basic schema strategies, and sets __all__ for module exports. It functions as an index or API export module without executing complex logic or handling untrusted data. No suspicious behavior, external data handling, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module export file for a schema validation library. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious data handling, and presents no security risks. Its purpose is to organize and expose classes and constants.",
