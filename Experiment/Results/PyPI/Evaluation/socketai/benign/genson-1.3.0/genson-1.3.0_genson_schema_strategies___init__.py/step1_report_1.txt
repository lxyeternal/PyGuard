{
  "purpose": "Define and export schema strategy classes and basic data types for schema validation or processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.base, .scalar, .array, .object) which likely contain class definitions and logic.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code only imports and defines constants and __all__ for exports.",
  "flows": "Imports flow from module files to local namespace; no external data flows or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. The code appears to be straightforward definitions and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several schema-related classes and functions from sibling modules, defines a tuple of basic schema strategies, and specifies __all__ for module exports. It serves as a module interface, organizing and exposing schema-related components. No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code structure is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an import/export module for schema strategies and data types, with no evidence of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a larger schema validation framework.",
