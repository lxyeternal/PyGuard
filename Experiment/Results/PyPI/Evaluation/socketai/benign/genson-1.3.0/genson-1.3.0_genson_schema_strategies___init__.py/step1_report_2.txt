{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports various schema strategy classes and constants related to data validation or serialization frameworks.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and constants from internal modules (.base, .scalar, .array, .object). There are no external input sources or untrusted data reads present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive operations; the code mainly sets up class references and a tuple of schema components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code consists solely of class imports, a tuple, and an __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports schema-related classes from local modules and aggregates certain classes into a tuple named BASIC_SCHEMA_STRATEGIES. It then defines __all__ to specify module exports. There are no user inputs, network calls, or data processing. The code appears to be part of a larger data validation framework, and no malicious behavior or security issues are evident based on this isolated fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that organizes and exports schema strategy classes. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions as a setup or configuration component within a larger project.",
