{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for building and managing JSON schemas, including schema merging, object addition, and schema serialization.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include objects passed to add_schema() and add_object(), and class attributes such as EXTRA_STRATEGIES and schema_uri.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are methods that serialize data, such as to_json() which outputs JSON strings, and add_schema() which processes schemas that may contain untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (objects and schemas) into internal schema representations, and then can be serialized into JSON via to_json() or to_schema().",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deprecated methods (to_dict()) with warnings, but no suspicious code patterns or backdoors are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages JSON schema structures, allowing merging and serialization. It performs type checks (e.g., NODE_CLASS subclass), and manipulates schema dictionaries. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The class hierarchy and schema processing are straightforward. Deprecated warnings are harmless and unrelated to malicious intent. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a schema builder for JSON schemas with standard methods and safe practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured schema management code without malicious intent.",
