{
  "purpose": "This code implements a schema builder for JSON schemas, allowing merging, serialization, and object addition. It primarily constructs schema representations without executing external code or network activity.",
  "sources": "Input data from add_schema, add_object, and internal schema definitions; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Serialization via json.dumps() of the schema output; no data leaks or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input schemas and objects flow into the internal schema nodes, which are then combined and serialized into JSON; no external or malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class creation for schema nodes, which is standard metaprogramming, not obfuscation or malicious behavior. No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a JSON schema builder, with class inheritance, schema merging, and serialization. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The dynamic class creation is a common pattern in schema libraries, not malicious obfuscation. Deprecated warnings are benign. The code handles untrusted data cautiously, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured schema management utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The overall security assessment is that the package is safe for use.",
