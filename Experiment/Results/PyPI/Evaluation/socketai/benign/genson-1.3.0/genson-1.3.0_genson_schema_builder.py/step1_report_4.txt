{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for building and managing JSON schemas, including schema merging, object addition, and schema serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports json, warnings, and local modules (.node, .strategies); reads class attributes, method parameters, and object properties.",
  "sinks": "Calls to json.dumps() for JSON serialization, attribute access/modification (e.g., schema['$schema']), and dynamic class creation.",
  "flows": "Input data (schemas, objects) flows into methods like add_schema and add_object; data is processed and eventually passed to json.dumps() in to_json.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class creation for NODE_CLASS; deprecated warnings indicating transition; no evident obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a schema management library with class inheritance, dynamic class creation, and schema merging functionalities. It does not execute untrusted input directly or execute code dynamically beyond class creation. JSON serialization is straightforward. The only potential concern is the dynamic creation of classes with variable names, which is standard and not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network operations, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of warnings for deprecated features is benign and aimed at user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema management utility with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It performs schema creation, merging, and serialization safely without executing untrusted data or malicious code. No malware signals are detected.",
