{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for building JSON schemas, allowing schema creation, modification, and serialization. It manages schema strategies, supports schema merging, and offers deprecated backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data mainly through method parameters such as 'schema', 'obj', and class attributes like 'EXTRA_STRATEGIES' and 'NODE_CLASS'. It also reads class attributes and inherited strategies during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "Data is serialized to JSON via json.dumps in to_json(). Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is improperly added to schemas, but no unsafe data handling or network transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Input sources like 'schema' and 'obj' flow into 'add_schema' and 'add_object' methods, modifying internal schema nodes, which then produce JSON schemas. No external network or system command flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code. Deprecated warnings indicate legacy code but do not pose security risks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs schema management classes with methods for merging schemas and objects, generating JSON outputs, and handling schema strategies. Class inheritance and dynamic class creation are used but are standard. No external calls, network activity, or suspicious data handling are present. The code includes deprecation warnings but no malicious or malicious-looking code segments. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema builder framework with standard features and deprecated legacy support. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
