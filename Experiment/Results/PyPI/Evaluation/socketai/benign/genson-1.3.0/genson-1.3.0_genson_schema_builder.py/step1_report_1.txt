{
  "purpose": "The code implements a schema builder for JSON schemas, allowing addition of schemas and objects, and outputting schemas in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include schemas added via add_schema() and objects added via add_object(). Data is read from method parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include json.dumps() in to_json() which serializes the schema, and manipulation of schemas/objects which could include malicious data.",
  "flows": "Input schemas or objects flow into internal schema representations and are eventually serialized into JSON strings via json.dumps().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of deprecated warnings indicates transitional code but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for building JSON schemas, with mechanisms for merging schemas and objects. The only potentially notable aspect is the use of warnings for deprecated features, which is standard. There are no evident data leaks, malicious network activity, or obfuscation. The json.dumps() function is used for serialization, which is common. The code does not perform any insecure operations such as executing untrusted code, network connections, or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward schema builder without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a schema generation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly constructs and serializes JSON schemas. No malicious or supply chain attack vectors are detected.",
