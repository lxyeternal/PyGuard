  "purpose": "Define base classes for schema strategies used for validation and type matching.",
  "sources": "None (code appears to be defining classes and methods, no external data input).",
  "sinks": "None (no functions that execute untrusted input, no data leaks or external communications).",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; usage of 'warn' is standard for warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes for schema validation strategies, with methods for matching schemas and objects, adding schemas, and converting schemas to dictionary form. It includes subclassing for specific types with class constants for type identification. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is structured for schema management, not for malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured implementation of schema strategy classes with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
