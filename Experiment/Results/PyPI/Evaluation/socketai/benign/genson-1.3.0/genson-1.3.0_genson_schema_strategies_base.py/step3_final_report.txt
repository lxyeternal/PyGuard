{
  "purpose": "Defines schema strategy classes for schema validation and extension, providing an interface for matching schemas and objects, and managing schema keywords.",
  "sources": "Class methods and attributes, particularly 'match_schema', 'match_object', and 'add_schema' methods, as well as class constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (schemas and objects) flow through 'match_schema' and 'match_object' methods; conflicts are handled via warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'warnings.warn' during schema conflicts; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of schema strategy classes with inheritance, class methods, and warnings. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The warnings are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose is schema management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for schema validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
