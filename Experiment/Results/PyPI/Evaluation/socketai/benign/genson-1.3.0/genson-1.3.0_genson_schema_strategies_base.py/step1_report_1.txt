{
  "purpose": "Define base classes for schema strategies with methods for schema validation and manipulation.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading mechanisms present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network communication, file operations, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily class definitions and method logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for schema handling, including methods for schema comparison, extension, and type matching. It uses standard Python features such as class inheritance, class methods, and warnings. No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or potentially dangerous operations are present. The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or system commands, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of schema strategy classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard, benign utility module related to schema management.",
