{
  "purpose": "The code defines a schema generator class for creating JSON schemas based on input objects and existing schemas, facilitating schema management and merging.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input parameters such as `schema` and `obj` in methods `add_schema` and `add_object`, which accept external data (dicts or SchemaNode instances).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include method calls that process schemas and objects, but no direct data leakage, network transmission, or file modification is present. No insecure evaluations or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources (input schemas and objects) flow into schema processing methods, which select strategies and modify internal state (`_active_strategies`). These strategies generate schemas and combine results, but no external or unsafe data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily manages schema structures and strategy selection, with no unusual or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically manages JSON schema generation via strategies, handling schema merging, object-based schema creation, and schema conversion. It employs strategy pattern techniques to select appropriate schema strategies. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious backdoors, is detected. The code’s operations are straightforward and related to schema management. No obfuscation or hidden logic is present, and external data is handled securely via method parameters. No network access, file operations, or system calls are used that could indicate malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign schema management utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It strictly handles schema data structures and strategy selection without performing any harmful operations. Security risks are minimal, and no malware signals are evident.",
