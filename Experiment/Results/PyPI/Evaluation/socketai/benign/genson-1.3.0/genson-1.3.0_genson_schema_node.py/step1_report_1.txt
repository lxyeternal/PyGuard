{
  "purpose": "This code defines a schema generator class for building JSON schemas from objects and existing schemas, facilitating schema merging and type inference.",
  "sources": "Method inputs: schemas passed to add_schema(), objects passed to add_object(), internal method calls with schema or object data.",
  "sinks": "Calls to strategy methods such as add_schema() and add_object(), which may process data; no external network or system operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through add_schema() and add_object(), then through strategy matching and processing functions, eventually generating schema representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily handles data structures and strategy management without external side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports strategies and defines a schema generator class with methods to add schemas and objects, converting internal state to a JSON schema. It employs strategy pattern matching for schema types. No suspicious code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code functions as a typical schema builder with no apparent malicious intent. It lacks network operations, system modifications, or obfuscated code. The flow is straightforward, involving data merging and transformation. No anomalies or indicators of sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate schema generation utility without malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations, contain hardcoded secrets, or exhibit malicious patterns.",
