{
  "purpose": "The code implements a schema generator class that manages JSON schemas through strategies, allowing merging schemas and objects, and converting internal schemas to JSON Schema format.",
  "sources": "Input schemas and objects provided to methods add_schema and add_object; internal strategy matching functions.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network activity, or file operations; data flows are confined within data structure manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input schemas/objects -> strategy matching -> schema merging or object addition -> internal schema state -> to_schema output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard design patterns (strategy pattern) for schema management, with internal methods for handling nested schemas and type inference. It does not perform any external system interactions, network calls, or file manipulations. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on schema merging and conversion, with appropriate error handling. The imported strategies are external dependencies assumed benign, and the code’s data flow is internal and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured schema management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
