  "purpose": "Define various schema strategies for JSON schema validation, including handling of 'null', 'boolean', 'string', and 'number' types.",
  "sources": "Class method calls, class attribute references, and input parameters such as 'schema' and 'obj'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to external systems or handles untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code checks 'schema' dictionaries for 'type' values and processes objects accordingly, with methods determining schema-object compatibility and constructing schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed. The code primarily performs standard schema matching and conversion logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes implementing schema strategies for JSON data validation, including 'Null', 'Boolean', 'String', and 'Number'. It performs type checks and schema conversions. The methods are straightforward, and no external network, file, or sensitive data handling is present. The code relies on standard Python features, such as type checking and dictionary access, without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of schema validation strategies without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code only performs schema type matching and conversion logic.",
