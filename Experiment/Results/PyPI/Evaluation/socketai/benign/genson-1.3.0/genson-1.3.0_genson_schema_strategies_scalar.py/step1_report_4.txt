  "purpose": "Defines schema strategy classes for handling different JSON schema types, including null, boolean, string, and number, for validation and conversion purposes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method implementations within the module, including class variables, method parameters, and inherited methods.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as super().__init__, add_schema, add_object, and to_schema, which handle schema data, and potential data flows through these methods.",
  "flows": "Input data (schemas and objects) is processed through match_schema, match_object, add_schema, add_object, and to_schema methods, modifying internal state accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Code uses standard class inheritance and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides schema strategy classes for JSON schema validation, including Null, Boolean, String, and Number types. Methods like match_schema and match_object correctly identify schema types and objects. The Number class converts integer schemas to number schemas when appropriate, and updates internal type state based on input objects. All methods utilize standard Python features and inheritance, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flows. No external network activity, data leakage, or security risks are evident from this isolated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of schema strategies for JSON validation, with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected type matching and schema generation functions using typical Python patterns.",
