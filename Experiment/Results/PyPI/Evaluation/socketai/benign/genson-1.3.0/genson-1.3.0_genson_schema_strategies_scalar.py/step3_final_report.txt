  "purpose": "Defines schema strategies for JSON schema validation, including matching schemas/objects and converting schemas based on data types.",
  "sources": "Schema definitions and object instances used for validation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal schema and object processing only.",
  "flows": "Schema matching and object type checking within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard schema validation classes with methods for matching schemas and objects, and converting schemas based on object types. It contains no external I/O, network activity, or malicious logic. The logic is straightforward, with typical use of class inheritance and type checking. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code aligns with common schema validation patterns and does not perform any potentially harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of JSON schema strategies with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
