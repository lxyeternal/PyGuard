{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module intended for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not contain clear input reading functions such as input(), file reads, or environment variable access.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs like print statements or network calls, but none are clearly present or suspicious in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows are identified; the code mainly contains definitions and standard operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are apparent. The code is straightforward, with no unusual language features or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python functions and class definitions without any embedded network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated segments are detected. There are no suspicious variable names or logic patterns. The overall structure appears legitimate and benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It seems to be a benign, standard Python utility or module code. Due to lack of suspicious elements, confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
