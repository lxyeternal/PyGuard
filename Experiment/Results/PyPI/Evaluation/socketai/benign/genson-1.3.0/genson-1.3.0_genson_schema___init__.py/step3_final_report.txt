{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility or sample module with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads from environment variables, user input, or imported modules, typical for utility scripts.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to processing functions, but no harmful or suspicious flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9), and malware score is 0. The security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. The code structure and patterns are consistent with safe utility modules. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The assessments across reports are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
