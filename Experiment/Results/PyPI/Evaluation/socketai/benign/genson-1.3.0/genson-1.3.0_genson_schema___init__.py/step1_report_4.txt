{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script, possibly for handling data or executing commands, but without specific context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network requests if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or data outputs such as print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions or operations, potentially reaching sinks like system calls or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. Unusual constructs such as dynamic code execution (e.g., eval), obfuscated variable names, or excessive use of indirect calls could be suspicious, but none are evident from the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code structure was reviewed thoroughly. It does not contain obvious malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or destructive operations. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected based on the visible code. The purpose remains generic, and without specific input/output operations, no malicious flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
