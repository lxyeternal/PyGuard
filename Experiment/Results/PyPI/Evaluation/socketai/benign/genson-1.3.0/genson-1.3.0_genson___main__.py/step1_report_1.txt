  "purpose": "Command-line interface for generating a unified JSON Schema from JSON objects and schemas, with options for input handling, encoding, and output formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified via command-line arguments, standard input, and embedded in the code via sys.stdin.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.loads to parse JSON data, outputs schema as JSON via print. No direct data leaks or untrusted data effects evident.",
  "flows": "Input files → _call_with_json_from_fp methods → json.loads parsing → builder methods → print output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses re.split to split JSON strings with lookaround regex, which is a common approach but can be error-prone for complex JSON data. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed. The code reads from sys.stdin when no files are provided, but this is standard. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a CLI for processing JSON schemas and objects, handling file input, encoding, and delimiters. It uses standard libraries (argparse, sys, re, json) without any suspicious or malicious functions. The regex used for splitting JSON strings is conventional for such purposes, not obfuscated or malicious. No external network connections, system modifications, or malicious payloads are present. The code manages input and output securely without evident vulnerabilities or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for JSON schema generation, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Security risks are minimal and typical for a CLI data processing tool.",
