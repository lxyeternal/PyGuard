  "purpose": "Command-line interface for generating a unified JSON Schema from JSON objects and schemas, combining multiple inputs into one schema.",
  "sources": "Reads input JSON data from files specified with '-s' and positional arguments, and from stdin if no files are specified.",
  "sinks": "JSON data is parsed and then passed to methods of SchemaBuilder; output is printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input files are read and split into JSON strings, which are parsed into objects and passed to SchemaBuilder methods; output is printed as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to split JSON strings which might not handle all JSON edge cases properly, but no malicious pattern is present; no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a CLI for schema merging, reading JSON from files or stdin. JSON parsing is done via json.loads, which is standard and safe. The regex-based JSON string detection could potentially mishandle complex JSON, but no malicious intent is indicated. The code relies on a SchemaBuilder class, assumed to be safe, to process JSON objects and schemas. No network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The only potentially suspicious element is the regex for JSON boundary detection, which is standard for some CLI tools but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for JSON schema merging, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It reads JSON input, processes it, and outputs the result safely. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
