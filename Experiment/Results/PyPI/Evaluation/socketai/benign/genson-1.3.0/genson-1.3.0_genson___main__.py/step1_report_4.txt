{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for generating a unified JSON Schema from multiple JSON objects and schemas, combining them into a single schema output.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from files specified via command-line arguments or stdin, specifically JSON objects and schemas, and reads configuration options such as delimiter and encoding from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code processes JSON data by loading it into memory and printing the resulting schema to stdout. There are no sinks that send data over the network, write to sensitive locations, or execute external commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input data from files or stdin is read and split into JSON strings based on delimiters or detection regex, then parsed into JSON objects, which are added to the schema builder. The final schema is output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to perform standard CLI parsing, file reading, JSON processing, and schema generation without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries and techniques for CLI parsing, file handling, JSON parsing, and schema building. No network activity, credential management, or system modification functions are present. It handles JSON input carefully, with error handling for invalid JSON. The regex for splitting JSON objects is common for JSON boundary detection and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The design does not include any suspicious external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms. Overall, the code operates as a benign CLI utility for JSON schema generation, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for generating JSON schemas from input files and stdin, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It processes data securely and responsibly, with standard error handling and input parsing. There are no security risks identified in this review.",
