{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for generating a unified JSON Schema from multiple JSON objects and/or schemas, supporting various input options and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input is read from files specified via command-line arguments or from stdin if no files are provided; JSON data is loaded using json.loads().",
  "sinks": "JSON data is parsed with json.loads(), and the output is printed with print(). No sensitive data handling or external connections are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input data from files or stdin is processed through _get_json_strings(), then parsed via json.loads(), and finally added to a SchemaBuilder instance. Output is generated with print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses regex for JSON boundary detection, which is standard for multi-object parsing, not obfuscation or malicious intent. No external network connections, file tampering, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a CLI tool that reads JSON data, either from files or stdin, and processes them to produce a combined JSON schema. It handles multiple input options, including delimiters, encoding, and indentation. JSON parsing is performed safely with json.loads(). There are no evident signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The code structure appears typical for a CLI parser and JSON processing utility. Use of regex for splitting JSON objects is appropriate for multi-object files and does not indicate obfuscation. No external connections or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for schema generation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate open-source tool designed for JSON schema manipulation.",
