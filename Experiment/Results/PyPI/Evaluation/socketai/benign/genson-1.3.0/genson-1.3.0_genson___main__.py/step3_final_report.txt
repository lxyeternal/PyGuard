  "purpose": "A CLI tool for generating a unified JSON Schema from multiple JSON objects and schemas, reading from files or stdin.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from specified files, stdin, or command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.loads for parsing JSON; outputs the resulting schema with print.",
  "flows": "Input files or stdin → JSON parsing → SchemaBuilder methods → JSON output.",
  "anomalies": "Regex-based splitting of JSON objects, which is standard but can be fragile with complex JSON structures; no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that processes JSON inputs to produce a combined schema. It employs standard libraries and practices, with regex splitting for multiple JSON objects, which is common but not foolproof. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's behavior aligns with benign utility functions, and no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign open-source CLI tool for JSON schema generation. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
