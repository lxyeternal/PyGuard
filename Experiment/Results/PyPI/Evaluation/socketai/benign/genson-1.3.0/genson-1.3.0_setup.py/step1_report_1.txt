{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module execution context and imports setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; there are no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only calls setuptools.setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and standard for package setup. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools module and executes setuptools.setup() when run as the main program. It does not process any input data or perform any actions beyond initiating the package setup process. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical boilerplate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply invokes setuptools to package the project.",
