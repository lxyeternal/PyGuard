  "anomalies": "The code is minimalistic and standard for a setup script; no unusual or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls its setup() function within the main guard. There are no parameters, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no network operations. The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script for packaging Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic package configuration without any suspicious actions.",
