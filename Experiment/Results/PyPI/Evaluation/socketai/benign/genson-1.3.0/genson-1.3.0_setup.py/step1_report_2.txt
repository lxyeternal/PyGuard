  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and configure a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are read from external or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or outputs that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code simply calls a setup function without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for package setup, with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls its setup() function if run as the main module. This is a common pattern in Python package setup scripts. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code present. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or system modifications. It is a typical setup script used during package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
