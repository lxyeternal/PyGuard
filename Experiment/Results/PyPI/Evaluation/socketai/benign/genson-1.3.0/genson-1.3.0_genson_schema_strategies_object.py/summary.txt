  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a JSON schema handling class with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is overly cautious; a risk score of 0 is justified. No modifications are necessary; the assessments are accurate and consistent."
