{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for handling object schemas within a larger schema validation or processing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as 'schema' and 'obj', which are external data structures provided during method calls.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or files; it primarily processes internal data structures. No sinks indicate unsafe operations like network access, file I/O, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'schema' and 'obj' inputs into internal structures (_properties, _pattern_properties, _required). The methods 'add_schema' and 'add_object' process these inputs, updating internal states without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code uses standard library functions and straightforward data handling. No suspicious code execution or external communications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a schema handling class with methods to match, add, and convert schemas and objects. It processes schemas and data structures in a predictable manner, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or file manipulation. The logic appears focused on schema validation, with standard use of data structures like defaultdict, sets, and regex search for pattern matching. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured and follows common design patterns for schema management.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for managing object schemas within a validation framework. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors, no external communications, and no signs of obfuscation. It is safe and unlikely to pose security risks.",
