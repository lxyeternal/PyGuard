{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'Object' for handling JSON schema validation strategies, specifically for 'object' types, including adding schemas and objects, and converting internal representations back to schema form.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'add_object' method which takes a dictionary 'obj'. It also accesses schemas via 'add_schema'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted, and no external system calls or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries in 'add_object' to internal structures such as '_properties' and '_pattern_properties'. These are later converted back to schema via 'to_schema'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of schema handling with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a schema handling class that manages properties and pattern properties for 'object' JSON schema types. It uses standard data structures and methods to add schemas and objects, with no external calls, no dynamic code execution, and no network activities. The methods operate locally on data structures, and there is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The use of 'search' for regex pattern matching is safe and standard. Overall, this appears to be a benign, purpose-specific implementation for schema management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema strategy class with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves its purpose for schema validation and serialization without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
