{
  "purpose": "This code defines a schema strategy for handling 'object' types in a JSON schema validation or generation context.",
  "sources": "No explicit external data inputs; the code interacts with schema dictionaries and object data passed to methods like add_schema and add_object.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as add_schema, add_object, and to_schema process data; however, these are internal data manipulations with no apparent external data sinks that leak or exploit data.",
  "flows": "Schema data flows through add_schema to internal structures, object data flows through add_object into internal properties and pattern properties, with schema generation via to_schema producing output schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code relies on standard library functions and straightforward data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of a JSON schema object handler, managing properties, pattern properties, and required fields. It uses standard Python features like defaultdict and re.search for pattern matching. No external data is read in an insecure or suspicious manner. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or other malicious behaviors. The code's purpose appears to be schema management, with no evident signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign schema handling class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It employs standard Python features appropriately and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
