  "purpose": "This code implements a schema strategy for handling JSON objects, including schema validation, pattern matching, and schema generation.",
  "sources": "None, the code does not read external input or data sources directly. It operates on provided schema and object data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, networks, or files, nor does it execute untrusted code or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The code processes schema definitions and objects internally, performing pattern matching and schema construction. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of 'search' from 're' is safe for pattern matching. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The class defines schema handling for 'object' types, including adding schemas, matching objects, pattern matching with regex, and converting internal representations to schemas. The methods primarily manipulate data structures and perform pattern matching. No dangerous code execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The pattern matching uses 'search' in a controlled context, and no untrusted input is processed without validation. The code appears to be a standard schema handling implementation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a schema strategy for JSON object validation and serialization. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
