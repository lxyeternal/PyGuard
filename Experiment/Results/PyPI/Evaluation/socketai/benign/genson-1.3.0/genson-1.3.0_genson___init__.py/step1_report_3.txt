  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata and exports specific classes and errors for a schema management package.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and errors from relative module paths within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no data is being processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and then makes these available through the __all__ list; no data flows from untrusted sources or to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard module setup and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from internal modules, defines a version string, and declares an export list. There are no inputs, no data processing, no runtime behaviors, or external interactions that could be malicious. All operations are static, straightforward, and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module setup with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. It simply organizes exports for the package.",
