{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or index file, importing internal classes and constants, defining a version, and specifying exported symbols for package consumers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from internal modules and the version string; no external data or input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code is static and purely structural.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve static imports and symbol exports; no runtime data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements, version declaration, and an __all__ list, typical for a package's __init__.py. No dynamic execution, external data handling, network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure. The high confidence in this assessment is justified by the simplicity and standard structure of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module setup file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or risk adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
