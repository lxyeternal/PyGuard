{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export various classes and components related to schema handling, likely for a larger Python project involving data validation or schema management.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and constants from internal modules within the package, such as schema.builder, schema.node, and schema.strategies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; the code does not process external input or perform any data output. It only imports and exports internal components.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily sets up module exports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The version string is standard, and no malicious indicators are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific classes and constants from internal modules and defining the module's public API via __all__. There are no external data sources, user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The version number is static, and no potential security issues are visible in these import and export statements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module setup file that manages exports of internal schema-related classes and components. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
