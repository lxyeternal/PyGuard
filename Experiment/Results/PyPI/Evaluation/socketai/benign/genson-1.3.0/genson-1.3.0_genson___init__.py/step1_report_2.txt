{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports components related to schema building and strategies, likely for validation or data modeling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package, specifically from 'schema' submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted sources; only internal module references and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes and functions from internal modules, assigns a version string, and defines an __all__ list for export. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data handling that could introduce security risks. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py file or module definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward package initializer or module aggregator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes exports for internal components.",
