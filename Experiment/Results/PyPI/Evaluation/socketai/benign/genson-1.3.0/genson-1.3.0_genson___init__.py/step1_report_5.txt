{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports various classes and constants related to schema management, likely as part of a larger library or package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the package: .schema.builder, .schema.node, .schema.strategies.base",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports and exports classes and variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and constants from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It assigns a version string. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are visible. The code appears to be a typical module index or package init file, serving as an interface for other parts of the package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply consolidates and exposes internal components.",
