{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and imports for reading, writing, and handling STEM audio files, including utility functions for retrieving sample files and ffmpeg version information.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables and package resource files via pkg_resources, and executes subprocess commands (ffmpeg version check).",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess 'ffmpeg -version' and captures its output.",
  "flows": "subprocess.check_output -> processes command output to extract ffmpeg version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run 'ffmpeg -version' could be exploited if environment variables or command injection were possible, but in current form, it's a controlled call. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, utility functions to retrieve resource files, and a function to run 'ffmpeg -version' via subprocess. The subprocess call appears straightforward, with output parsing to extract the ffmpeg version. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Usage of pkg_resources for resource handling is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility library for handling STEM files and retrieving ffmpeg version info. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this module.",
