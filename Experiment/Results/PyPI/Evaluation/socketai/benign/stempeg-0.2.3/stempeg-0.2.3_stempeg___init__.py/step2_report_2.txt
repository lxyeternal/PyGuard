  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the described code with the provided source code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code primarily consists of utility functions: resource path retrieval (`example_stem_path`, `default_metadata`) and a function to get ffmpeg version (`ffmpeg_version`).\n- External command execution (`subprocess.check_output`) is used in a controlled manner with fixed commands.\n- Resource files are accessed via `pkg_resources.resource_filename`, which is standard for Python packages.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident.\n- The code does not process untrusted input directly into sensitive operations or data leaks.\n- No network activity or data exfiltration is present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes resource access and subprocess call.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable, given no malicious intent but acknowledges external command execution.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering external command execution always carries minimal risk if controlled.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; subprocess call is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The minimal risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; subprocess usage is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; resource access and subprocess call are safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; subprocess call is fixed and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to external command execution, which is standard and controlled. A score of **0.1 to 0.2** is appropriate.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (low, due to external command execution, but no actual threat)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard utility module for resource management and external tool version checking. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The current scores are reasonable, but I would suggest:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code while acknowledging the minimal inherent risk of external command execution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Update malware and obfuscated scores to **0**.\n- Keep the risk score at **0.1** for cautious acknowledgment of subprocess usage.\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and legitimacy.",
