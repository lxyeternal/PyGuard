{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python package interface for reading and writing STEM audio files, managing metadata, and checking dependencies like ffmpeg.",
  "sources": "Reads resource files via pkg_resources, executes 'ffmpeg -version' command using subprocess.check_output.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'ffmpeg' command which could potentially be exploited if ffmpeg path is compromised, but no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted by this code.",
  "flows": "Calls 'subprocess.check_output' with a fixed command ['ffmpeg', '-version'], processes output to extract version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. Usage of standard library functions and subprocess with fixed commands. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads resource files from the package, defines utility functions, and retrieves ffmpeg version info by executing an external command. The subprocess call is straightforward and limited to 'ffmpeg -version'. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, nor are there any suspicious or malicious code patterns. The use of pkg_resources to load local data files is standard. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a utility package for handling STEM audio files and metadata. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within the provided code segment.",
