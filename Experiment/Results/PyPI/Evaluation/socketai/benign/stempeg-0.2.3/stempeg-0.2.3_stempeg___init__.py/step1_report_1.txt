{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for reading and writing STEM audio files, managing resources, and retrieving software versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem using pkg_resources.resource_filename, and executes an external command ('ffmpeg -version') via subprocess.check_output.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident that process untrusted input directly into sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function ffmpeg_version() executes an external command ('ffmpeg -version'), captures output, and parses it for version info. No untrusted input flows into these commands; output is processed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Usage of subprocess to run 'ffmpeg' could potentially be manipulated if environment is compromised, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly imports local modules, manages resource paths via pkg_resources, and defines utility functions. The ffmpeg_version() function executes an external process to retrieve ffmpeg version info, which is a common pattern. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or unusual patterns detected. The code appears to be well-structured and typical for a package designed for audio processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for resource management and interfacing with external tools. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior, nor any suspicious data flow. It appears to be a legitimate, safe module for handling STEM audio files with standard external command execution.",
