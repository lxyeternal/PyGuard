  "purpose": "Resource management and version retrieval for external tools (ffmpeg).",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.resource_filename() calls for data files; subprocess.check_output() for 'ffmpeg -version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; subprocess output is parsed locally.",
  "flows": "Resource file paths are retrieved; subprocess runs 'ffmpeg -version' and its output is parsed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward resource access and command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses embedded resource files via pkg_resources and executes a fixed 'ffmpeg -version' command to retrieve version info. No user input influences subprocess calls, reducing injection risk. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The subprocess call is safe due to its static nature. Resource handling is standard and secure. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external command execution, which is controlled and typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard resource management and version checking, and poses no malicious threat. The scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk.",
