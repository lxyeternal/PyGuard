{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python package for reading and writing STEM audio files, including utility functions for accessing sample data and checking external tool versions.",
  "sources": "Data files included in the package via pkg_resources.resource_filename, subprocess output from 'ffmpeg -version'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call captures 'ffmpeg' version info; no data is written or transmitted externally within this code.",
  "flows": "pkg_resources calls provide local file paths; subprocess.check_output captures external command output for version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to call external tools is standard; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, defines utility functions to access package data files, and queries the installed ffmpeg version via subprocess. The subprocess call is safely used with no command injection risks because the command list is static. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The use of pkg_resources to access data files is typical for Python packages. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Python package for handling STEM audio files with utility functions for data access and external tool version checking. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
