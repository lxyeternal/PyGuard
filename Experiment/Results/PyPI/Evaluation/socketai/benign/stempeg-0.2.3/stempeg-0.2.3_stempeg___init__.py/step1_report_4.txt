{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for reading and writing STEM audio files, including utility functions for retrieving file paths and ffmpeg version information.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.resource_filename (used to retrieve embedded resource file paths), subprocess.check_output (used to execute ffmpeg to get version info).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input; subprocess.check_output executes external command but does not handle untrusted data within this code.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves embedded resource paths and executes 'ffmpeg -version' to obtain version info, with data flow limited to process output handling within the application.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard resource access and subprocess invocation without malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily offers utility functions: 'example_stem_path' and 'default_metadata' retrieve embedded resource file paths via pkg_resources; 'ffmpeg_version' runs an external command to get ffmpeg version info. It imports common modules like re, os, subprocess, and pkg_resources, all used in standard ways. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is present. External command execution is controlled and only queries ffmpeg version, a benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It safely accesses embedded resources and queries ffmpeg version without handling untrusted data or performing dangerous operations.",
