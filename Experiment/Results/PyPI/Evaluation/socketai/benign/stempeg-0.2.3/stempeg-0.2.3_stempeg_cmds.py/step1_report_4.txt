{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to locate, verify the existence of, and utilize external multimedia tools (ffmpeg, ffprobe, MP4Box) to check for available AAC encoders and suggest better codecs if possible.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PATH), executes subprocess commands to check tool availability, and reads command output to identify codecs.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands that execute with paths and arguments derived from internal variables, with no direct use of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "find_cmd function locates executables; ffmpeg_and_ffprobe_exists and mp4box_exists cache their paths; check_available_aac_encoders runs ffmpeg with specific arguments; get_aac_codec processes the command output to determine available codecs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of subprocess.check_output is standard but should be noted that command execution depends on the presence of external tools, not user input. No obfuscation or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies the existence of necessary multimedia tools by searching system PATH, raises an error if not found, and provides functions to check available AAC encoders. It executes external commands safely within the context of a known environment. No malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and intended for environment validation and feature detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and designed for system environment validation related to multimedia processing. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present; it mainly interacts with external tools to check capabilities.",
