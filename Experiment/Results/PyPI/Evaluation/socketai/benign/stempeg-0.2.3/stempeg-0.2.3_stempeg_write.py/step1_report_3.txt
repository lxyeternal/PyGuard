  "purpose": "This code provides various classes and functions to save audio stems to disk in different formats and configurations, including multi-file, multi-channel, multi-stream, and native instruments formats. It is designed for use within a larger audio processing pipeline to output audio data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from numpy arrays (stems tensor), and from file paths provided as strings or tuples. It also reads metadata from JSON files or dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "The code writes audio data to disk using ffmpeg subprocess calls, temporary files, and metadata embedding via mp4box. It also writes binary audio data directly to ffmpeg's stdin.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy arrays (stems tensor) into various writer classes, which process and output audio files or streams via ffmpeg subprocesses or temporary files, with metadata embedded when necessary.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive use of subprocess calls for media conversion without explicit validation of external command inputs. It uses temporary files for intermediate processing. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets are evident. No hidden or obfuscated code patterns are observed. Metadata handling involves base64 encoding, but this is standard for embedding JSON into media containers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive module for writing audio stems in multiple formats, with clear separation of concerns and extensive use of ffmpeg for media processing. It manages temporary files and subprocesses carefully, with exception handling and resource cleanup. There are no indications of malicious intent such as system data exfiltration, backdoors, or stealthy malicious code. All subprocess calls appear to invoke standard ffmpeg and mp4box commands for audio processing and packaging. Metadata embedding via base64 is a common technique and does not raise suspicion. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system tampering. It is primarily concerned with media processing, and no insecure practices such as unsafe SQL, code injection, or environment variable misuse are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured module for saving audio stems in various formats. It uses standard media processing tools and techniques. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this review. It appears to be intended solely for audio file creation and metadata embedding, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
