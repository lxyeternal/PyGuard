  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'stempeg' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from file reads and package metadata to setup configuration; no dynamic or external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script utilizing 'setuptools'. It reads a README file, defines package info, dependencies, and CLI commands. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present. All dependencies are common, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The code is static and benign, with no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard packaging configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which are justified.",
