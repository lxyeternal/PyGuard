{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the stempeg Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies defined directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration with no dynamic data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py conventions followed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads a README file for description, and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All operations are static and intended for packaging. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The package dependencies are common for audio processing tasks. No sensitive data handling or external code execution is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely defines package configuration and dependencies for distribution.",
