{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'stempeg' Python package, used for reading and writing stem/multistream audio files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; obtaining package metadata; reading dependencies and entry points; accessing package URLs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows directly into dangerous actions or system commands.",
  "flows": "The script flows from data sources (e.g., 'README.md', dependencies, URLs) into package setup configuration; no data flows into malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present. All dependencies are standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for description, configures package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and URLs. No user input is processed, and no code execution occurs beyond static configuration. All elements are typical for a Python package setup script. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, supply chain threats, or security risks evident.",
