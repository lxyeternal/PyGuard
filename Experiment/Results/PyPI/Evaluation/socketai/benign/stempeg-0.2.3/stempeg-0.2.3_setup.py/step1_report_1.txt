{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the stempeg Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, retrieves package metadata, dependencies, and entry points from the setup() arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or environment variable operations beyond standard setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Input from README.md -> used in long_description; package metadata and dependencies are defined and used by setup tools; entry points define console scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements present. Use of standard setup and packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No untrusted input handling or external network operations are performed. All elements are typical for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe and intended solely for packaging distribution.",
