  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'stempeg' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; package metadata fields; dependencies specified in install_requires and extras_require; entry_points for CLI script.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly detected; no untrusted data sinks like network connections, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) to assign long_description (sink); dependencies and entry points are static configuration, no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code. The code is a standard setup script with typical package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for setup; reads the README for description; configures package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points; uses static data for setup parameters; no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present; follows common pattern for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and CLI commands in a typical manner.",
