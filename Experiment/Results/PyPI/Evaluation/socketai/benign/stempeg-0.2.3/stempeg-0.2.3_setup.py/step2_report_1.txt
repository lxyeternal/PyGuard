  "review": "Let's analyze the provided setup script and the associated reports carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` using `setuptools`.\n- Reads `README.md` for `long_description`.\n- Defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and URLs.\n- Uses static, well-known libraries (`setuptools`, `codecs`, `os`) without any dynamic or obfuscated code.\n- No network operations, file manipulations beyond reading the README, or environment variable handling.\n- No user input or external data sources other than the static README file.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present. The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No code execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n\n### Review of the reports:\n- All five reports consistently describe the script as a standard, benign setup configuration.\n- They note the absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external data flows.\n- The analysis in each report aligns with the actual code content.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or malicious elements, the scores are justified.\n- The confidence level is 1, reflecting certainty based on the static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would agree with the existing scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the thorough analysis provided.",
