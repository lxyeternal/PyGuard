{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for processing and converting stem audio files, reading metadata and saving output files.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename, stem IDs, start offset, duration, and output directory from command-line arguments. Reads stem files using Info and read_stems functions.",
  "sinks": "Writes output files via write_stems and FilesWriter. No untrusted data flows into system commands or sensitive system functions.",
  "flows": "Input filename and parameters are processed, then stem data is read and written to specified output directory with optional filename modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual code constructs. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for audio stem processing, utilizing standard libraries and functions. It handles file paths, directories, and metadata without executing any external or untrusted code. No malicious patterns such as code injection, network activity, or system compromise are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for audio processing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard Python libraries and custom modules for reading and writing files. There are no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
