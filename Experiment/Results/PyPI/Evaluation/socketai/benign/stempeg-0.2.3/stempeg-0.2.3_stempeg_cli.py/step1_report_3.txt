{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for processing stem audio files, reading input files, and saving processed stems to an output directory.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename, optional stem IDs, start offset, read duration, and output directory from command-line arguments; accesses the filesystem for directory existence and creation.",
  "sinks": "Uses input filename and output directory for file operations; writes stem files using write_stems and FilesWriter, which may involve file system writes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from command-line args to the stem2files function, which reads the stem file, processes it, and writes output to specified directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain/network activity, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments, reads stem data from specified files, manages output directories, and writes processed stem files. Uses standard libraries (argparse, os, os.path) and well-defined functions. No suspicious code flows, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. File and directory operations are normal; no user data is transmitted externally. The code's intent appears to be legitimate processing of audio stem files without any hidden or malicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for audio file processing. No malicious behavior or malware is detected. It performs expected file handling and processing tasks securely, with no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
