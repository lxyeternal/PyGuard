{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for processing STEM audio files, extracting stems, and saving them with specified options.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the filename argument (stems_file), environment variables are not directly used, and file system checks/read/write occur for output directories and files.",
  "sinks": "The code writes stem files to disk using write_stems and FilesWriter. No untrusted data flows into network or system commands. No credential or secret handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> read Info and stems -> determine output path and filenames -> write stem files to disk",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious logic. The code performs standard file I/O operations, directory creation, and data processing. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI for processing audio stems, parsing arguments safely, and performing file system operations to read input files and save output stems. The only potential concern is directory creation, but it is handled explicitly and safely. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates no malicious intent. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for stem audio processing without malicious or suspicious behavior. It operates securely, with no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
