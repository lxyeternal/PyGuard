  "purpose": "A CLI utility for processing and converting stem audio files, reading metadata, and writing output files with specified parameters.",
  "sources": "Input filename, stem IDs, start offset, duration, output directory, and extension parameters",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as directory creation and file writing",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> read info and stems -> create directories if needed -> write stems to output files",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity; directory creation is handled explicitly and safely",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward CLI for audio stem processing, utilizing standard libraries and safe file operations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Directory creation is conditioned on user input and handled securely. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code's operations are typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for processing stem audio files with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
