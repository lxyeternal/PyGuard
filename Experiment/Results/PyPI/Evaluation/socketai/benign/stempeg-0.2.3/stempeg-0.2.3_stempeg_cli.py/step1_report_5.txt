{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface to read and process stem audio files, then write the processed stems to an output directory with specified parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths from command-line arguments; reads stem files via Info and read_stems functions; accesses environment and filesystem through os.path and os.makedirs.",
  "sinks": "Uses the write_stems function to output files; potential for file creation/modification in specified directories.",
  "flows": "User inputs file path -> Info and read_stems functions process the file -> write_stems outputs processed files to specified directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; all file operations are standard; no evident data leaks or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a CLI for processing audio stem files, handling arguments for input/output paths, extensions, stem IDs, start/duration offsets, and output directory creation. It reads metadata and stem data, manages output directory creation if needed, and writes processed stems. No network activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Functions used are typical for file processing, and no malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard command-line utility for audio processing without malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior, and no security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
