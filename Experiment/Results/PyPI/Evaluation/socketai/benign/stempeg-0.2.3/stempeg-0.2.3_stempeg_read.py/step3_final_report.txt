{
  "purpose": "The code loads audio stems from files into numpy arrays, supporting multi-stream and multi-channel configurations, using ffmpeg for decoding and numpy for processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename, ffmpeg subprocess outputs, and optional metadata info.",
  "sinks": "Outputs numpy arrays containing audio data, potentially normalized, from ffmpeg buffers.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> ffmpeg decoding process -> buffer -> numpy buffer -> array -> normalization and reshaping -> output array.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of multiprocessing is standard and properly managed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard audio decoding using ffmpeg, converting buffers into numpy arrays with normalization. It handles multi-stream and multi-channel audio, with error handling and multiprocessing for efficiency. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, and the code uses well-known libraries appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for loading audio stems. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe for supply chain use.",
