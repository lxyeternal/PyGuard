{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to load audio stems into numpy tensors from various media files, supporting multi-stream and multi-channel configurations, primarily using ffmpeg for decoding.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename, start time, duration, stem ID, and optional info object; uses ffmpeg.probe and ffmpeg.input to gather metadata and decode audio streams.",
  "sinks": "Uses ffmpeg subprocesses to decode audio data; outputs numpy arrays; does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input filename → ffmpeg.probe and ffmpeg.input → subprocess communication → numpy buffer conversion → optional data normalization and reshaping.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard audio decoding and processing tasks. Uses multiprocessing pool for parallel decoding, which is normal for performance optimization.",
  "analysis": "The script performs audio stream probing and decoding via ffmpeg, with functions to handle multi-stream and multi-channel audio data. It normalizes integer PCM data to float, and reshapes data for multi-channel support. The use of ffmpeg subprocesses, numpy for buffer handling, and optional multiprocessing are typical in audio processing tools. No anomalies such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, with proper exception handling for ffmpeg errors. The logic adheres to expected audio processing workflows without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard audio processing utility for loading stems into numpy arrays. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It performs expected functions within audio data handling with appropriate safeguards. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
