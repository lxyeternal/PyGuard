{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load audio stems from files into numpy tensors, supporting multi-stream and multi-channel audio formats for processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Input filenames for audio files, environment variables indirectly through ffmpeg (potentially), and optional info object passed to avoid reloading metadata.",
  "sinks": "The code processes audio data using ffmpeg and numpy, outputs audio arrays, and does not write or transmit data externally; no direct sinks for untrusted data are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> ffmpeg probe and decoding -> numpy buffer reading and normalization -> output as numpy array; optional multiprocessing for reading streams in parallel.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious privacy violations detected. Use of ffmpeg for decoding audio is standard; no suspicious commands or obfuscated code found. No unusual code behaviors or misleading variable names. No code injection or unsafe eval calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for reading audio stems from files using ffmpeg, converting to numpy arrays, with optional multiprocessing. It uses standard libraries and practices. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The only external process invocation is ffmpeg, which is a legitimate multimedia tool, and the data flow is confined within the functions, with no external data transmissions or secretive operations. The code properly handles errors, normalizes data, and provides metadata access. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate audio processing utility with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a sound data loader, with standard use of ffmpeg and numpy, and does not exhibit malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
