{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load audio stems into numpy tensors from media files, supporting multi-stream and multi-channel audio processing using ffmpeg.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from audio files specified by filename, using ffmpeg.probe to retrieve metadata, and ffmpeg's input and output streams to load audio buffers.",
  "sinks": "The code processes audio buffers into numpy arrays; it does not directly write data to external systems or network locations.",
  "flows": "Sources (filename, ffmpeg processing) feed data into _read_ffmpeg, which outputs numpy arrays; read_stems manages multiple calls and aggregates results into tensors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed. External libraries used (ffmpeg, numpy) are standard for media processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles media metadata extraction, multi-channel audio processing, and reading audio data into numpy arrays. It uses ffmpeg for decoding, with support for multi-threaded processing. No code injection, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The process of loading media data appears straightforward and transparent. The use of external libraries is typical, and no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution was identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of audio data processing without malicious intent. No malware or malicious behavior detected. The security risk is minimal, mostly related to standard media processing operations. The code is clear and well-structured, with no signs of sabotage.",
