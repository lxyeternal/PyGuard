  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide imported symbols, but this is a style issue rather than a security threat. The overall security risk is very low, contingent on the content of the 'owncloud' module, which is not provided. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate."
