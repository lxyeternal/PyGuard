  "purpose": "Import all components from the 'owncloud' module, likely for file synchronization or cloud storage interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .owncloud module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified within this snippet; potential vulnerabilities depend on how the imported module is used.",
  "flows": "Importing all symbols from the local 'owncloud' module, which may contain various functionalities.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code provided; the use of 'import *' can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious functions if present, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a relative module. There are no signs of obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The code snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior; its security implications depend on the contents of the 'owncloud' module. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged as it can mask imported components, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's security implications depend on the content of the 'owncloud' module it imports. No anomalies or malware signals are apparent.",
