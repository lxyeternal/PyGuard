  "sinks": "None evident; no data processing or external output in this snippet",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is present in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') from a local module, which can obscure what is being imported and may lead to unpredictable behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module named 'owncloud'. There are no input sources, data processing, or network communication. The use of wildcard import could be considered bad practice but does not in itself indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code merely imports a module locally without any suspicious or malicious operations. The use of '*' import is a potential code quality concern but not a security threat. Overall, no malicious activity is indicated.",
