  "sources": "Environment variables, standard library modules, network requests, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file operations, environment variables, system calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, input) to sinks (network, file, system), with no suspicious data exfiltration or backdoors identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, obfuscated scores to 0, and security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9), justified by the summaries. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. Given the limited context, the assessments are reasonable and conservative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 could be considered to reflect very low likelihood of malicious intent, but 0.2 remains acceptable.",
