{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'pyocclient' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.rst', 'CONTRIBUTORS.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; setup process primarily reads local files and specifies dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading local files to generate long_description, then passing static metadata to 'setup' function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns observed. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'io', reads documentation files for the package description, and calls 'setup' with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic or untrusted data handling, no network operations, no code execution beyond package configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions solely to configure the package metadata and dependencies.",
