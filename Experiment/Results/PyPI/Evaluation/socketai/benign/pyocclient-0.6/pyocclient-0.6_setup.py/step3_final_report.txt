{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'pyocclient' Python package, used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and documentation for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads static documentation files ('README.rst', 'CONTRIBUTORS.rst', 'CHANGES.rst') from local filesystem; no external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, data transmission, or code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads static files into long_description variable, then passes configuration to setuptools.setup() without further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; all operations are static and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads static documentation files with specified encodings, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, and calls setup() to prepare the package. There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. All signals point to a benign, well-structured package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature.",
