  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'pyocclient' that prepares the package for distribution, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst, CONTRIBUTORS.rst, and CHANGES.rst files for long description; hardcoded strings for package info and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected. No data is sent or executed based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading documentation files to assemble long description; no untrusted data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup script with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. No suspicious code patterns or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code loads static documentation files to compose the package's long description, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. All operations are typical of a package setup script. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No user input is read, and no network or system commands are executed. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions solely to prepare the package for distribution.",
