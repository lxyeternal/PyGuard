{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyocclient', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst', 'CONTRIBUTORS.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long description; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup' function to process package installation parameters; no untrusted data handling or insecure operations observed.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for descriptive content, then passes static metadata to 'setup' without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of standard libraries and typical setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'io', reads static documentation files for the long description, and calls 'setup' with package metadata and dependencies. There are no input sanitization issues, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or external data fetching beyond static file reading. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution, presenting no security threats.",
