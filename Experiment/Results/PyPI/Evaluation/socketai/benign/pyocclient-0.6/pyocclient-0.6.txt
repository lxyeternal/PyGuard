      "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature."

The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide imported symbols, but this is a style issue rather than a security threat. The overall security risk is very low, contingent on the content of the 'owncloud' module, which is not provided. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 could be considered to reflect very low likelihood of malicious intent, but 0.2 remains acceptable."
