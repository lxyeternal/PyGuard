  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging, with no malicious activity or suspicious code. The dynamic import of optional commands is typical, and no anomalies are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code as a typical setup script with optional build commands. The only noted anomaly is a \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1, which is slightly above zero, but the reasoning indicates it's due to the optional import pattern, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Given the reasoning, this is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments, no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The code is standard setup logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard setup script, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), but this is justified by the use of optional imports, which is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package, involving dependency management, optional build commands, and reading files for metadata.\n- No suspicious network activity, code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The dynamic import pattern is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The only minor concern (risk score 0.1) is justified by the optional import handling, which is a common and safe practice.\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (consistent with the cautious but justified assessment in the reports)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The slight risk score reflects the minor uncertainty about optional imports, but overall, it poses no security threat.",
