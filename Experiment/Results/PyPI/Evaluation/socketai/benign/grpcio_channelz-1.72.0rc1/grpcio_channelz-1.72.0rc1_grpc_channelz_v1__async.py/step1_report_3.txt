  "purpose": "Implementing an asynchronous gRPC servicer for channel management, forwarding requests to a synchronous handler.",
  "sources": "Imports, method parameters (request, context), method calls to _SyncChannelzServicer",
  "sinks": "Calls to _SyncChannelzServicer methods, return statements",
  "flows": "Request parameters -> calls to _SyncChannelzServicer methods -> responses returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or dynamic execution. Use of static method wrappers is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async gRPC servicer class that forwards each RPC call to a corresponding synchronous handler. It imports necessary modules, defines static async methods, and returns results from the sync class. No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present. The code acts as a thin async wrapper around existing sync handlers without introducing additional logic or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward async wrapper for existing synchronous channelz gRPC handlers, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply delegates calls and does not handle sensitive data directly.",
