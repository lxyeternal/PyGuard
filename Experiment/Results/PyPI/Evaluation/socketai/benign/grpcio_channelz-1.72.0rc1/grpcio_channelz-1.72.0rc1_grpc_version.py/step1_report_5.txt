  "purpose": "Defines the version of the gRPC Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code sets a constant string variable 'VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are observed. The code is auto-generated and contains licensing information only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a single version assignment. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a fragment of a larger auto-generated file. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical metadata code found in Python packages.",
