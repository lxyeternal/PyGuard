  "purpose": "Defines supported Python versions and minimum/maximum versions for a gRPC-related package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version lists and constants at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data sources and sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is simple, auto-generated, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets constants for supported Python versions and licensing information. It is auto-generated, contains no user input, external data processing, or suspicious constructs. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The simplicity and licensing comments suggest a standard, benign configuration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to specify supported Python versions for a gRPC component and includes licensing information, with no indication of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
