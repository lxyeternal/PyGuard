  "purpose": "Define supported Python versions and version bounds for a gRPC component, serving as static configuration metadata.",
  "sources": "Static list of supported Python versions and version bounds; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely declarative with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration listing supported Python versions with no dynamic logic, input handling, or external dependencies. It contains only variable assignments and comments, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, auto-generated, and free of security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, serving as metadata, and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration snippet specifying supported Python versions. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
