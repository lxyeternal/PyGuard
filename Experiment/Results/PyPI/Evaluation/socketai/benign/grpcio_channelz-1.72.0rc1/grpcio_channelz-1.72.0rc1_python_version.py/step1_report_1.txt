{
  "purpose": "Defines supported Python versions and version range for a gRPC-related package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns static lists and values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static configuration listing supported Python versions and version bounds. It is auto-generated and contains no dynamic or executable logic that could be malicious. It does not access external data, handle user input, or perform any operations beyond static assignments. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a safe, standard part of a larger package, possibly auto-generated documentation or configuration.",
