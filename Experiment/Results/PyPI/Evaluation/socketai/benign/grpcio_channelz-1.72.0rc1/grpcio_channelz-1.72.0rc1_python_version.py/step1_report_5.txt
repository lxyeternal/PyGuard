  "purpose": "Define supported Python versions and minimum/maximum version constraints for a gRPC-related project.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static configuration data defined in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for version support configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration file with hardcoded supported Python versions and version bounds. It contains licensing comments and a generated code note. No untrusted input, no external data processing, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present. The code is safe, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet specifying supported Python versions for a gRPC project. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors identified.",
