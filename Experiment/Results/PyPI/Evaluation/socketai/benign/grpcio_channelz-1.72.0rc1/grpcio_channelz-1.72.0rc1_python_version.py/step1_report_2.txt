  "purpose": "Defines supported Python versions and version range for a gRPC-related module.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS, MIN_PYTHON_VERSION, and MAX_PYTHON_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; static data assignment without external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and auto-generated with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets constants for supported Python versions, with no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external dependencies or data. It appears to be a configuration snippet, likely auto-generated, without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration defining supported Python versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
