  "purpose": "Implementation of gRPC Channelz debug service to retrieve channel, server, socket, and subchannel information for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "cygrpc.channelz_get_* functions, which fetch data from underlying gRPC channel components.",
  "sinks": "json_format.Parse processes data fetched from cygrpc functions, converting JSON strings into protobuf response objects.",
  "flows": "cygrpc.channelz_get_* functions (source) provide data that flows into json_format.Parse (sink) to generate responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code primarily handles data parsing and exception management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward implementation of a gRPC service with multiple methods retrieving channel, server, socket, and subchannel data via cygrpc calls. Exception handling appropriately sets gRPC status codes based on error types. No input from untrusted sources is evident; the data fetching relies on internal cygrpc functions. The parsing of data from cygrpc appears controlled and is limited to internal function calls, with no user input or external data injection points. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage signs are present. The code’s structure and function calls do not exhibit obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard gRPC service implementation for debugging, with no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and consistent with legitimate debugging tools.",
