  "purpose": "Implementation of a gRPC debug service exposing internal channel, server, socket, and subchannel data via internal cygrpc functions.",
  "sources": "cygrpc.channelz_get_top_channels, cygrpc.channelz_get_servers, cygrpc.channelz_get_server, cygrpc.channelz_get_server_sockets, cygrpc.channelz_get_channel, cygrpc.channelz_get_subchannel, cygrpc.channelz_get_socket",
  "sinks": "json_format.Parse functions converting cygrpc JSON responses into protobuf response objects",
  "flows": "cygrpc internal functions (sources) -> json_format.Parse (sink) -> gRPC response objects",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard exception handling and no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code implements a debug gRPC service that retrieves internal channel and server data through internal cygrpc functions, parsing JSON responses into protobuf objects. Exception handling correctly sets gRPC status codes based on error types. No external input influences the data, and no obfuscation or malicious code is present. The purpose is for debugging/monitoring, and the data exposed could contain sensitive internal info, but this aligns with the service's intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of an internal debugging gRPC service. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage are present. The minor security risk score reflects the exposure of internal debug data but is appropriate given the context.",
