  "purpose": "Registering the gRPC Channelz debug service for introspection and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, version-dependent conditional import, and service registration functions.",
  "sinks": "Service registration functions (_channelz_pb2_grpc.add_ChannelzServicer_to_server).",
  "flows": "Conditional import based on Python version, then registration of ChannelzServicer or aio.ChannelzServicer to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for adding a debugging service to a gRPC server, with version-aware conditional imports. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations beyond registration, or contain obfuscation. The minor risk scores in some reports likely reflect environment exposure but are not indicative of actual security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe for use in controlled environments. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
