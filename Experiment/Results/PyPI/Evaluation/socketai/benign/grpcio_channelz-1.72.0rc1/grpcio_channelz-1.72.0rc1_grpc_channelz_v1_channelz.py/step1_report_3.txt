  "purpose": "Implement the Channelz debug service in gRPC Python for server introspection and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "sys module, grpc, grpc_channelz.v1._servicer, grpc_channelz.v1.channelz_pb2_grpc, optional aio module for async support.",
  "sinks": "add_ChannelzServicer_to_server function, which adds the ChannelzServicer to a gRPC server instance.",
  "flows": "Import sys to determine Python version -> conditional import of async module -> call to add_ChannelzServicer_to_server with appropriate servicer based on server type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code is straightforward and mainly for service registration. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility to add a ChannelzServicer to a gRPC server, with support for asynchronous servers if Python version is >= 3.6. It relies on standard gRPC libraries and does not include any network communications, data leakage, or system manipulation. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code performs a standard setup task in a safe manner, following typical patterns for gRPC service registration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for registering a monitoring/diagnostics service in gRPC, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses legitimate libraries and straightforward logic. No malicious intent detected.",
