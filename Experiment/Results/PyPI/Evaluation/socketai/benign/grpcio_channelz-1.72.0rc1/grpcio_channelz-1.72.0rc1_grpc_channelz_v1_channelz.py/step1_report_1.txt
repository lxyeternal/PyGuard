  "purpose": "Implement and add the Channelz debug service to a gRPC server for inspecting channel statistics.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, grpc, and grpc_channelz modules; usage of class ChannelzServicer and add_ChannelzServicer_to_server function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly invoke untrusted data sinks or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are processed into sinks. The code mainly registers service handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is primarily setup and registration logic for a service.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to add the ChannelzServicer to a gRPC server depending on the Python version, and documents the function. It utilizes standard gRPC service registration without any dynamic code execution or external data processing. The code is straightforward, using established APIs for server setup. No anomalies, suspicious logic, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard implementation for adding a debugging service to a gRPC server. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves its purpose without any suspicious activities.",
