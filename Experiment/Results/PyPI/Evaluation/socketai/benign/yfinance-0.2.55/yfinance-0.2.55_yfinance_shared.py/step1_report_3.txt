  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a market data downloader library called yfinance, intended for retrieving financial data.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources in this fragment; the code primarily defines global variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could leak information are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this snippet; it's mainly variable initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. The code contains only variable definitions and licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is the initial part of a Python script with licensing and copyright information, followed by the declaration of several global variables initialized as empty dictionaries or None. There is no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions in this fragment. The variables appear to be placeholders for managing download progress, errors, traceback info, and ISINs. No suspicious or malicious activity is indicated.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign header and variable initialization section of the yfinance library. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment.",
