  "purpose": "Variable initialization for internal state management in the yfinance library.",
  "sources": "No external input; static variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward variable setup with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only variable declarations with no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code. It is standard boilerplate for setting up internal state variables. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The variables are initialized as empty dictionaries or None, typical for internal use. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, part of an open-source data library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
