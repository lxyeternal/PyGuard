  "purpose": "Market data downloader for yfinance library, used to fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance.",
  "sources": "No input sources in the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only variable initializations with no active code, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable declarations initializing empty dictionaries or None. It appears to set up internal state variables for a larger module. There are no functions, no data processing, no network activity, and no use of dangerous functions or operations. Given the context and the code snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple initialization segment of the yfinance library, containing no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard boilerplate code for setting up internal variables.",
