  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the presence of issues, the reasonableness of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard utility functions for financial data, no unusual data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows or sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low risk, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The malware score of 0 is justified, and the security risk is minimal. The detailed functions are typical for such libraries.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for data handling, with data coming from API responses, user input, and regex validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution of system commands or code injection; data flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns. Regex and data parsing are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent detected, very low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and consistent. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The functions are for data validation and formatting, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for data processing, with no external code execution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network commands or code injections; standard data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or secrets; standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, benign code.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion matches the code's intent. Malware score of 0 is justified, with low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for data parsing and formatting, with data from API responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; requests module is used for data retrieval, which is expected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or backdoors; standard data handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is typical for data handling in such libraries. Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, with `get_all_by_isin` involving a local `Search` class that likely performs network requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The network request via `Search` is legitimate for data retrieval.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The data flow is standard for fetching data.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity; network interactions are expected.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The malware score of 0 is justified; the data retrieval is part of normal operation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. No obfuscation is present.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No malicious patterns, code injections, or backdoors are detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Low across all, justified by the benign analysis.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nBased on the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** approximately 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a collection of utility functions for data parsing, formatting, and logging within the yfinance ecosystem. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation present.",
