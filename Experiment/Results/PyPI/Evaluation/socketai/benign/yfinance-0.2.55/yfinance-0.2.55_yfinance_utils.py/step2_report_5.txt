  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for financial data, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2, confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is benign, with standard practices. The security risk score of 0.2 might be slightly conservative; since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected, a score closer to 0.1 or 0.0 would be more appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. Malware score should remain at 0. Confidence is high, so no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes utility functions for data handling, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, confidence is 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code appears benign. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is appropriately low.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions for data processing, with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1, confidence is 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The security risk could be slightly lowered, but 0.1 is acceptable given the complexity and external dependencies.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. Malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data handling, with external requests via the requests library, but no malicious activity. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1, confidence is 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The presence of requests for data retrieval is standard. No suspicious code or backdoors are detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. Malware score is justified at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, functions for data parsing and formatting, with network requests via a local Search class, which is legitimate. No malicious activity. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1, confidence is 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The use of a local Search class for data retrieval is standard for such libraries. No signs of malicious code.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. Malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. The code is standard utility functions for data processing, logging, and formatting, typical for a financial data library.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code segments are identified.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** The scores are consistent with the analysis; no reason to increase them.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code employs standard validation, data handling, and logging practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of **0.1** or **0.2** is acceptable; no need to increase.\n\n- **Confidence:** High confidence that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**Estimated scores for the overall code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (to reflect minimal inherent risk but no malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of supply chain attack or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and should not be adjusted upward.",
