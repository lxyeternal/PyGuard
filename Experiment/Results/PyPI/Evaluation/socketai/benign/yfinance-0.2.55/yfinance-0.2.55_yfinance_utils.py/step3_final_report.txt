  "purpose": "Utility functions for financial data parsing, formatting, validation, logging, and data retrieval within the yfinance ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Data from JSON responses, regex validation, user input, external API calls via requests and local Search class.",
  "sinks": "DataFrames, network requests, regex-based validation, data merging; no system commands or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input data from API responses or user input flows through parsing, validation, and formatting functions; network requests via get_all_by_isin to retrieve data.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code; use of local Search class for network data retrieval is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for data handling, validation, logging, and formatting. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The network interactions are legitimate for data retrieval. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for financial data processing with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
