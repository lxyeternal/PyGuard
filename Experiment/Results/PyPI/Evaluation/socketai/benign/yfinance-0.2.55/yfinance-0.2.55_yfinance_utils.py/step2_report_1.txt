  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the reasoning behind the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for financial data processing with extensive functions for parsing, formatting, logging, and data validation. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is standard utility functions with no malicious intent. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The securityRisk is slightly above zero, likely due to external request handling and data parsing, but nothing suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data handling, validation, and formatting. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The code is benign and designed for data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity is evident, and the detailed validation and parsing functions are standard. The zero security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data handling, formatting, and logging. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. The slight increase in securityRisk (0.1) could be due to the use of requests and data merging, but nothing malicious is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions supporting data retrieval and processing. No indicators of malicious behavior. The code is secure and well-structured.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The functions are typical for a data utility library, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data parsing and formatting, with external network requests via get_all_by_isin. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes that get_all_by_isin involves network activity, but this is legitimate for data retrieval. No malicious intent is implied.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign malware=0, which is justified. The code is primarily data handling, formatting, and validation functions, with no malicious payloads or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** The scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the use of requests and data processing functions, which are standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Request handling:** While the code interacts with external data sources (Yahoo Finance API), this is expected and legitimate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal risk due to data handling and external requests, but nothing suspicious.\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The code's complexity and extensive validation are typical for a financial data library.\n- The use of requests and data merging functions are standard and do not indicate malicious activity.\n- No signs of supply chain attack or malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security posture of this code is very low risk. It is a legitimate utility module for financial data processing with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
