  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code presence, logic, potential malicious activity, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The purpose is to download Yahoo Finance data; sources are user inputs and internal data fetches.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data leaks; data flows from user input through standard network requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious control flow. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate data downloader, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard open-source data downloader. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware score aligns with this. The security risk is minimal, mostly related to network requests, which is typical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on input validation and network requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into shared structures; no data exfiltration or malicious network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; threading and error handling are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe data retrieval code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1. No malicious behavior detected. The use of threading and network calls is standard for such tools.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed input handling including ISINs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data stored in shared variables; no malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Use of threading and exception handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** A legitimate Yahoo Finance data downloader.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The code’s structure and purpose are consistent with a typical open-source data retrieval tool.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Download data with options for proxies, sessions, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into shared structures; no data leaks or exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; handling of network parameters is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** A legitimate data downloader.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity or backdoors. The code’s behavior aligns with standard data scraping tools.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, with focus on input parameters and data fetching.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data stored internally; no malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Use of threading and error handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** A legitimate Yahoo Finance data downloader.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm the code is present and functional.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.2), mostly due to network requests and handling of user inputs, which is typical for data scraping tools.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9+), given the consistent findings across multiple reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minimal, typical for network-based data retrieval tools; no active vulnerabilities or malicious activities identified.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a standard, open-source Yahoo Finance data downloader with no signs of malicious intent or security risks beyond normal network operations. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
