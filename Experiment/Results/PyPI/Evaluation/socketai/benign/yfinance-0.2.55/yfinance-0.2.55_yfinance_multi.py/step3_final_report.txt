{
  "purpose": "The code is a multi-threaded Yahoo Finance data downloader that fetches historical market data for specified tickers, handling user inputs, ISINs, date ranges, proxies, and sessions, and storing the data in shared structures for concatenation and return.",
  "sources": "User inputs (tickers, ISINs, date parameters, proxies, sessions), network requests via Ticker.history()",
  "sinks": "Shared global dictionaries (_DFS, _ERRORS, _TRACEBACKS), concatenated DataFrame output, logs",
  "flows": "Input parameters → Ticker.history() calls → shared dictionaries → concatenation into final DataFrame",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious control flow detected; use of shared globals in multi-threaded context is standard but could pose risks if misused",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data retrieval from Yahoo Finance, with threading, error handling, and input processing. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Network activity is typical for data scraping. Error handling captures exceptions without executing malicious actions. The shared global variables are used for multi-threaded data collection, which is common. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, which is a legitimate open-source data downloader.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented Yahoo Finance data downloader with no signs of malicious or sabotage activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
