  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Yahoo Finance API client implementation. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified by the complexity of cookie and token management but does not indicate vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe for use, and the reports' assessments are accurate."
