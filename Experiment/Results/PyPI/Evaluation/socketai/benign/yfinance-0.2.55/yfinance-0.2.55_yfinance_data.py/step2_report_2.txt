  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages Yahoo API sessions, cookies, and caching.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, uses standard cookie/token handling, no obfuscation or malicious network activity. Random User-Agent is typical for evasion.\n- **Conclusion:** Appears legitimate, no malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behavior. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with focus on session, cookies, and proxies.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard request flow. Random User-Agent is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard API client behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1, no malicious behavior. The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Singleton class for Yahoo data, cookie and crumb management.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation, standard practices, random User-Agent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, with proper session handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; no suspicious activity. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar session, cookie, and request management.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard techniques. Random User-Agent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate data retrieval code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected; scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages Yahoo data, cookies, and requests.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Uses random User-Agent, no secrets, no obfuscation, standard flow.\n- **Conclusion:** Appears to be a typical web scraping/API client.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and reasoning confirms no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently low at 0.2, justified by the standard, legitimate code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: My Own Estimation\n\nGiven the detailed reasoning and consistent findings across all reports, I concur with the assessments:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, due to standard session and cookie handling, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The use of random User-Agent headers is common for evasion and not malicious.\n- The code handles cookies, tokens, and requests in a standard manner.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The request flow and caching mechanisms are typical for such API clients.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall security assessment aligns with the provided reports. The scores are appropriate, and I see no reason to adjust them.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.2**  \n\nThis code appears safe, legitimate, and free from malicious intent or obfuscation.",
