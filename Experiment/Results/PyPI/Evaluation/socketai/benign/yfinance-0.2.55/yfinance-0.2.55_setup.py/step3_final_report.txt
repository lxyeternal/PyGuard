{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'yfinance' Python library, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'yfinance/version.py' and long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static reads of version and description files; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The print statement at the end is benign; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with straightforward static file reads and a call to setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. All dependencies are standard, and the print statement is harmless. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. It is safe for use and distribution.",
