{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'yfinance' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from 'yfinance/version.py'; reading 'README.md' for long description; package configuration data within 'setup()' call.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations beyond standard setup configurations.",
  "flows": "Reading version info and long description from files, then passing data to 'setup()' for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The version is dynamically read from a file, which is standard practice. No suspicious network connections, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata and setup configuration using standard Python packaging practices. It reads version information from an internal file and loads a README for description, then invokes 'setup()' to prepare the package. The dependencies listed are typical for a financial data package. There are no code injection points, no network operations, and no code that manipulates or leaks data maliciously. The print statement at the end is harmless and only provides a disclaimer message. Overall, this code appears to be legitimate setup code for the 'yfinance' package with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs typical package metadata collection and setup tasks without any suspicious operations.",
