  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms that the code is a standard setup script, reading version info and description, with no suspicious code, network activity, or data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (since no risk is indicated, but the script performs package setup, which is inherently low risk).\n- **Justification:** The code is purely declarative and standard; no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the absence of suspicious code, network activity, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** The script is a typical setup.py with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the standard nature of the setup script, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: a standard setup script, no untrusted data, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** No risks identified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; straightforward package setup code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for packaging and distribution.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (a standard setup script), the risk is minimal. Even if one considers the potential for supply chain issues, this script itself doesn't introduce any vulnerabilities or malicious payloads.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — standard package setup, no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package. It reads version info and description from static files and invokes `setup()` with package metadata. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or specific checks are needed.",
