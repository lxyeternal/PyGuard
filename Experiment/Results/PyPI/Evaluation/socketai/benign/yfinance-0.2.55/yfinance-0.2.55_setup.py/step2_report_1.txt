  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for the 'yfinance' package.\n- The code reads version info from a static file, loads a README, and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are observed.\n- The print statement at the end is benign, serving as a disclaimer.\n\n**Malware score:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- Given the code's purpose and content, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and readable.\n\n**Risk score:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified because the script is a standard package setup with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Logical errors or reasoning flaws:**\n\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reports. The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n**Score justification:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and content.\n- The reasoning correctly identifies that this is a benign, standard setup script.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n\n- No changes needed; the analysis is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The reports are consistent and justified in their scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or hidden behaviors, but based on this static analysis, the package appears safe.",
