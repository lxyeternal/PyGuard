  "purpose": "Setup script for the yfinance Python package, used to download market data from Yahoo! Finance.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from yfinance/version.py, reads long description from README.md, and package dependencies from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data or external inputs are directly processed in a manner that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads static files (version.py and README.md) and defines package setup configuration without dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The script strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines, including reading version info, long description, and defining dependencies. All file reads are from controlled, static sources. No data is processed from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles package metadata and dependencies securely without any suspicious logic or backdoors.",
