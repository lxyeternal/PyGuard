  "flows": "Reads version info and long description from files; then executes setup() to prepare the package for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard setup script with straightforward file reads and package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information from a file, loads long description content, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The code structure and content are typical of Python package setup scripts, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script for yfinance. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It only manages package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
