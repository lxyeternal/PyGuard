  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging the `yfinance` library.\n   - The script reads version info from `yfinance/version.py` and the long description from `README.md`.\n   - It defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.\n   - The print statement at the end is benign, providing a disclaimer.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n   - The code is typical for Python package setup.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, which is justified since there's no security risk.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable. No report suggests any malicious or suspicious activity.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), which aligns with the clear, standard code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe setup script is entirely benign. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's content and behavior.",
