  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging the 'yfinance' library.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior is detected.\n- The code reads version info from a static file and loads a README for description.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or secret handling is present.\n- The print statement at the end is benign, serving as a disclaimer.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code matches the description in all reports.\n- No issues are present in the code logic or structure.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential points to challenge or verify:**\n\n- The version reading from 'yfinance/version.py' is straightforward; no dynamic code execution or code injection.\n- The print statement at the end is harmless.\n- The dependencies are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n- No suspicious code paths, such as code that could be exploited or used maliciously, are evident.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk: 0 is appropriate; no untrusted data handling or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate; no changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and appropriate for distribution.",
