  "purpose": "Setup script for the yfinance Python package, used to package and distribute the market data downloader.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'yfinance/version.py'; reading long description from 'README.md'; package metadata and dependencies defined in setup()",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no network or file operations that handle untrusted input are present in this script",
  "flows": "N/A – the script primarily reads static files and defines package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; standard setup.py packaging practices are followed, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a typical Python package setup script. It reads version info from a dedicated version file, loads a README for description, and configures package metadata including dependencies and classifiers. There are no network connections, data handling, or execution of untrusted code. All imports and operations are standard and safe. The print statement at the end is harmless and provides user guidance. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs package configuration tasks safely and does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code. Overall security risk is minimal.",
