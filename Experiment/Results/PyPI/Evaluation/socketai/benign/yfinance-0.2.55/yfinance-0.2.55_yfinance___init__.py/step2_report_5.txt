  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard package initialization script for 'yfinance'.\n- No external inputs, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code is identified.\n- The code mainly imports modules, sets package metadata, and configures warnings.\n- The reported \"malware\" score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is also 0, aligning with the absence of security concerns.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the typical structure of an __init__.py or main module for a Python package.\n- No evidence of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are uniformly positive and do not identify any issues. Given the simplicity of the code, this seems accurate.\n- The \"malware\" score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign and aligns with standard open-source package setup practices.\n- No modifications needed to the scores.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a typical, safe package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
