  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is evident within this code fragment; it primarily imports modules and sets warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code follows standard package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, license comments, and warning filters. There are no inputs being read from external sources, nor are there any outputs or actions that could be malicious. No obfuscated code, network calls, or sensitive data handling are visible. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard open-source financial data downloader package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only imports modules and sets warnings, which is common in Python packages.",
