  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard package initialization script for 'yfinance'.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or input processing are present.\n- The code only imports internal modules, sets package metadata, and configures warnings.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n- The code is consistent with typical open-source Python package setup files.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that processes untrusted data, performs network communication, or writes to external systems.\n- The only notable behavior is setting a warning filter, which is benign.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or backdoors are detected.\n- The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions are made about hidden behaviors.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for an open-source package's __init__.py or main module.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriately assigned, and the reasoning is solid.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Confirm the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard package setup script with no security concerns. The scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent.",
