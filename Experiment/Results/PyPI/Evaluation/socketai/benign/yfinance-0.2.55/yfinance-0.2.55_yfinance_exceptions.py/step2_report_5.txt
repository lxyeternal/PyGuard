  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions related to Yahoo Finance API error handling.\n   - No external inputs, data processing, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - Since the code is benign, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - This is appropriate because the code is purely for error handling and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - No unwarranted claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is standard exception class definitions with no security implications.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Score |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Malware        | 0      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0      |\n| Security Risk  | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a well-structured, straightforward set of exception classes for error handling in a Python application interacting with Yahoo Finance API.",
