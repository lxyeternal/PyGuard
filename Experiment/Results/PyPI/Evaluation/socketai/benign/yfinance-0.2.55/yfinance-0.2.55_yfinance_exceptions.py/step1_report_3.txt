  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions related to Yahoo API data fetching.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data; only class definitions and exception messages.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no untrusted data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions. Each class initializes with specific parameters to generate descriptive error messages. No external data input, network calls, or data processing is performed. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to serve a purpose of structured error handling within a larger application related to Yahoo finance data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception class definitions with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical application code for error management. No malware or security concerns are detected.",
