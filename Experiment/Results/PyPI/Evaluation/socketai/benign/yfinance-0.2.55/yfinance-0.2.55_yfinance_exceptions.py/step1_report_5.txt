  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to Yahoo API data fetching and processing.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; all code consists of class definitions and constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as there are no data inputs or processing flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code solely defines exception classes with descriptive messages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of custom exception class definitions, primarily used for error handling. It includes constructors that format error messages and store relevant context. No external data, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard, benign exception class definitions for a Python project interacting with Yahoo API data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks.",
