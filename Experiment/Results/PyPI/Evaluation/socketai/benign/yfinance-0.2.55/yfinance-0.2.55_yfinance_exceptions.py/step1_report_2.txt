{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to Yahoo Finance API interactions.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external data handling in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be straightforward class definitions without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions. The classes include constructors for specific error messages related to Yahoo Finance API errors such as missing data, invalid periods, or rate limits. There are no input reading, data processing, or external data outputs. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as code injection, network activity, or data theft, are present. The code appears to be part of a larger, well-structured application handling API errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clean, straightforward, and serves its purpose without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
