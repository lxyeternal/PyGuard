  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Yahoo Finance API errors.\n   - No external inputs, data processing, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n   - The exception classes are straightforward, with no suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no security risks.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and purpose, these assessments are accurate.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These seem appropriate, as the code is purely definitional and non-malicious.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is safe and standard; thus, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - No suspicious behavior is present.\n   - Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unfounded assumptions; they recognize the code as purely exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional Justification:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes.\n- No external data, network calls, or code execution occurs.\n- No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling in a larger application.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, safe, and standard. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis that the code is purely definitional, with no security concerns.",
