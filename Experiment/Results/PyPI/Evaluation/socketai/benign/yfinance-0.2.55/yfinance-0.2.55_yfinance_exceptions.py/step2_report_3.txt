  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in exceptions.\n   - These classes are tailored for handling errors related to Yahoo Finance API interactions, such as missing data, invalid periods, rate limits, etc.\n   - The constructors mainly format descriptive error messages based on parameters, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no data input, output, network activity, or other operational logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**:\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, write to files, or execute any code that could be malicious.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - Exception messages are straightforward and serve as error indicators within a larger application context.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Anomalies**:\n   - The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for error handling.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or anomalies are detected.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0. The code shows no signs of malicious intent.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0. The code is purely definitional, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations**:\n   - All reports assign a **malware** score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The **security risk** score is also 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The **confidence** is 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature of this code.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, safe component of an application that handles API errors.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware**: 0\n  - **Obfuscated**: 0\n  - **Risk**: 0\n\nThese reflect the code's benign, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated nature.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a set of well-structured, standard exception classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Note**: No changes needed; the assessment aligns with the code's characteristics.",
