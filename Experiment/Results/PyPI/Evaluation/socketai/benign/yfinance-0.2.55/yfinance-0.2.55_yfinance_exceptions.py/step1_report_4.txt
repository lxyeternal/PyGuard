{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to Yahoo Finance API interactions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception instantiation occurs within the code, typically with static or parameterized strings.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages generated and potentially logged or displayed; no direct untrusted data sink present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exception objects are created with provided parameters but without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Exception handling appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from standard Python exceptions. No data input/output, network activity, or code execution is present. All exception messages are constructed from parameters or static strings, with no user input handling or external data parsing. The class hierarchy and methods are typical for structured error handling in Python modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code appears to serve as a structured way to signal specific errors related to Yahoo Finance data retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely definitional, establishing exception classes for use elsewhere. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated elements. It is safe and standard in design.",
