{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Yahoo Finance API errors, such as missing data, invalid periods, and rate limits.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to exception constructors (e.g., ticker, method_name, debug_info, invalid_period, valid_ranges)",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "N/A; exception classes are instantiated with parameters but do not process untrusted input or perform data flow operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception or its subclasses, mainly for error reporting related to Yahoo API. No external input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs. Exception messages are simple and based on parameters. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is purely definitional, serving as error indicators within a larger application. All signals point to benign, standard error handling classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
