  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling Yahoo Finance API errors.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, contains no external data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n- Exception messages are simple and based on parameters; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- The highest reported risk score is 0, which seems appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- No indication of security vulnerabilities, supply chain risks, or malicious intent.\n\n**Analysis of each report:**\n- All reports are consistent and agree that the code is purely definitional, with no external input handling, no data flow, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose across reports is to define error handling classes, which is standard practice.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only minor note is that some exception classes (e.g., `YFEarningsDateMissing`) are not used or raised in the code snippet, but this does not imply maliciousness.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and safe.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign and safe.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a set of standard custom exception classes for error handling in a Yahoo API client context. It presents no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scoring and analysis are aligned with the code's nature.",
