  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions related to Yahoo Finance API errors.\n   - No external input, data processing, network activity, or external effects are present.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is solely for defining exception classes.\n   - They accurately note the absence of external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - No signs of backdoors, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they focus on the benign nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for handling Yahoo Finance API errors. It does not pose any security threat, contain malware, or exhibit obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
