{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Yahoo Finance API interactions.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data are parameters within exception class constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; code solely defines exception classes without data output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input leading to external effects; only exception initialization with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception messages are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exceptions, tailored for Yahoo API error handling. No external inputs are processed within this code. The classes include constructors that format error messages based on provided parameters, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious logic. The exception messages and class structures are typical and serve the purpose of categorizing errors. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of well-structured custom exception classes for handling Yahoo API errors. There is no malicious behavior, no data leakage, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It appears to be standard application code focused on error handling.",
