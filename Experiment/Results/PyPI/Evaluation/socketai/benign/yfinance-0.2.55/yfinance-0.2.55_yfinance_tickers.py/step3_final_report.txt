  "purpose": "Manage multiple stock tickers, fetch historical data and news from Yahoo Finance via external modules.",
  "sources": "Input tickers, parameters for data retrieval, network requests via multi.download.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from multi.download, news data from Ticker.news.",
  "flows": "Input tickers -> __init__ (convert to uppercase) -> download (calls multi.download) -> data stored in self.tickers -> returned data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Minor inconsistency in default 'group_by' parameter overridden internally, but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for fetching financial data, relying on external modules. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. Input handling is standard, and no vulnerabilities are evident within this snippet. External dependencies are critical points but cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, assuming external modules are secure. No further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
