  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for managing the __all__ attribute of Python modules, including adding, testing, and retrieving module members.",
  "sources": "inspect.getouterframes(), inspect.getmodule(), module.__dict__, inspect.currentframe(), inspect.ismodule()",
  "sinks": "setattr(), module.__dict__.setdefault(), getattr(), hasattr()",
  "flows": "inspect.getouterframes() -> _caller_modules() -> __all__ manipulation functions (e.g., __all__append, _publish, add, public) -> module attribute modifications",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of inspect module is for introspection purposes only. No hardcoded secrets or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the inspect module extensively for introspection to determine calling modules, manipulate their __all__ attributes, and validate module contents. The functions add and public modify the __all__ attribute of the caller's module, which is a common practice in Python for managing exports. The test function verifies the presence of listed __all__ members. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leaks, or hidden backdoors. The code is well-structured, and all operations serve development and debugging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing module exports and introspection, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
