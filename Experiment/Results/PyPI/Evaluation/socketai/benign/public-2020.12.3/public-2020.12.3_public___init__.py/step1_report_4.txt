{
  "purpose": "The code manages and manipulates the __all__ attribute of Python modules, allowing dynamic addition and validation of module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes (__dict__, __all__, __name__), the current call stack (inspect.getouterframes, inspect.currentframe), and input objects to add or validate.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the dynamic modification of module __all__ attributes and the access to module dictionaries, which could be exploited if malicious objects or data are passed in.",
  "flows": "Objects provided to 'add' or 'public' are added to the caller module's __all__ list through _publish and __all__append; 'test' validates existence of names in module.__all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code dynamically modifies module attributes but does so in a controlled manner, without any obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically manipulates the __all__ attribute of modules, mainly for managing exports. It inspects call stacks to identify caller modules, then updates their __all__ list with new objects or names, avoiding duplicates. The 'test' function verifies that listed exports exist in the module. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data access is present. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to serve a utility purpose with proper safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a utility for managing module exports, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs safe, controlled modifications of module attributes and includes validation functions. Overall, it appears benign.",
