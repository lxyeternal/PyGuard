  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for managing module exports via introspection. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal concern due to dynamic attribute manipulation, which is typical for such utilities. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in supply chain contexts."
