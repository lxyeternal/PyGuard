  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing the __all__ attribute in Python modules, enabling dynamic export management and introspection of caller modules.",
  "sources": "Uses inspect.getouterframes() and inspect.getmodule() to identify caller frames and modules, and accesses module dictionaries for __all__ management.",
  "sinks": "Modifies module.__dict__['__all__']' and sets attributes on modules; no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "From caller frames via inspect to module dictionaries for updating __all__, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; straightforward use of inspect for module introspection.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to add objects or names to a module’s __all__ attribute, using inspect to determine caller modules. It prevents duplicates, handles string and object inputs, and verifies module exports. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The code is a benign utility for development purposes, with low security risk and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for managing module exports via introspection. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal concern due to dynamic attribute manipulation, which is typical for such utilities. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in supply chain contexts.",
