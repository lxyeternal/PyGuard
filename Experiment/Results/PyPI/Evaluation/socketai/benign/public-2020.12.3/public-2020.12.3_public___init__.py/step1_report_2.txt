{
  "purpose": "The code appears to manage and manipulate the '__all__' attribute of Python modules, providing functions to add objects to the module's export list and validate module exports.",
  "sources": "inspect.getouterframes(), inspect.getmodule(), inspect.currentframe(), module.__dict__",
  "sinks": "setattr(module, \"__all__\", ...), module.__dict__.setdefault('__all__', [])",
  "flows": "Source: inspect functions (getouterframes, getmodule, currentframe) -> Data stored or modified in module.__dict__ -> Potential exposure via setattr/setdefault",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code behaviors detected. Code comments suggest incomplete or placeholder code. The code is primarily reflective and manipulative of module attributes, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the inspect module to analyze call stacks and modules, then manages the '__all__' attribute dynamically. It avoids duplicate entries, supports adding multiple objects, and includes a test function to verify module exports. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code is well-structured and typical for dynamic module management. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for managing module exports and testing module consistency. It does not contain malicious behaviors, security risks, or supply chain sabotage. The functions are safe and serve typical introspection purposes.",
