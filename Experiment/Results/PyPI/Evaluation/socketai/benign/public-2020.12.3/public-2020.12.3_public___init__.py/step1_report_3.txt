{
  "purpose": "The code appears to manage and manipulate the '__all__' attribute of modules, providing functions to add, test, and retrieve module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes (__dict__, __all__, __name__) and the call stack via inspect.getouterframes and inspect.getmodule.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain typical sinks such as network, file writes, or system commands. It manipulates module attributes and object references within the process.",
  "flows": "The functions _caller_modules() retrieves calling modules; add() and public() update the __all__ attribute of caller modules; test() inspects module attributes for validation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent anomalies or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code does use inspect module extensively, which could be misused in other contexts but is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities for managing module exports via __all__, including adding objects, testing module __all__ entries, and retrieving caller modules. It relies on inspect to dynamically examine call frames and module attributes, which is typical for development tools. No network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are identified. All functions are designed for code organization and testing support. No signals of malicious intent or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing __all__ attributes of Python modules, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions and appears safe for use in a development or testing context.",
