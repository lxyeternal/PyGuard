  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'public', defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies list could be manipulated if 'requirements.txt' is tampered with; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'requirements.txt' content and passes it to 'install_requires' during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read dependencies directly without validation or sandboxing, which is standard but can be risky if 'requirements.txt' is compromised. No suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata. The 'install_requires' parameter dynamically reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt'. This is a common pattern, but it assumes the 'requirements.txt' file is secure and untampered. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with dependencies read from an external file. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code snippet.",
