  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'public', specifying its version and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'requirements.txt' file to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processed beyond reading dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and passing them to 'install_requires'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read dependencies from an external file at import time is somewhat unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata. It dynamically reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' using open(), which could lead to errors if the file is missing or manipulated but does not introduce malicious behavior. No suspicious code or backdoors are present. The structure is standard for package setup scripts. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging Python projects. It reads dependencies from an external file without any malicious intent. No security risks or malware are evident.",
