  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'public', installing dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data output or external data flow observed.",
  "flows": "Reading 'requirements.txt' as input during installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'requirements.txt' during setup can be risky if the file contents are manipulated, but this is common in setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with parameters: name, version, install_requires, and packages. The install_requires parameter dynamically reads from 'requirements.txt'. This is a typical pattern in setup scripts. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic. No external network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package. No malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It merely reads dependencies from a file and initiates package setup.",
