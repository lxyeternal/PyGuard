  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' during setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'requirements.txt' directly within setup() is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls its setup() function to prepare a Python package. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' using open().read().splitlines(), which is a common approach but could be risky if 'requirements.txt' contains malicious entries. No other suspicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation, is present. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard packaging code with a slightly unconventional method of reading dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup tasks with minimal risk; no malicious intent or security issues are evident. The unconventional reading of dependencies does not pose a security threat.",
