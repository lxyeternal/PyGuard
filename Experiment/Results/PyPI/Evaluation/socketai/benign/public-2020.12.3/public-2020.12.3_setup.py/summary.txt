  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of open() to read dependencies is typical but unconventional. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use."
