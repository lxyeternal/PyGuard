  "purpose": "To load package dependencies from 'requirements.txt' during setup, facilitating package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file via open() during setuptools.setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential issues if 'requirements.txt' is missing or tampered with, affecting dependency installation.",
  "flows": "open('requirements.txt') -> read() -> splitlines() -> install_requires parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() within setup() is unconventional; no error handling for missing file; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' using open() and read(). This pattern is common but slightly unconventional, as it can cause runtime errors if the file is missing. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The reliance on external files is a minor operational concern but not a security threat. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. The code is straightforward and standard for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of open() to read dependencies is typical but unconventional. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
