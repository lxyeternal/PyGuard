{
  "purpose": "This code provides extension functions to the Python standard library for safely importing modules and checking attributes, intended to facilitate optional dependencies and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads module names in try_import and try_imports functions, and object attributes in safe_hasattr.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is being processed into critical functions that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input data (module names and attribute names) flows into try_import and safe_hasattr functions, but these are used for safe import and attribute checks, not executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code contains straightforward logic for optional imports and attribute checking. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for attempting to import modules or modules sequences, with fallback options, and a safe attribute checker. The functions handle errors gracefully and avoid exceptions from propagating. The implementation uses standard techniques with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code appears to be utility functions for safe module handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for safe module import and attribute checking, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
