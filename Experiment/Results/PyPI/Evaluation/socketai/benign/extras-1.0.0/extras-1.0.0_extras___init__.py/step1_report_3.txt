{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for safe importing of modules and attribute checking in Python, extending standard library capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters: 'name' in try_import, 'module_names' in try_imports, 'obj' and 'attr' in safe_hasattr.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network, file, or environment variable manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "User input (module names and attribute names) flows through try_import and try_imports functions, which perform import operations and attribute access. No external data sources or sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. The code is straightforward utility functions. No code injection or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements safe module importing and attribute checking functions with error handling and fallback options. It uses standard Python mechanisms without dynamic code execution or external data manipulation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are identified. The functions are designed to improve robustness and error handling in module import scenarios, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library aimed at safer module imports and attribute checks. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured extension of standard Python capabilities.",
