  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for safer and more flexible importing of modules and attribute checks within Python projects.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys module, access to sys.modules, and functions that perform dynamic attribute access and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted module names passed into try_import and try_imports functions, dynamic attribute access via getattr.",
  "flows": "User supplies module names to try_import/try_imports, which attempt to import modules or access nested attributes; data flows from input parameters through import and attribute retrieval logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or obfuscated code; use of dynamic import functions is standard for optional dependencies, not malicious. No code exhibits unusual or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for attempting to import modules and access attributes safely. try_import splits module names and dynamically imports nested modules, handling errors via callbacks or alternatives. try_imports tries multiple modules sequentially, returning the first successful import or raising an exception. safe_hasattr provides a robust way to check for attributes without being affected by property exceptions. The code uses standard Python practices for dynamic imports and safe attribute access, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The dynamic import functions could be misused if supplied with malicious module names, but this is typical for optional dependency handling and does not indicate malicious behavior on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard, safe utility operations related to module importing and attribute checking. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of dynamic imports is consistent with typical optional dependency patterns and does not raise security concerns.",
