{
  "purpose": "Provide extension functions for safe module import attempts and attribute checking within Python standard library enhancements.",
  "sources": "The code reads module names for import attempts (try_import, try_imports) and object attributes (safe_hasattr).",
  "sinks": "Potentially returns imported modules or attributes; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input module names flow through try_import and try_imports to import modules; attribute names flow through safe_hasattr for attribute checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Functions perform standard import and attribute checks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for robust module importing and attribute checking. It handles multiple import attempts and error callbacks without executing untrusted code or external network operations. No obfuscated language features or malicious patterns are present. The functions rely on standard Python mechanisms with proper error handling, and do not appear to perform any malicious activity or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for safer dynamic importing and attribute checking. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. It adheres to best practices for exception handling and import attempts.",
