  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides extension functions for safe module import and attribute checking. It reads module names and attribute names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No sinks; input flows into functions for safe import and attribute check.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code. Straightforward utility functions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, no malicious behavior, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (appropriate) given benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe import and attribute checking, with no suspicious patterns.  \n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), perhaps due to the dynamic nature of import attempts, but still benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (acceptable, given dynamic imports, but no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Same conclusion: utility functions for safe import and attribute check, no malicious code or anomalies.  \n- No obfuscation or malware detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar analysis: safe, standard utility functions, no suspicious activity.  \n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Slightly more detailed, emphasizing that dynamic import functions are standard for optional dependencies, with no malicious intent.  \n- Security risk score is 0.1, reflecting potential misuse if supplied malicious module names, but not malicious per se.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (reasonable)\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are 0.  \n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.1) in some reports due to the dynamic import capability, which could be misused but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.  \n- The only point to consider is whether a higher security risk score (e.g., 0.2) is warranted due to the potential misuse of dynamic import functions. However, given that the code is utility functions intended for safe import, and no evidence of malicious behavior exists, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the potential for misuse but not actual malicious intent)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is standard, safe utility functions with minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The slight security risk score is justified due to the dynamic import capabilities, but it does not indicate malicious activity. The scores should remain as they are, with perhaps a minor note that the security risk could be marginally increased if the functions are used improperly, but this is typical for such utility code.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the report evaluations are appropriate.",
