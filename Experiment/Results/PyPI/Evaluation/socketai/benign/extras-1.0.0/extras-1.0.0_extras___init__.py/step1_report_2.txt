  "purpose": "Provide extended utility functions for safe module importing and attribute checking in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads module names for import attempts and object attributes for existence checks.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that execute untrusted data or perform harmful actions directly.",
  "flows": "Input (module names, attribute names) flows through try_import, try_imports, and safe_hasattr functions to return modules or attribute existence status.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; functions perform standard import handling and attribute checks without suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements utility functions for attempting to import modules and handling failures gracefully, with optional error callbacks and fallback alternatives. The try_import function navigates module hierarchies dynamically, which is standard for optional dependencies management. The try_imports function iterates over multiple module names, attempting to import each until success or fallback. The safe_hasattr function safely checks attribute existence, avoiding exception swallowing issues. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be standard utility code for dependency management and robustness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility functions for safe module import and attribute checking. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior identified.",
