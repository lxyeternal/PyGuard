  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for safe module import and attribute checking, facilitating optional dependencies and avoiding import errors.",
  "sources": "Module names and attribute names supplied as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; data flows into import and attribute access functions, which do not execute untrusted code directly.",
  "flows": "Input module names flow into try_import and try_imports functions, which attempt to import modules and access attributes safely.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard utility functions for safe dynamic importing and attribute checking. It handles errors gracefully, supports fallback options, and avoids executing untrusted code directly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are designed for dependency management and are commonly used in Python projects. The potential misuse of dynamic import functions with malicious module names is a general concern but does not indicate malicious intent in this code. The code's structure and logic are sound, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility module for safe module import and attribute access. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, but 0.1 remains a reasonable conservative estimate given the potential for misuse in untrusted contexts.",
