  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility module for safe module import and attribute access. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, but 0.1 remains a reasonable conservative estimate given the potential for misuse in untrusted contexts."
