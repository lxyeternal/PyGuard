  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code provides safe import and attribute check functions. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or backdoors detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified, as utility functions are benign.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to dynamic import capabilities, but still benign.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates benign nature, standard dynamic import and attribute checking, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms utility functions are safe, with no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion; functions are standard, with a note that dynamic import could be misused if supplied malicious module names, but this is typical for optional dependencies.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — acknowledges potential misuse but not malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — slightly less than others, but still high.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a set of utility functions for safe module importing and attribute checking.\n- **Malware Risk:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The functions are standard and do not perform any harmful actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low; primarily depends on external input (module names), which is expected in such utility functions. The slight risk noted (0.1) is justified by the potential for misuse if malicious module names are supplied, but this is a common concern with dynamic imports, not a sign of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The **security risk score** can be slightly above zero (around **0.1**) to reflect the potential misuse of dynamic import functions with untrusted input, but overall, the code itself is benign.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **overall risk score** should be low, around **0.1**, considering the potential for misuse but no inherent malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis across all reports, emphasizing that the code is a benign utility library with minimal inherent risk, primarily related to how it might be misused in untrusted contexts.",
