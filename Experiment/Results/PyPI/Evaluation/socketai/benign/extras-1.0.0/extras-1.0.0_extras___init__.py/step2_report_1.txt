  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations from the code:**\n\n- The code provides utility functions (`try_import`, `try_imports`, `safe_hasattr`) for safe module import attempts and attribute checking.\n- The functions include error handling, fallback options, and avoid exceptions propagating unexpectedly.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or external data manipulation are present.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured utility functions for dependency management.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** Benign utility functions for safe import and attribute checking, no malicious code or backdoors.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is accurate; the code is straightforward.  \n- The risk score of 0.5 might be slightly high given the benign nature, but since dynamic import functions could potentially be misused if misconfigured, a low risk score (e.g., 0.1) might be more appropriate.  \n- Malware score is correctly 0.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Lower the risk score from 0.5 to 0.1, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** Similar utility functions, no suspicious behavior, standard techniques.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is consistent.  \n- The risk score of 0.1 aligns with the potential misuse if module names are supplied maliciously, but in a controlled environment, this is minimal.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Standard safe import and attribute check functions, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correct; no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** Utility functions for safe module import and attribute checking, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is accurate.  \n- The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Utility functions, dynamic imports, safe attribute access, standard patterns, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is consistent.  \n- The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable given the potential for misuse if supplied with malicious module names, but this is typical for such utility functions.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is accurate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- The risk scores are slightly conservative but reasonable, given that dynamic import functions could be misused if supplied malicious input.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and My Own Estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard for utility functions that perform dynamic imports, acknowledging potential misuse if inputs are malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented utility module for safe importing and attribute checking. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with minor room for lowering the risk score to reflect the benign nature more accurately.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1",
