{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for safe dynamic importing and attribute checking, along with associated unit tests to validate their behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads module names for import, attribute names for checking, and module objects for validation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic import functions which could execute untrusted module names, leading to security risks if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Source: module name strings or attribute names -> function calls (try_import, try_imports, safe_hasattr) -> module or attribute objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard use of importlib and property decorators. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements safe import mechanisms with error callbacks, and tests verify correct behavior. No network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The dynamic import functions could pose risks if used with untrusted input, but in this controlled test context, the risk is minimal. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python features. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility and test code for safe module import and attribute access. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
