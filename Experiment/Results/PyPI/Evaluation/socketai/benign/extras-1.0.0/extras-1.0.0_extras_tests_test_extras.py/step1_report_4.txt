{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for safely importing modules and attributes, along with test cases to verify their behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads module names, attribute names, and import results from function parameters and sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the import statements and attribute access, which could execute untrusted code if module names are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Untrusted module names or attribute names are passed to try_import and try_imports, leading to dynamic import and attribute access, which could execute malicious code if these inputs are controlled by an attacker.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a set of test functions and utility implementations with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unnecessary dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily composed of test cases for import utility functions. These functions safely handle import failures using error callbacks and default fallbacks. The use of sys.modules to simulate module presence is standard. No evidence of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection, is found. The functions operate solely within the Python import system, which by itself is not suspicious. The overall structure is typical for testing and utility functions, with no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility and test suite for safe dynamic importing, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It is safe based on the provided content.",
