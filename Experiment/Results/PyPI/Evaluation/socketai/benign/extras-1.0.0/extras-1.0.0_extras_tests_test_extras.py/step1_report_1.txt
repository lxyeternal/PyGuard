{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement utility functions for safely importing modules and attributes, as well as safe attribute checking, with associated unit tests.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the module imports, attribute access, and test parameters such as module names and attribute names.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic import attempts and attribute access, which could lead to execution of malicious code if module names or attribute names are manipulated.",
  "flows": "The code flows from input parameters (module and attribute names) into import functions (try_import, try_imports) and safe_hasattr, which perform dynamic attribute access and module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard import mechanisms and property definitions. No suspicious network activity or file operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for safe module and attribute import with error handling, along with comprehensive unit tests for these functions. The import functions use standard Python mechanisms, checking for existing modules, handling submodules, and invoking error callbacks. No malicious code patterns, such as network activity, system modification, or obfuscation, are present. The test cases validate the correctness of these utilities. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate testing suite for import safety mechanisms, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of safe utility functions and their unit tests for importing modules and attributes securely. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code uses standard Python features appropriately, and the logic is straightforward. Therefore, it can be considered safe with a low malware likelihood.",
