  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the associated scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements utility functions for safe importing and attribute checking, with tests. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, using standard Python import mechanisms.\n- No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate, considering the dynamic import functions could be misused if inputs are malicious, but in this context, they are controlled.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on utility functions and tests for safe imports, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard testing code.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Risk score of 0 aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and tests for safe import, attribute checks, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code patterns.\n- The minimal risk score is appropriate.\n- The functions are standard and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and tests, with potential for dynamic import, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Dynamic import functions can be risky if inputs are untrusted, but in testing context, this is controlled.\n- No malicious behavior observed.\n- The risk score is reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Tests for safe import functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious code.\n- The scores are justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code content. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential misuse of dynamic imports if inputs are malicious, but in the context of controlled tests, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n- No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The low security risk scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering potential misuse of dynamic import functions in untrusted contexts, but acceptable here)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review and the code's benign nature.",
