  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements utility functions for safe importing and attribute checking, with comprehensive tests. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are evident.\n- **Findings:** The code uses standard import mechanisms, error callbacks, and properties. No signs of malicious activity, such as network access, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior. The test suite validates import safety, not malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions and tests for safe imports, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** Uses standard dynamic import patterns, error handling, and module manipulations. No external network activity or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0–0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely for testing import robustness, with no malicious payloads.\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and tests for safe module import, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Standard dynamic import and attribute access, with error handling. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. This aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscation; the code is straightforward testing code.\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and tests for dynamic imports, with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, uses standard Python import mechanisms. No external communication or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code is testing safe import patterns, not malicious payloads.\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Unit tests for import functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Standard testing code, no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0–0.1 fit the benign profile.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely for testing safe import mechanisms.\n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but all very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I agree with the scores assigned in all reports. The code is standard utility and test code for safe dynamic importing, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (to reflect minimal inherent risk in dynamic import code, but still very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with negligible security risk, and no malicious intent.",
