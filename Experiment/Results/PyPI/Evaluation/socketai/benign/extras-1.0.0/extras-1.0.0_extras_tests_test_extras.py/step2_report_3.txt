  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code implements utility functions for safe importing and attribute checking, with associated tests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes dynamic import and attribute access as potential sinks, which is accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code uses standard import mechanisms, and the tests validate expected behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes low malware risk; high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable given the context of dynamic imports, but no actual malicious activity)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code is utility and test functions for safe imports, with no malicious activity detected.\n- Correctly notes that dynamic imports could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted but points out the controlled testing environment.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is identified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (appropriate) given the benign nature of the code)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the utility functions and tests, with similar observations.\n- Correctly notes that dynamic import functions could pose risks if inputs are untrusted, but in this context, they are controlled.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (slightly higher, but still negligible, considering the use of dynamic import functions in a test context)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar assessment: utility functions and tests, standard import mechanisms.\n- No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- Recognizes that untrusted module names could be risky but notes the controlled environment.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher, but still minimal and justified given the dynamic import context)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Again, confirms that the code is a test suite for import functions, with no malicious intent.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Recognizes that dynamic imports could be risky if inputs are untrusted but in this context, it's safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is standard testing and utility functions for safe dynamic imports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally very low, reflecting the controlled testing environment and standard practices.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the code's nature—utility functions and tests for safe module importing—there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The dynamic import functions are used in a controlled testing context, with error callbacks and fallback mechanisms.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to 0.2 at most, considering the potential risks of dynamic import if inputs are manipulated, but no actual malicious activity is present)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are reasonable. The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities evident.",
