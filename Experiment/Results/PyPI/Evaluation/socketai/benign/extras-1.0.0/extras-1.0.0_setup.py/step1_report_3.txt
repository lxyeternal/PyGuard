  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the 'extras' Python package, intended to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description, importing 'extras' module, accessing 'extras.__version__'",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data outputs or external commands are executed",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' → retrieving 'extras.__version__' → returning version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with typical functions and imports",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: importing 'setuptools', defining functions to get version and description, and configuring 'setup()' parameters. It conditionally includes a test command if available. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external network interactions, and no obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
