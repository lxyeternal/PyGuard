{
  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the 'extras' Python package, including optional test commands.",
  "sources": "Reading __version__ from extras, reading README.rst file for long description",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data reads are limited to static version info and file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of open() without context management is noted but not malicious. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, defining functions to get version and description, configuring setup parameters. It imports extras, which may be a custom module, and attempts to import a test command. No unsafe code, external untrusted inputs, or malicious behavior are detected. The file reads static version info and a README file, both safe operations. No signs of data leakage, malicious code, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs expected package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
