  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup script, reading version info from `extras.__version__` and README for description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks or data flows; only static reads.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior. The use of `open()` without context management is noted but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence, no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it notes standard setup procedures, no untrusted data handling, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also accurate, high confidence, benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations: standard package setup, safe operations, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, high confidence, no security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the typical setup script behavior, safe reads, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence, benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Provides detailed flow analysis, confirms safe reading of files, retrieval of version info, no untrusted data sinks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script.\n- **Use of `open()` without context manager?** Not ideal but not malicious.\n- **Importing `extras` and optional test command?** Standard practice.\n- **Any signs of obfuscation or suspicious code?** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** No, the script only reads static files and metadata.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0.1 or similar is acceptable, but perhaps a 0.0 would be more precise.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the open() usage, but minimal)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that `extras.__version__` and `extras.try_import()` are from trusted sources. If `extras` is a trusted internal module, then no concerns. If it were untrusted, the risk could increase, but based on the provided code and reports, there's no indication of malicious behavior.",
