  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'extras' Python package, configuring metadata and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads 'extras.__version__' attribute and 'README.rst' file content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads and attribute access only.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from module attribute and file content to setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open()' without context manager, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that imports 'setuptools', retrieves version info from the 'extras' module, reads the README file for a long description, and conditionally adds a test command. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or handling of untrusted input. The use of 'open()' without a context manager is a stylistic concern but not a security issue. The code's purpose is benign, aimed at packaging and distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal concern about 'open()' usage does not impact security. All signals and reports correctly identify the code as safe.",
