  "purpose": "Define and load a test suite for the 'extras' package tests.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'unittest' and local module 'extras.tests'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; code does not process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code loads test modules but does not handle external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward test setup code with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the unittest framework and defines a function to load tests from the 'extras.tests' module. It uses 'TestLoader' to load test cases and constructs a 'TestSuite'. The code appears to be standard test setup code with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It solely manages test loading, with no network activity, data processing, or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal test suite setup with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It simply loads and returns a test suite for local testing purposes.",
