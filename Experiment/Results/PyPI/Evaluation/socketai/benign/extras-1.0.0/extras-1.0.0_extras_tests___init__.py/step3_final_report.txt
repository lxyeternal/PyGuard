  "purpose": "Load and execute test cases for the 'extras' package using unittest framework.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external data, or network operations involved.",
  "flows": "Imports test module, loads tests via TestLoader, returns TestSuite.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite setup, importing unittest components and a test module, then loading and returning a TestSuite. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code. The purpose is solely to organize and run tests, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard test setup code with no security risks or malicious behavior. The initial reports correctly identify this, but report 5's security risk score of 0.1 is unwarranted given the code's simplicity. It should be adjusted to 0.",
