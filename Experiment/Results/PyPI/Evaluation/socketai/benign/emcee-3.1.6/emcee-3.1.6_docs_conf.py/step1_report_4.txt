  "sources": "get_distribution('emcee').version",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or sensitive data exposure points.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior observed. The version retrieval is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration parameters for documentation generation using Sphinx and related tools. It attempts to retrieve the package version securely through pkg_resources. All extensions and options are standard for documentation purposes. No code injection, malicious data leaks, or suspicious network activities are present. The code's structure and logic are typical and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for documentation, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and unlikely to pose any security threat.",
