  "purpose": "Configuration and version retrieval for the 'emcee' Python package, including documentation build settings and HTML theme customization.",
  "sources": "get_distribution('emcee') call to retrieve package version; static configuration variables for documentation and HTML presentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external inputs or outputs processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "Version info fetched from get_distribution flows into __version__ variable used for display.",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_distribution from pkg_resources to obtain version is standard; no suspicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically determine the package version using pkg_resources.get_distribution, which is a common practice. The rest of the code is static configuration for documentation and HTML presentation with no external data inputs or risky operations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscated code, malicious scripts, or suspicious network activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration script for a Python documentation project. No malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior identified.",
