  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup, retrieving 'emcee' package version and setting up extensions, themes, and static resources.",
  "sources": "get_distribution('emcee').version for version info, static configuration data for extensions, themes, and paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration with no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of package version (source) to setting version variables (sink); static configuration data setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration, no obfuscation, no dynamic code, no secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard practices for package version retrieval and static configuration for documentation. It contains no user input, network calls, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. All signals indicate a benign setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The exception handling for version retrieval is standard, and the static paths and URLs are typical for documentation projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for documentation purposes. It performs no malicious actions, data leaks, or obfuscation. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are accurate and justified.",
