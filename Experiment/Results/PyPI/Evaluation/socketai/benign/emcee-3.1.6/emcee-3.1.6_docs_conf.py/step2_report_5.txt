  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a straightforward configuration for documentation, with version retrieval via `get_distribution`. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard configuration practices, static URLs, and safe version retrieval.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — negligible security risk.\n- **Comments:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a standard setup with no suspicious elements.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Well justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard configuration, safe practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, standard use of `pkg_resources.get_distribution` and static configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports agree that the code is a standard configuration script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the logic and reasoning are sound.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign zero malware, obfuscated, and risk scores, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations.\n- **Malware concern:** None. The code simply retrieves package version info and sets configuration parameters.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### Personal estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard configuration script with no security concerns.",
