  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to a variable for package metadata, a standard practice in Python packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or outputs; the code does not interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct assignment of a version string to __version__, a common pattern for package metadata. It involves no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
