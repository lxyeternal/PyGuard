{
  "purpose": "The script processes text files to replace specific markdown-like patterns with a simplified version, effectively sanitizing or modifying link formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input filenames from command line arguments, opens each file for reading.",
  "sinks": "Writes back the modified text to the same files; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Command line args -> file read -> regex substitution -> file write.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The regex operation is straightforward and designed for text processing.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts filenames as command-line arguments. For each file, it opens and reads the content, then applies a regex substitution to replace patterns matching :(.+):``(.+)`` with the same pattern but with the inner content outside the backticks. It then writes the modified content back to the original file. There are no external network calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious code patterns present. The code is simple, transparent, and intended for text formatting or cleaning.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic file read/write and string substitution with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility script.",
