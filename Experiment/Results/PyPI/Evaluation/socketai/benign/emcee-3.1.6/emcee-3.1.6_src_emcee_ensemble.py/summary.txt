  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an ensemble MCMC sampler with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The main security consideration is the execution of user-supplied likelihood functions, which is expected and not malicious. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are justified and appropriate."
