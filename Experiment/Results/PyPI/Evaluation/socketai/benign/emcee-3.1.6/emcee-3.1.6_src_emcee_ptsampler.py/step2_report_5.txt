  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward dependency import wrapper with fallback behavior. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code simply attempts to import a class from an external package and, if unavailable, defines a class that raises an informative ImportError.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a standard pattern for handling optional dependencies, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1.0 (high confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0  \n   \n   These scores are reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate. The code is purely for dependency management and contains no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis, confirming the absence of malicious patterns.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\nGiven the simplicity and transparency of the code, I agree with the assessments provided. The code's purpose is solely to manage optional dependencies gracefully, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reports and the actual code behavior.",
