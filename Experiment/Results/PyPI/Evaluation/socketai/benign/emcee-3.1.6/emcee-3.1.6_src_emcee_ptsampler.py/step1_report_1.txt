  "purpose": "Define and provide an import fallback for the PTSampler class from the ptemcee package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for ptemcee module, class initialization in the fallback class.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import PTSampler from ptemcee; if failed, raise ImportError with a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code cleanly handles missing dependency with a clear error message.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import PTSampler from the ptemcee package. If the import fails, it defines a fallback class that raises an ImportError with instructions on where to find the package. The class is designed solely for import error handling and user guidance, with no execution beyond that. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, code obfuscation, or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a straightforward dependency import fallback with user guidance. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It simply ensures that users are informed about the missing package and where to obtain it.",
