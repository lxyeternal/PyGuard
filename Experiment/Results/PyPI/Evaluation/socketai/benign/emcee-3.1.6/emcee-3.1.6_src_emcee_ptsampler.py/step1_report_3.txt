  "purpose": "Defines a wrapper for the PTSampler class from the ptemcee package, providing an ImportError message if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statement for ptemcee's PTSampler, and the custom class definition if import fails.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import a class; if it fails, it provides an informative error message. No data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies or unusual behaviors observed. The fallback class only raises an ImportError with a message directing users to a forked repository.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import 'Sampler' from the 'ptemcee' package as 'PTSampler'. If the import fails, it defines a class 'PTSampler' that raises an ImportError with instructions. No executable or dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code serves as a compatibility or fallback layer, providing user guidance if the required package is missing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import wrapper with a custom error message for missing dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose is to ensure the user is aware of the need to install a specific forked package. No indicators of malware or security concerns.",
