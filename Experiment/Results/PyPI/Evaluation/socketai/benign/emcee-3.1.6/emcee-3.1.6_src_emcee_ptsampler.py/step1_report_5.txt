{
  "purpose": "Provide a wrapper for importing the 'ptemcee' package's PTSampler class, with a fallback error message if not installed.",
  "sources": "The code attempts to import 'Sampler' from 'ptemcee'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; the flow is the attempt to import and fallback to raising an error if not installed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the fallback class only raises an ImportError with a descriptive message.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import 'Sampler' from 'ptemcee'. If the import fails, it defines a dummy class 'PTSampler' that raises an ImportError with instructions to install the correct package. The '__all__' variable exposes 'PTSampler' for external use. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is simple, intended for dependency management, and contains no malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a dependency wrapper and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard pattern for handling optional dependencies with user guidance. No security risks are present.",
