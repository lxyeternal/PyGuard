  "purpose": "Define a wrapper class for importing 'ptemcee' sampler, providing an informative error message if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'ptemcee' module, class instantiation in case of import failure.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import attempt -> fallback class definition with error message.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for optional dependency; no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import the 'Sampler' class from the 'ptemcee' package. If the import fails, it defines a placeholder class that raises an ImportError with a message guiding the user to install the correct package. This is a common pattern for optional dependencies and does not involve any malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code is straightforward and primarily aimed at providing user guidance when dependencies are missing.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple dependency check with user guidance on missing packages. No suspicious or malicious intent is evident.",
