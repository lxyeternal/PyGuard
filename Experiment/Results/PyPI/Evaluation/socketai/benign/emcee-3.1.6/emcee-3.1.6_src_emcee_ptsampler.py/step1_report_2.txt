  "purpose": "Defines a wrapper for importing the PTSampler class from the ptemcee package, with an informative error if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from ptemcee import Sampler as PTSampler'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted data or external commands",
  "flows": "Attempt to import ptemcee.Sampler; if unavailable, define a class that raises an ImportError when instantiated",
  "anomalies": "The fallback class solely raises an ImportError with an informative message, no malicious or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a class from an external package and provides a custom class if the import fails. The fallback class only raises an exception with a message directing users to install a different package. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is minimal and straightforward, focusing on import management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import wrapper with no malicious intent. It includes an informative error message guiding the user to install a forked version of a package if needed. No security risks or malware are present.",
