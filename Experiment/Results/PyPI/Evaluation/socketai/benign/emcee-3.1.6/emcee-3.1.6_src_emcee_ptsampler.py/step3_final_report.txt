  "flows": "Import attempt → failure triggers fallback class definition → fallback class raises ImportError upon instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import fallback pattern. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'Sampler' from 'ptemcee'. If unavailable, it defines a class 'PTSampler' that raises an ImportError with instructions to install a forked version. The pattern is standard for optional dependencies. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The fallback class only raises an error with a clear message, serving as user guidance. The code is simple, transparent, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency wrapper with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify its purpose and lack of suspicious behavior. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
