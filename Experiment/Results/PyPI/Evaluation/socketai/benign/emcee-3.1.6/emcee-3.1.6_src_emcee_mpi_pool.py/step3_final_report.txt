  "purpose": "Handle optional dependency import for MPIPool from schwimmbad, providing an informative error if not installed.",
  "sources": "Attempted import of MPIPool from schwimmbad; fallback class raises ImportError with message.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import attempt → fallback class instantiation → error raising if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dependency management pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import MPIPool; if unsuccessful, defines a class that raises an ImportError with instructions. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The pattern is standard for optional dependencies, with no data leaks or system modifications. The error message is informative, and the code is simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency handler with no malicious intent or security issues. It correctly manages missing dependencies and provides clear guidance. No risks or malware are present.",
