{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import MPIPool from the schwimmbad package and provides a fallback class that raises an ImportError with instructions if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "The import statement for schwimmbad.MPIPool and the class definition that raises an error.",
  "sinks": "The ImportError message is generated if the import fails, but it only provides instructions; it does not leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The source is the import attempt; if unsuccessful, the fallback class raises an error with a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the fallback class simply raises an informative error without any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it tries to import a specific class from a third-party library. If the import fails, it defines a class that raises an ImportError with a helpful message directing users to install the correct package. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The only behavior is conditional error raising, which is common in optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a dependency check and error messaging for missing a required package. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The fallback class only raises an error with an informational message. Overall, it appears benign.",
