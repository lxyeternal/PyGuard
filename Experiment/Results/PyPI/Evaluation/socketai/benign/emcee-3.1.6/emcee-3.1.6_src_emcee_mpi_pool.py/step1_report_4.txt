{
  "purpose": "To provide a conditional import mechanism for the MPIPool class from the schwimmbad package, with an informative error message if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'schwimmbad', and the class definition of MPIPool in the except block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present. The code only manages imports and error handling.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import MPIPool from schwimmbad; if import fails, MPIPool class raises an ImportError with a message.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and typical for handling optional dependencies. No unusual or malicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import MPIPool from the schwimmbad package. If the import fails, it defines a fallback MPIPool class that raises an ImportError with instructions on how to install the required package. This pattern ensures graceful handling of missing dependencies. The code is minimal, clear, and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious elements. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple dependency handler with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It ensures users are informed about missing dependencies without executing harmful actions.",
