  "purpose": "To provide a conditional import of the MPIPool class from the schwimmbad package, raising an informative error if the package is not installed.",
  "sources": "The import statement from schwimmbad, and the class definition that raises ImportError if the import fails.",
  "sinks": "The import attempt and the exception handling, which notify the user about missing dependencies.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import MPIPool from schwimmbad -> fallback to class definition raising ImportError if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code handles missing dependencies gracefully and does not perform any suspicious or unusual actions.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import MPIPool from schwimmbad. If unsuccessful, it defines a placeholder class that raises an ImportError with a message guiding the user to install the required package. The __all__ list indicates the module exports MPIPool. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code present. The logic is straightforward and standard for optional dependencies handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical pattern for optional dependency management with user guidance. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
