{
  "purpose": "To conditionally import the MPIPool class from the schwimmbad package, providing a clear error message if not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'schwimmbad' module and the custom MPIPool class that raises ImportError.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or execution. The code primarily handles import errors.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import MPIPool; if unavailable, the custom MPIPool raises ImportError with a message guiding installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code intentionally defines a fallback class that raises an ImportError with a detailed message, which is standard practice for missing dependencies; no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'MPIPool' from 'schwimmbad'. If the import fails, it defines a class 'MPIPool' that raises an ImportError with a message pointing users to the correct package location. This is a typical pattern for handling optional dependencies and does not involve any malicious behavior. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The code structure is straightforward and clearly documented.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign dependency management pattern, providing a user-friendly error message if a required package is missing. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this snippet.",
