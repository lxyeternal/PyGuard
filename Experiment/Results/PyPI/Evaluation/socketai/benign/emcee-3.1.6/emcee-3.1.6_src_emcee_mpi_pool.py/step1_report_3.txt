  "purpose": "To provide a fallback class for MPIPool if the 'schwimmbad' package is not installed, guiding users to install the required package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'schwimmbad' module",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "Import attempt flows into class definition; fallback class raises ImportError with message",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to handle missing dependency is standard; no unusual code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import MPIPool from schwimmbad. If unavailable, it defines a class that raises an ImportError with a clear message guiding users to install the correct package. The code structure is simple, with no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected. The purpose appears to be to manage dependency loading gracefully.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a dependency check and user guidance mechanism without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for optional dependencies, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
