{
  "purpose": "Define a class representing the state during an MCMC run, encapsulating position, log probability, blobs, and random state.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ (coords, log_prob, blobs, random_state), attributes of objects passed to __init__.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not write to files, send data over networks, or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are deep-copied or converted and assigned to object attributes; no data flows from external sources to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for managing MCMC state, with typical deep copying for safety, standard attribute handling, and iteration mechanisms. No code appears to perform any data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious behavior. Usage of numpy and deepcopy is standard for such applications. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a state container for MCMC processes. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activity.",
