  "purpose": "This code serves as the initialization and metadata module for the 'emcee' Python package, providing package info, imports, and export definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata variables (__bibtex__, __uri__, __author__, __email__, __license__, __description__), imports version info from .emcee_version, and imports submodules autocorr, backends, moves, ensemble, state.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or input sinks are present; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "flows": "The code imports version info and submodules, then defines __all__ for exports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package __init__.py file, containing metadata, imports, and export definitions. It references a reputable paper and author, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious constructs support a benign assessment. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data processing are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, benign, and free of malicious intent. The absence of detailed reports or findings suggests no security issues. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, reflecting a safe and standard package component.",
