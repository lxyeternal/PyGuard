{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for computing the autocorrelation function and integrated autocorrelation time of a 1D or multi-dimensional time series, primarily for statistical analysis in Monte Carlo or similar simulations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the input parameter `x` in functions `function_1d` and `integrated_time`. No other external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that send data externally. The code does not perform network operations, file writes, or other data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameters `x` into internal calculations via numpy operations. Results like autocorrelation estimates are returned without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code uses standard numpy and Python features. No malicious behavior or hidden functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical operations for autocorrelation and autocorrelation time estimation. It includes numpy FFT-based autocorrelation calculation, windowing, and convergence checks. No external communication, data leaks, or malicious manipulations are present. Exception handling is used for reporting short chains. The structure and logic are typical for scientific computing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate statistical analysis utility for autocorrelation in time series data. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage was found. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful actions. The code is safe and suitable for use in scientific applications.",
