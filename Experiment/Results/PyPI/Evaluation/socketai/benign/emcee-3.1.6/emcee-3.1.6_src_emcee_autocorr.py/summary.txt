  "conclusion": "The code is a trustworthy, standard implementation for autocorrelation analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior. The overall security posture is very good, and no modifications are necessary."
