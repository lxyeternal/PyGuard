{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for estimating the autocorrelation function and integrated autocorrelation time of a 1D or multi-dimensional time series, primarily for statistical analysis in Monte Carlo simulations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays passed as arguments to functions like 'function_1d' and 'integrated_time'. It uses data from these arrays for processing.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in the code. There are no untrusted data outputs or external system interactions based on input data. The only potential effect is returning computed statistical measures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input numpy arrays through calculations involving FFTs, cumulative sums, and window functions, resulting in autocorrelation estimates or autocorrelation times. There are no external data transmissions or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code solely performs numerical calculations. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. Logging is used for warnings but does not pose security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and defines functions for autocorrelation analysis. The main functions compute the autocorrelation function using FFT, then estimate the integrated autocorrelation time with an iterative windowing procedure. Error handling is via a custom exception class. There are no external data leaks, network operations, or suspicious patterns. The functions are typical for statistical analysis and do not contain any malicious code or sabotage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and designed for statistical autocorrelation analysis. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for scientific computation with standard library usage.",
