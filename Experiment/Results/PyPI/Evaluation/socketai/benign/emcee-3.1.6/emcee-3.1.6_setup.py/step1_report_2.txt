  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'emcee' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (__author__, __email__, __uri__, __license__, __description__) from src/emcee/__init__.py; reading README.rst for long description; user input sources are limited to package files and environment.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() function with metadata and configuration, writing version info to src/emcee/emcee_version.py.",
  "flows": "Reading metadata and description files -> passing data to setup() parameters -> writing version info to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network activity or data exfiltration. The code follows standard setup.py practices.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads metadata from package files and configures the package setup via setuptools. It does not include any user input processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. All file reads are limited to project files. The setup parameters are straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no external commands executed unsafely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It only reads local files for package metadata and writes version info to a designated file. There are no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
