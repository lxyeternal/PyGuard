  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script as a setup configuration, reading metadata from __init__.py and other files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows or untrusted code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code. It’s a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the standard nature of the script.\n- No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, confirms the script is typical and benign.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments; describes the script as straightforward.\n- No suspicious patterns or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None detected. The script performs typical package setup operations: reading metadata, dependencies, and invoking setuptools. No code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, uses standard regex and file reads, no obfuscation patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior, a risk score of **0** is justified.\n- **Malware Score:** Since no malicious activity is evident, malware score should be **0**.\n- **Confidence Level:** High, as all reports agree and the code is standard.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
