  "purpose": "Implementation of a logistic regression classifier for binary classification tasks with support for regularization, minibatch training, and progress printing.",
  "sources": "Inputs are received via method parameters, notably X and y in _fit, and X in predict_proba and _predict methods.",
  "sinks": "Computed probabilities in predict_proba could be misused if exposed externally, but no data leaks or harmful outputs are directly produced by the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) flows into _fit and prediction methods; internal gradients and parameters are updated in _fit; probabilities flow out of _forward and predict_proba.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or backdoors are present. Use of random seed for reproducibility is standard. No obfuscated or overly complex code segments. No network, file, or system command interactions are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard logistic regression training and prediction routines with typical structure. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. Usage of numpy for computations and random seed for reproducibility is standard. No suspicious code flows, no data leaks, no hidden behaviors. The code appears clean and purpose-driven. The only notable aspect is that it relies solely on input data and standard mathematical operations, which are common in ML code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, well-structured implementation of logistic regression for classification tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, open-source machine learning implementation.",
