  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard logistic regression for binary classification.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Uses numpy, standard functions.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The scores are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with standard imports and class methods.  \n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, uses standard math functions.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, only a standard classifier.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.  \n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score is set at 0.1, which is low but indicates a minimal concern. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external communication, this seems reasonable. The malware score remains 0.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar standard implementation.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no external interactions, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.  \n\n**Assessment:** Same reasoning applies. The low securityRisk score is justified, given the absence of external data handling or network activity.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard logistic regression code.  \n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external connections.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. The scores are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Normal implementation with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.  \n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low securityRisk and malware scores are justified.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard logistic regression implementation with no suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. No malicious activity is detected or claimed.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which matches the straightforward code structure.  \n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified given the code's nature. No external connections, no hidden code, no secrets.  \n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — the code is a standard ML implementation with no security risks.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and justified. The code is a typical, legitimate logistic regression implementation with no malicious or obfuscation concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
