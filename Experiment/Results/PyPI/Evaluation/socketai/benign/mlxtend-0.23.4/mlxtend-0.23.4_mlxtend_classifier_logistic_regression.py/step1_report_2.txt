{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a logistic regression classifier for binary classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from time and numpy modules, class methods accessing _net_input, _sigmoid_activation, and _logit_cost functions, user-defined parameters for training and prediction.",
  "sinks": "Potential outputs include prediction probabilities and class labels; no data leaks or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through _forward and _net_input methods; gradient computations flow through _backward; parameters updated in _fit; predictions generated in _predict and predict_proba.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard mathematical functions and controlled data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of logistic regression with typical functions for training, prediction, and cost calculation. It employs common machine learning practices such as mini-batch processing, L2 regularization, and stochastic gradient descent. There are no signs of malicious behaviors like network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden code. The imports and class structure are straightforward. No unusual code constructs, obfuscated segments, or suspicious external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of logistic regression without any malicious intent. It functions as a standard classifier module and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
