  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard logistic regression implementation with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and should be maintained. The code poses no security concerns and is safe for open-source distribution."
