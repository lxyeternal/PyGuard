  "purpose": "Implementation of a standard logistic regression classifier for binary classification tasks, with typical parameters for training and prediction.",
  "sources": "Input features X, target labels y, and internal parameters during training; no external data sources or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Model parameters (weights and bias) updated during training; predictions generated via sigmoid activation; no data exfiltration or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from X and y into training routines; model parameters are updated via gradient descent; predictions flow from model outputs to final classification decisions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external connections detected. Code uses standard numpy operations and class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of logistic regression with gradient descent, regularization, and cost tracking. It employs common practices without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No external network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code. Slightly elevated securityRisk scores (0.1) in some reports are conservative estimates acknowledging potential misuse if predictions are exposed externally, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard logistic regression implementation with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and should be maintained. The code poses no security concerns and is safe for open-source distribution.",
