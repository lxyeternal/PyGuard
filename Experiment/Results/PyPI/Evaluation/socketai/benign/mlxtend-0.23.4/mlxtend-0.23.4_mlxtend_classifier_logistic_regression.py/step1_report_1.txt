  "purpose": "Implementation of a logistic regression classifier for binary classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data X, target labels y, random seed for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "Model parameters w_ and b_ updated during training, outputs from _forward and predict_proba methods.",
  "flows": "Input data -> _fit method (via minibatches) -> model parameter updates -> predictions via _predict and predict_proba.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden code. The code appears straightforward, with standard logistic regression operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard logistic regression training and prediction routines, including gradient calculations, cost function, and regularization. No suspicious input/output handling, external connections, or obfuscated code patterns. Use of numpy and standard libraries, with appropriate data handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity. Random seed usage is for reproducibility only. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of logistic regression for binary classification. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
