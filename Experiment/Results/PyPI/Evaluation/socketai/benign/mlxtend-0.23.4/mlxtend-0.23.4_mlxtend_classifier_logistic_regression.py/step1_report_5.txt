  "purpose": "Implementation of a logistic regression classifier for binary classification tasks, including training, prediction, and probability estimation.",
  "sources": "Data input via method parameters such as X and y, which are standard datasets; no external or untrusted data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are predictions and probabilities returned by methods; no external data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method arguments into internal computations for training and prediction; no suspicious data flow pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of standard libraries and typical methods for logistic regression. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard logistic regression classifier with typical methods for initialization, training (_fit), prediction (_predict), and probability estimation (predict_proba). It uses numpy for numerical computations, standard Python practices, and a random seed for reproducibility. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system commands, network activity, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The methods are straightforward implementations of logistic regression algorithms, including backward propagation, cost calculation, and stochastic gradient descent. No suspicious anomalies or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, well-structured implementation of a logistic regression classifier with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on publicly available libraries and implements standard machine learning techniques.",
