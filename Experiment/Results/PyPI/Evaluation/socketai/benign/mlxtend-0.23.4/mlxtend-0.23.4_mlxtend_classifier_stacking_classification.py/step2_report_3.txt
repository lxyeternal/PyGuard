  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of a scikit-learn stacking classifier.\n- No obfuscation, external network calls, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The logic is straightforward: fitting classifiers, generating meta-features, fitting meta-classifier.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent.\n- The code relies on well-established scikit-learn practices, including cloning, label encoding, and model fitting.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the implementation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Consistent with the code.\n- **Anomalies:** None found.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable, and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly identifies the code as a typical stacking classifier.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flow is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, recognizes no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable; slightly less than perfect confidence but still aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly 1, with a slight variation in report 3 (0.95), which is reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Any necessary adjustments?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics. The code is a standard, well-implemented stacking classifier with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
