{
  "purpose": "The code implements a stacking classifier for ensemble learning, combining multiple base classifiers with a meta-classifier for improved classification performance.",
  "sources": "Inputs are the training and testing datasets (X and y), as well as optional sample weights; data is read from these variables during fit and predict_meta_features methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections or file writes are present; the code processes data in-memory for classification purposes.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit() and predict_meta_features() methods to classifier fit and predict calls; meta-features are computed from base classifier predictions and passed to the meta-classifier for training or prediction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; no unusual or hidden code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a stacking classifier with configurable options for probability-based features, feature dropping, and verbose output. It uses well-established scikit-learn patterns such as cloning estimators, fitting classifiers, encoding labels, and stacking features. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All code functionalities are consistent with typical ensemble methods, and there are no anomalies or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a stacking classifier intended for classification tasks. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, and its structure aligns with standard machine learning practices. The overall security risk score is very low.",
