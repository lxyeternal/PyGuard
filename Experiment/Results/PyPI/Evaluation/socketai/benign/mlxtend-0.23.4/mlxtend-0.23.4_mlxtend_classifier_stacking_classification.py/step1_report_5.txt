  "purpose": "Implementation of a stacking classifier for ensemble learning in scikit-learn, combining multiple classifiers with a meta-classifier for improved prediction performance.",
  "sources": "The code reads data inputs during fit and predict methods (X, y). It also reads parameters and class attributes such as classifiers, meta_classifier, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the meta-classifier's fit method, which could potentially be exploited if untrusted data is used maliciously, but this is standard for supervised learning. No network, file, or system command execution is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input features (X, y) through the fit and predict methods into classifier training and prediction, and then into meta-features generation for the meta-classifier fitting. No suspicious data flow to external systems is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. Usage of clone, warnings, and standard scikit-learn practices appears normal. No obfuscated code, self-modifying code, or suspicious imports are detected. External dependencies are standard and not suspicious. No dynamic execution or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-documented stacking classifier using scikit-learn components. It handles multiple classifiers, supports probabilistic and label-based meta features, and offers flexible configuration options. The data flow is straightforward: training data is used to fit base classifiers, generate meta-features, and then train a meta-classifier. The code includes standard checks for model fit status and adheres to scikit-learn conventions. No external network calls, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are observed. All operations are typical for a machine learning pipeline, and no malicious or sabotage-related patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a stacking classifier for classification tasks. It uses common scikit-learn techniques, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and suitable for deployment in a typical machine learning environment.",
