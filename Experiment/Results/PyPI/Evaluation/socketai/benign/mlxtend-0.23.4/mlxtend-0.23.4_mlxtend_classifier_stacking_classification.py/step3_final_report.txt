{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a scikit-learn stacking classifier for ensemble learning in classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads classifier objects, training data (X, y), and optional sample weights; uses internal methods for label encoding and classifier cloning.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network calls, or file operations; data flows are confined within model training and prediction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input features and labels into fit methods; predictions and meta-features are generated internally; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or external system interactions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a stacking classifier using scikit-learn components. It performs typical data encoding, classifier cloning, training, and meta-feature generation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flow is internal and transparent, with no external communication or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a stacking classifier with no malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to best practices and contains no suspicious patterns.",
