{
  "purpose": "The code implements a stacking classifier ensemble method for classification tasks using scikit-learn estimators.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters X and y in fit and predict_meta_features methods; accesses classifier attributes; processes model parameters and configurations.",
  "sinks": "Fitted classifiers' predict and predict_proba methods; meta-classifier's fit and predict methods; potentially outputs predictions based on input data.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) flows into fit() and predict_meta_features(), propagates through classifier fit and predict/predict_proba calls; model parameters and configurations influence fitting; predictions and meta-features flow into meta-classifier fit and predict.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures or obfuscated code; no evidence of backdoors, hidden network connections, or data exfiltration; use of warnings and cloning aligns with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a stacking classifier in scikit-learn, with comprehensive parameter handling, cloning, and fitting procedures. It does not contain code that sends data over networks, manipulates system files, or performs any malicious actions. All operations involve model training and prediction. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated constructs are present. The logic is straightforward, and the functions use well-known scikit-learn patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured ensemble classifier implementation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It serves as a tool for classification modeling using stacking techniques. There are no indications of malware or malicious behavior within this code.",
