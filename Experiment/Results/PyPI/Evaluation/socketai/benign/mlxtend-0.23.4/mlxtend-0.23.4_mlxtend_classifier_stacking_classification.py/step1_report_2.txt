{
  "purpose": "The code implements a stacking classifier for ensemble learning in scikit-learn, combining multiple base classifiers with a meta-classifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data X and target labels y during fit and predict methods; also reads classifier configurations and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that lead untrusted data to external systems or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (X, y) through fit and predict methods; classifiers' predict or predict_proba methods generate meta-features used by the meta-classifier.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls are present. No unexpected dynamic execution or misleading variable names are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a stacking classifier, using scikit-learn compatible estimators and common data flow patterns. It performs model fitting, parameter setting, and meta-feature extraction without any unusual or suspicious operations. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or code that performs unauthorized actions. The only external interactions are standard classifier methods and data processing steps, which are typical for such implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a stacking classifier without malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard patterns and libraries for ensemble methods in scikit-learn. No evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or security violations was found.",
