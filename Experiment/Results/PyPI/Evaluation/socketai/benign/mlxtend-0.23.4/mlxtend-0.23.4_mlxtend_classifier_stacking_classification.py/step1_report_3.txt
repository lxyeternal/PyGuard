{
  "purpose": "This code implements a stacking classifier for ensemble learning in scikit-learn, allowing multiple classifiers to be combined with a meta-classifier for improved predictive performance.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameters 'X' and 'y' in the 'fit' and 'predict_meta_features' methods; it also reads classifier objects from the 'classifiers' and 'meta_classifier' parameters during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows into 'fit' and 'predict_meta_features' via 'X' and 'y', and classifier predictions (probabilities or labels) are computed and stored. No external data or network communication is directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input data ('X', 'y') flows into the 'fit' method; classifiers generate predictions ('predict' or 'predict_proba') which are used to form meta-features; these meta-features flow into the meta-classifier for fitting. No external sinks or network calls are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard scikit-learn practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard stacking classifier with flexible options for probability handling, cloning, and feature augmentation. It uses common Python libraries and scikit-learn compatible methods. There are no indications of malicious data handling, network communication, or backdoors. The code primarily performs data transformations and model fitting/prediction. It includes warnings and input validation but nothing that suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation of a stacking classifier for scikit-learn with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to standard design patterns without suspicious or malicious code. The code's purpose is to improve classification performance through ensemble learning, and there are no detected security concerns.",
