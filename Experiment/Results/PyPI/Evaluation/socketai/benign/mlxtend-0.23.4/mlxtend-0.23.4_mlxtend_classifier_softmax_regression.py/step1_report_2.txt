  "purpose": "Implement a multinomial softmax regression classifier for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data X for training and prediction; target labels y for training; random_seed for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from input parameters into model computations; model weights and biases are updated during training; predictions flow from the model to output probabilities and class labels.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code uses standard numerical computations, proper data handling, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard softmax regression classifier with typical machine learning practices, including one-hot encoding, gradient-based training, and regularization. It imports time for tracking training duration and numpy for numerical operations. No suspicious or malicious constructs, hidden network calls, or obfuscation are present. The model uses random seeds for reproducibility, and all functions operate within expected behaviors. The implementation appears clean and aligns with common ML code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a multinomial logistic regression classifier. It shows no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. All functionalities align with standard practices, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
