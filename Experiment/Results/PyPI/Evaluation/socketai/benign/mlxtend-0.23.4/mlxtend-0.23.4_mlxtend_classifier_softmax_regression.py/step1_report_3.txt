{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a multinomial logistic regression classifier (Softmax regression) for multiclass classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (time, numpy); class methods and attributes; internal functions for input processing, softmax computation, cost calculation, backward propagation, training (_fit), and prediction.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through logs or print statements if enabled; no other evident sinks such as network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the method parameters (X, y) through normalization, one-hot encoding, forward pass, backward pass, parameter updates, and cost calculation within _fit. Predicted probabilities flow into the prediction methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No unusual or obfuscated code segments. The code appears straightforward and consistent with typical ML model implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard softmax regression with clear functions for input handling, softmax activation, cost computation, and gradient-based training. No external network calls, file I/O, or hidden backdoors are present. Random seed is used for reproducibility, but no sensitive data handling or insecure practices are evident. The commented code and structure are typical of a well-documented open-source ML library. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a multinomial logistic regression classifier, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It follows standard practices, and the logic aligns with typical ML model training routines. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
