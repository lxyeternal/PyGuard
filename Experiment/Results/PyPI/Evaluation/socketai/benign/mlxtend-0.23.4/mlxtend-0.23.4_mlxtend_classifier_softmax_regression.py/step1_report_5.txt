  "purpose": "Implementation of a softmax regression classifier for multi-class classification tasks, including training, prediction, and regularization.",
  "sources": "Reading input data in methods like _fit, _forward, predict_proba, and _backward; reading target labels y in _fit.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leakage or malicious actions. No network operations, file operations, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input data X and labels y are processed through _fit, passing through _forward, _backward, and _cost functions. Data flows from input to model parameters, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a machine learning model with appropriate methods and structure. Commented-out code and calculations seem normal for softmax regression.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of softmax regression with proper use of numpy for calculations. It includes methods for network input, softmax activation, cost computation, backpropagation, and parameter updates. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or external network communication. The presence of standard machine learning code and typical library imports supports its benign intent. No suspicious or malicious constructs are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a softmax classifier without any malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. It is a standard, well-structured ML component.",
