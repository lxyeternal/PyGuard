{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a multinomial logistic regression classifier (Softmax Regression) for machine learning tasks, including training, prediction, and regularization.",
  "sources": "Inputs include data passed to methods like _fit, predict_proba, and _backward; data is processed internally for training and prediction.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include probability predictions from predict_proba, and internal parameters (weights and biases) which could be accessed or manipulated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X through net input calculation, softmax activation, and loss computation; parameters are updated during training; predictions are generated via probability outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Use of random seed for reproducibility is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard multinomial logistic regression classifier with methods for forward pass, backward gradient calculation, and training loop. It uses common practices like softmax activation, cross-entropy loss, and L2 regularization. No signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not access or modify system files, environment variables, or perform any unsafe operations. The only potential concern is the handling of weights and biases, but this is typical for machine learning models. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a softmax classifier without any malicious or suspicious elements. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. It functions as intended for machine learning tasks.",
