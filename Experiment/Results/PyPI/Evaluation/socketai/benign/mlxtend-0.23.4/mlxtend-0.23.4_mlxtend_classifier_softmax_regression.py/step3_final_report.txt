  "purpose": "Implementation of multinomial logistic regression (softmax regression) for classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Input features X, target labels y, internal parameters w_ and b_ during training, data shuffling and minibatch sampling.",
  "sinks": "Predicted probabilities via predict_proba; class label predictions via _predict.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through _net_input, then to _softmax_activation, producing output probabilities; during training, gradients flow from backward method to parameter updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, external network or file system access, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of multinomial logistic regression using numpy. It includes typical methods for forward pass, backward gradient calculation, cost evaluation, and parameter updates with regularization. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose aligns with common ML practices, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of multinomial logistic regression with no malicious or obfuscation concerns. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the detailed reviews.",
