  "purpose": "Implementation of the ADAptive LInear NEuron (Adaline) classifier for binary classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from time and numpy libraries, and internal method calls such as _check_target_array, _init_params, _yield_minibatches_idx, _print_progress, _sum_squared_error_cost, and _normal_equation.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or manipulations could occur in methods using random number generators (e.g., _yield_minibatches_idx with a random seed), but these are for stochastic optimization, not malicious data leaks. No network, file I/O, or system command calls are present that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X and target y into model fitting functions, with internal calculations for weights, bias, and cost. The model parameters are updated internally during training without external influence. No untrusted data is sent externally or stored insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. Use of numpy for mathematical operations, straightforward gradient descent, and normal equations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of the Adaline classifier with options for batch, mini-batch, and stochastic gradient descent, as well as a normal equation solution. It includes progress printing controlled by a parameter and handles binary classification with labels {0, 1}. No network or system calls suggest malicious activity. Random seed controls reproducibility, not malicious randomness. The methods are typical for this kind of model, with no signs of malicious code or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of the Adaline classifier with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs common machine learning techniques and standard Python libraries, with no suspicious behavior or external malicious interactions.",
