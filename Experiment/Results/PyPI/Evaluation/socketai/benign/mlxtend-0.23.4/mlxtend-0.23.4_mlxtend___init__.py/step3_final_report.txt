  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata, including author information, license, and version number, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only comments and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code is purely metadata.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward comments and a variable assignment with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a version string assignment, indicating it is metadata for a package. No functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no executable or malicious content. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
