{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for stacking classifiers, handling prediction, probability estimation, and decision functions by combining features and ensuring the model is fitted.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data `X` for prediction functions and checks model attributes with `check_is_fitted`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not perform network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input `X` flows into prediction methods, which verify model fit and pass data to `predict`, `predict_proba`, or `decision_function` of the meta classifier, possibly concatenating features.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical sklearn-style stacking classifier base class, performing feature stacking and model validation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses common libraries, handles sparse and dense data appropriately, and delegates predictions to a meta classifier. No network calls, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The code's structure and dependencies are standard for ML pipelines, and the methods perform expected tasks with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a stacking classifier base class with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis and the reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
