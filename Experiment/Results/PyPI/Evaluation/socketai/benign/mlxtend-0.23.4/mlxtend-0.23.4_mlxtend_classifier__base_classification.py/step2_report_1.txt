  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard sklearn-like stacking classifier base class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The analysis confirms that the code is typical, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or malware indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. These are appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard stacking classifier code, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The analysis confirms standard library usage and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. These are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is described as a typical sklearn-style stacking classifier, with no signs of malicious activity. The analysis emphasizes the absence of network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0. Justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern: standard implementation, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The reasoning aligns with the scores.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also describes a typical sklearn-style stacking classifier with no suspicious features or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard implementation of a stacking classifier base class. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough, consistent, and justified. There are no indications of supply chain security issues or malicious intent in this code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe based on the provided analysis.\n\n**End of review.**",
