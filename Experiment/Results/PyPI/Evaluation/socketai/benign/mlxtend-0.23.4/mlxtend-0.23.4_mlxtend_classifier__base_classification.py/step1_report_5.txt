{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for stacking classifiers, implementing prediction, probability estimation, and decision function methods for ensemble models.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy, scipy, sklearn, and an internal estimator check function.",
  "sinks": "Method calls like 'predict', 'predict_proba', 'decision_function', and 'check_is_fitted' are used to process input data.",
  "flows": "Input data (X) is passed through 'check_is_fitted' to verify model state, then into '_do_predict' which combines features and applies prediction functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of standard scientific libraries and a typical class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a stacking classifier base class. It employs common patterns such as checking model fit state, handling sparse and dense data, and combining features for meta-model prediction. No obfuscated language features, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling or external network connections. The methods are straightforward and use well-known library functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component of a machine learning pipeline with no malicious intent. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indicators.",
