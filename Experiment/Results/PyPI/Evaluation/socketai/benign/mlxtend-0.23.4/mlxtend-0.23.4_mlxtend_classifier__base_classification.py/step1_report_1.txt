{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for stacking classifiers that combine multiple models for prediction and probability estimation.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, scipy.sparse, and a check_is_fitted function; uses class attributes such as self.meta_clf_ and self.use_features_in_secondary; calls self.predict_meta_features.",
  "sinks": "Calls to self.meta_clf_.predict, self.meta_clf_.predict_proba, self.meta_clf_.decision_function; data returned by these methods are used in prediction functions.",
  "flows": "Input data X is processed and combined with meta features, then passed to prediction functions of the meta classifier.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. Usage of external libraries is standard. The check_is_fitted usage is typical for scikit-learn estimators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard sklearn-like classifier base class for stacking models. It performs data checks, combines features conditionally, and calls meta classifier methods. No unusual patterns, no suspicious data handling or code execution. Import statements and method implementations are consistent with typical machine learning practices. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a stacking classifier base class, with no malicious behavior detected. It uses standard libraries and methods consistent with machine learning workflows. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
