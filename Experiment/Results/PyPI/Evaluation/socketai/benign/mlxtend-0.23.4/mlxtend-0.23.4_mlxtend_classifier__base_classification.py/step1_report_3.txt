{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for stacking classifiers used in ensemble machine learning models, providing prediction, probability, and decision function methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy, scipy.sparse, sklearn.base, and internal estimator check functions; class methods accessing self attributes and external functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external predict, predict_proba, and decision_function methods; check_is_fitted function.",
  "flows": "Input data (X) flows through _do_predict to predict_fn, which are methods of meta_clf_, after combining with features if needed; check_is_fitted verifies model readiness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors observed. External dependencies are standard machine learning libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a stacking classifier base class in Python, utilizing sklearn conventions. It verifies that the classifier is fitted before prediction, combines features with sparse or dense data, and delegates to internal predict functions. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, or malicious constructs detected. The code relies on standard libraries and functions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a stacking classifier base class, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It uses common practices and dependencies typical for machine learning models.",
