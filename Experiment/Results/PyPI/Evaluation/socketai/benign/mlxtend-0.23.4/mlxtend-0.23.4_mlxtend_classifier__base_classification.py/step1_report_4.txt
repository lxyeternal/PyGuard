{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for stacking classifiers, implementing prediction, probability, and decision functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn) and internal module 'estimator_checks'. No input data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications are present. No untrusted data handling beyond standard predictions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through prediction functions which call '_do_predict', aggregating features and calling the underlying classifier's methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Usage of standard libraries and clear class design.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard machine learning libraries and defines a class for ensemble stacking. It uses 'check_is_fitted' to verify model state before predictions. The '_do_predict' method handles feature stacking with sparse or dense inputs, then calls the predictor. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic is observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated elements are present. The code appears to be standard implementation of a classifier wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical machine learning model wrapper for stacking classifiers with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard practices and external library functions without suspicious or malicious logic.",
