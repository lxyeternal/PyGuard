{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for stacking classifiers in machine learning, providing methods for prediction, probability estimation, and decision scoring.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, scipy, sklearn, and internal estimator checks; class methods that access attributes such as self.meta_clf_ and self.clfs_.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to predict, predict_proba, and decision_function on self.meta_clf_ which is assumed to be a classifier object; data passed into _do_predict, which applies stacking logic.",
  "flows": "Data from input X flows into _do_predict, where features are combined with meta features or sparse matrices, then passed into prediction methods of self.meta_clf_.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. Use of internal sklearn functions and sparse handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common scientific computing libraries and defines a class with methods for prediction tasks typical in ensemble classifiers. The _do_predict method conditionally concatenates feature matrices or sparse matrices before passing them to the classifier's predict functions, which is standard in stacking models. The predict, predict_proba, and decision_function methods verify model fit and delegate to _do_predict with the appropriate function. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration. The code appears well-structured and typical of a machine learning pipeline component.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a stacking classifier base class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs predictable operations related to model prediction workflows, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
