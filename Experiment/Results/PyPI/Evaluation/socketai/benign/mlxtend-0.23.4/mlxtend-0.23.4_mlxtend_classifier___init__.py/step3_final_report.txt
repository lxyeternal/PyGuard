{
  "purpose": "This module imports various classifier classes for a machine learning library extension and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module files such as adaline, ensemble_vote, logistic_regression, etc.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes from local modules and makes them available for external use; no data flow from untrusted sources is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py style module that imports several classifier classes and defines __all__ for export. No security issues, malicious code, or obfuscation are evident. The reports provided are empty and contain no claims or findings. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The code appears benign and standard for a Python package's API surface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The empty reports support a conclusion of no issues. All scores are set to zero, reflecting a safe and straightforward module.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
