{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the OneR (One Rule) classifier for supervised learning, used for categorizing data based on a single feature.",
  "sources": "Reads input data `X` (training features and test features) and target labels `y` from function arguments during fit and predict methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses `np.bincount`, `np.unique`, and `np.argmax` for internal computations. No data is sent over networks or written to files. No external system calls or shell commands are present.",
  "flows": "Reads data in `fit` and `predict` methods, processes data to find the best feature and rules, and applies these rules to classify new data points. No external data or untrusted input is passed to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard scikit-learn compatible logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. The warnings about non-categorical features are standard. No backdoors, system modifications, or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple, interpretable rule-based classifier relying on feature error minimization and optionally chi-squared tests for tie-breaking. It only uses benign numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn functions. No network operations, system modifications, or external data leaks are present. The code does not execute dynamic code, nor does it contain hidden or suspicious logic. The warnings about non-categorical features are benign and typical for such algorithms. Overall, the implementation aligns with expected behavior for a scikit-learn compatible classifier, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the OneR classifier with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs typical data processing for model fitting and prediction. No malicious code or security risks are detected.",
