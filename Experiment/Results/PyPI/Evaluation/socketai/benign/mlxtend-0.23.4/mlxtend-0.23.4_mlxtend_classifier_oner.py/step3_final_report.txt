{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the OneR (One Rule) classifier for simple rule-based classification tasks, analyzing features and selecting the best based on error minimization and optional chi-squared tie-breaking.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (X and y), evaluates feature values, and computes class counts for rule creation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or file I/O; all processing is local in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through feature evaluation, error counting, and rule assignment, culminating in predictions based on learned rules.",
  "anomalies": "Logical flaw where the best feature selection occurs inside the feature loop, causing it to select the last evaluated feature rather than the globally best; the initial feature check with a break statement only inspects the first feature, which may be unintended but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a simple classifier with standard libraries. The primary concern is the placement of the feature selection logic inside the feature loop, which prevents correct global selection of the best feature. This flaw can lead to suboptimal model performance but does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, external system calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The warnings about non-categorical features are benign. Overall, the code is benign but has a correctness bug affecting model accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of the OneR classifier with a logical flaw in feature selection. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk is negligible, but correctness could be compromised unless the feature selection logic is corrected. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
