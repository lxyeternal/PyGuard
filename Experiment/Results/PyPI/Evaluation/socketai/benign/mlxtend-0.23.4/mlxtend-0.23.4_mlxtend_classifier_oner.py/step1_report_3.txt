  "purpose": "Implementation of a simple rule-based classifier (OneR) for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data from the parameters X (features) and y (target labels).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external locations, send data over networks, or handle sensitive information explicitly.",
  "flows": "Input features are analyzed to determine the best feature for classification based on error or chi-squared test; predictions are made by applying learned rules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. No external network activity or system manipulation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward classifier following the OneR algorithm, with methods to fit training data and predict labels. It performs feature analysis to select the most predictive feature based on error minimization or statistical tests, then applies the learned rule to classify new data. The code contains standard warnings about feature data quality, but no indication of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. No external data leaks, network operations, or insecure behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a simple machine learning classifier with no malicious behavior detected. It is safe for use, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
