  "purpose": "Implementation of the OneR (One Rule) classifier for supervised learning classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through the fit() method (X and y), which are the training features and labels.",
  "sinks": "Outputs predictions via the predict() method; no evidence of data leakage or untrusted data sinks. No network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from fit() input to internal model parameters; predictions flow from predict() output based on stored rules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious operations detected. Usage of warnings.warn() for feature checks is standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a machine learning classifier based on the OneR algorithm. It loads input data in fit(), computes class distributions and errors for features, and optionally performs a chi-squared test for tie-breaking. The predict() method applies learned rules for classification. All operations are typical for a classification model, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No network activity, file manipulation, or system commands are present. The code primarily processes data in-memory for training and prediction. It does not include any hidden or suspicious code fragments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of the OneR classifier with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It only performs data processing for machine learning purposes and does not include any malicious behavior or sabotage.",
