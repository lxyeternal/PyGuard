  "purpose": "Implementation of the OneR (One Rule) classification algorithm for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through the fit() and predict() methods, specifically X (features) and y (labels).",
  "sinks": "Outputs predicted labels in the predict() method. No other data sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit() into internal data structures; prediction rules are generated and stored; predict() applies rules to input features to generate output labels.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors observed. The code uses standard Python libraries and scikit-learn conventions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of the OneR classifier, which determines the most predictive feature based on error or chi-squared test, then applies simple rule-based classification. It only processes data provided via fit() and predict(), with no network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration routines. The class uses numpy, scipy, and sklearn libraries, all standard for machine learning tasks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The structure and logic are typical for a machine learning classifier, and no suspicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a simple classification algorithm with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It operates solely on input data to produce predictions, following typical ML practices without any hidden or malicious behaviors.",
