  "purpose": "Implementation of a scikit-learn compatible ensemble voting classifier that combines multiple base classifiers using hard or soft voting methods.",
  "sources": "Imports of external libraries (`warnings`, `numpy`, `sklearn.base`, `sklearn.exceptions`, `sklearn.preprocessing`, `..externals.name_estimators`) and class methods that utilize input data (X, y).",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code performs typical machine learning model fitting and prediction, with no direct data leaks or external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) flows into classifiers during fit; predictions flow from classifiers during predict and predict_proba; predictions are aggregated for voting; class labels are transformed via label encoder.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are evident. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden network connections are present. The code appears standard for an ensemble classifier implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class `EnsembleVoteClassifier` that manages multiple classifiers for ensemble voting. It supports both hard and soft voting schemes, allows for classifier cloning, and manages parameters for flexible integration with scikit-learn workflows. The methods perform model fitting, prediction, probability estimation, and parameter retrieval. All data flows involve typical ML processes: input data fed into classifiers, predictions obtained, and votes aggregated. No external or malicious data handling is evident. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network operations, system calls, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an ensemble voting classifier for scikit-learn. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment. It appears safe and intended solely for machine learning model ensembling.",
