{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a scikit-learn compatible ensemble voting classifier for combining multiple classifiers via hard or soft voting.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for fit, predict, and predict_proba methods; internal classifier calls; label encoding.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or malicious data handling; standard ML data flow.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into classifiers during fit and predict; predictions are aggregated via voting or probability averaging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an ensemble voting classifier compatible with scikit-learn. It uses typical data flows, classifier cloning, label encoding, and prediction aggregation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of an ensemble voting classifier with no malicious or security issues. The malware and obfuscation scores are correct at 0. The security risk score should be 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
