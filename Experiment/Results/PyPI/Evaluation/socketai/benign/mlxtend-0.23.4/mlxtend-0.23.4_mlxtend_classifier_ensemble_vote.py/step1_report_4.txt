  "purpose": "Implement a scikit-learn compatible ensemble voting classifier supporting hard and soft voting methods, with options for cloning classifiers, weighting, and fitting strategies.",
  "sources": "Imports (warnings, numpy, sklearn modules, internal name_estimators), class attributes, fit method (training data), predict methods, internal classifier clones.",
  "sinks": "predict and predict_proba methods (output of predictions), internal classifier fit calls, potential data leakage via fit data, and class label encoding.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit to classifier clone or original, through fit, predicting probabilities or classes, with the output using label encodings; no external untrusted data sources or network communications are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of standard sklearn and numpy functions with proper structure. No obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a voting ensemble classifier compatible with scikit-learn. It clones classifiers, fits them on data, predicts labels, and combines their outputs with optional weighting. It uses label encoding for classes and offers soft and hard voting options. The code is well-structured, employs common ML practices, and does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. Usage of external dependencies like 'name_estimators' appears to be legitimate. Overall, the implementation appears to be a standard, benign ML component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ensemble voting classifier for scikit-learn with no indications of malicious or sabotage behaviors. It follows standard patterns, uses common libraries, and lacks any suspicious or malicious features. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
