{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron classifier using TensorFlow and NumPy for training on labeled data.",
  "sources": "Imports from time, numpy, scipy.special, and internal modules; class methods that perform data processing, training, and prediction.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output through predictions; internal weight and bias updates; no explicit data exfiltration or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input features X through feedforward neural network layers to produce predictions; during training, gradients flow backward to update weights and biases.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or backdoors. Use of standard ML techniques; no obfuscated code or misleading variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard multi-layer perceptron classifier with backpropagation for training. It includes typical elements such as weight initialization, forward pass, backpropagation, regularization, and learning rate adjustments. No code appears to perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The class structure and methods focus solely on model training and prediction. Usage of numpy, scipy, and time modules is appropriate for the described functionality. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or hidden backdoors. The only minor concern might be the absence of input validation for parameters, but that is standard for such implementations and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a neural network classifier with no suspicious or malicious components. It appears to be a legitimate, open-source ML tool without malicious behavior or security risks.",
