  "purpose": "Implementation of a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier using TensorFlow, supporting training with backpropagation and regularization.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, scipy.special, time, and internal base classes from the package.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X through feedforward to output probabilities; gradients flow backward during training for weight updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hidden functionalities detected. Regular neural network training code, no obfuscation or hidden network communications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a neural network classifier with standard methods for initialization, training (_fit), feedforward (_feedforward), and prediction (predict_proba). It employs typical gradient-based learning with optional momentum, regularization, and minibatch support. The use of numpy and scipy for numerical computations is standard. No dynamic code execution, hidden network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The imports and class structure are typical for a neural network implementation. The overall logic and data flow are transparent and aligned with common machine learning practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a multi-layer perceptron classifier with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard neural network operations without any suspicious behaviors or hidden functionalities. The overall security risk is minimal.",
