{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron classifier for supervised learning, supporting training, prediction, and regularization features.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the method parameters such as X and y, especially in _fit and predict_proba functions; data is also accessed during the feedforward process.",
  "sinks": "Predictions are returned via _predict and predict_proba; no explicit data leaks or external data transmissions are observed; no file or network I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the parameters into the _feedforward method, which processes the data through neural network layers to produce predictions or compute costs; gradients are computed and used to update model weights during training.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code performs standard neural network training with backpropagation, regularization, and progress reporting. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a neural network classifier with configurable hyperparameters, supporting mini-batch gradient descent and regularization. It uses standard numpy operations for matrix computations, applies softmax and sigmoid activations, and implements backpropagation for training. No suspicious or malicious functions, external network calls, or data exfiltration routines are present. The use of common libraries like numpy and scipy, and standard practices in machine learning, indicates typical implementation. The only potential concern could be the use of print statements controlled by a progress flag, but this is benign and for user feedback.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a multi-layer perceptron with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard neural network training and prediction without external communications or hidden functionalities. The overall security risk is very low.",
