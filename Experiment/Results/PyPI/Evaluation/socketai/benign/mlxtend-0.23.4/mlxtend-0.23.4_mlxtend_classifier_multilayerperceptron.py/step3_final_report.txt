{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron classifier with logistic sigmoid activations, designed for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data X and target labels y, used internally in feedforward and backpropagation routines.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network calls, or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through feedforward layers to output, then backpropagated for training updates; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, backdoors, obfuscation, or external data handling. Minor unused parameter 'dropout' noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a neural network classifier using numpy and scipy, with typical training routines, regularization, and progress reporting. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. The code is clear, readable, and aligns with common ML practices. The minor unused 'dropout' parameter is benign. The security risk is minimal, justified by the absence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard multi-layer perceptron implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
