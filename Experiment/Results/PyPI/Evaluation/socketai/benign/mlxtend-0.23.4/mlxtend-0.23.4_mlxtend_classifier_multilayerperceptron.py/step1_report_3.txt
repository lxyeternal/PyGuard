{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron classifier with logistic sigmoid activations using TensorFlow, intended for supervised learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters (X, y). Reads model hyperparameters from constructor parameters. Uses numpy for computations and scipy.special.expit for sigmoid activation.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write untrusted data to external systems or perform network communications. No apparent data exfiltration or system damage code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into feedforward computations; gradients flow back during training for weight updates. No suspicious data flow outside typical neural network training process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code appears standard for a neural network implementation. Regular regularization, momentum, and dropout parameters are present but not suspicious. No obfuscated or misleading code features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a multi-layer perceptron with configurable parameters. It initializes weights, performs forward propagation, backpropagation, and updates weights accordingly. It computes cross-entropy loss with L1 and L2 regularization. The training loop shuffles data, applies minibatch gradient descent, and optionally prints progress. The use of numpy, scipy, and standard Python control flow indicates typical implementation practices. No external network calls, file operations, or hidden data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a neural network classifier with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is consistent with typical machine learning code published openly. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident.",
