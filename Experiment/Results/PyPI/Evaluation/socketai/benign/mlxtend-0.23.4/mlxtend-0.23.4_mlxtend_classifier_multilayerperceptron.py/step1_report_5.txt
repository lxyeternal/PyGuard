{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier using TensorFlow and NumPy for training and prediction tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data in the _fit() method via parameters X and y, and during prediction via the _feedforward() method; uses random seed for reproducibility; reads class labels from y.",
  "sinks": "Uses input data directly for training and prediction; no external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) flows into _fit() and predict_proba() methods; data processed through feedforward neural network calculations; model parameters (weights and biases) updated during training; no external data outputs or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures detected. The code performs standard neural network training and inference routines. Dropout parameter is accepted but not used internally, which could be considered a potential anomaly but not malicious. No obfuscated code or hidden logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Multi-layer Perceptron with backpropagation for classification tasks, supporting regularization, momentum, minibatch training, and progress reporting. It reads input data and target labels for training, computes gradients via backpropagation, updates weights and biases, and produces class probability predictions. No suspicious data leaks, external connections, or malicious logic (such as system commands, data exfiltration, or network activity) are present. The use of random seed and standard libraries further supports its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a neural network classifier with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard training and inference routines for a multi-class perceptron, without any hidden or suspicious actions.",
