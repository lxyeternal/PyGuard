{
  "purpose": "Provide server extension functionality for JupyterLab, including version management and handlers for announcements.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version, serverextension, handlers.announcements, labapp).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands. No network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly imports modules and defines functions returning configuration data; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard extension setup code with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version and handler modules, defines functions to register the server extension and app points, and references internal components like LabApp. It lacks any data processing, external network calls, or input handling. The structure is typical for a JupyterLab server extension, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for a JupyterLab server extension with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be legitimate extension configuration code.",
