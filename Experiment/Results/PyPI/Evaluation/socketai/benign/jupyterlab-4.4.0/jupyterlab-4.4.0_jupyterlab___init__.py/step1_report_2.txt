{
  "purpose": "The code provides server extension setup for JupyterLab, registering modules and handlers.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version, server extension loader, and announcement handlers; function definitions for extension paths and points.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted data or performs insecure operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The import statements and functions are standard for a plugin setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and handlers, defines functions that return configuration data for JupyterLab extension registration, and imports a module dynamically. No data is read from external sources, nor are there any operations involving untrusted input. The structure and syntax are typical for a Jupyter extension setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a JupyterLab server extension, performing standard registration functions without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
