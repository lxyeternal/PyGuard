  "purpose": "Build script for JupyterLab that cleans up static files and verifies version consistency between npm and Python components.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads (glob for files, open for JSON), subprocess call to 'hatchling version' to obtain Python version.",
  "sinks": "Deletion of .js.map files, raising ValueError on version mismatch.",
  "flows": "Filesystem globbing and deletion, JSON parsing, subprocess output to version comparison, exception raising on mismatch.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; subprocess command is fixed and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build operations: cleaning static files and verifying version consistency. It uses common libraries and practices without any network activity or malicious payloads. The subprocess call is a controlled, fixed command. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The version comparison and file deletion are typical in build scripts. No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign build utility with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores assigned are appropriate, and the overall security posture is sound.",
