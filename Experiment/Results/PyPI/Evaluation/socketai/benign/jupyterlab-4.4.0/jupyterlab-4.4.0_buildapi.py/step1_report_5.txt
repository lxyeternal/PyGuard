{
  "purpose": "The script manages building processes for a JupyterLab extension, including cleaning up files and verifying version consistency between npm and Python packages.",
  "sources": "Reads package.json to get npm version, reads files matching *.js.map, runs subprocess to get Python version.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data is written or sent externally. No code injection or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "Reads package.json -> compares npm version -> runs subprocess to get Python version -> raises error if versions mismatch.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.check_output without explicit input validation; potential risk if environment is manipulated, but in this context, it retrieves version info. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a build tool. It performs file cleanup, reads JSON data for version info, and uses subprocess to execute a version command. The subprocess call could be a concern if environment variables or command execution are compromised, but as written, it executes a fixed command to obtain the Python version. The script checks for version mismatches and raises an error accordingly. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident; the logic is straightforward and typical for build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard build utility for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The use of subprocess is limited to version retrieval, and no external data or network communication is present. It primarily ensures version consistency during build processes.",
