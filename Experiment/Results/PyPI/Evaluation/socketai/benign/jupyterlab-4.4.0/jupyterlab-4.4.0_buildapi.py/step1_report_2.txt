{
  "purpose": "The code manages build processes for a JupyterLab extension, specifically removing source map files and verifying version consistency between npm and Python components during build.",
  "sources": "Reads from filesystem (glob.glob, open), environment variables (via subprocess), and package files (package.json).",
  "sinks": "Deletes files with os.remove, executes subprocess command (hatchling version), and raises exceptions with potential message output.",
  "flows": "Reads package.json and version info, compares npm and Python versions, and may delete files or raise errors based on version mismatch.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Uses subprocess to run external command without sanitization, but this is standard in build scripts. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present. The deletion of .js.map files is standard for cleaning source maps, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a build utility for JupyterLab, handling static files and version checks. It reads configuration files and executes an external command ('hatchling version') to determine Python version, then compares it to npm version from package.json. The use of os.remove for cleaning files and subprocess for version retrieval are standard build practices. No code suggests malicious intent or sabotage. The code is straightforward, with proper exception handling in case of version mismatch.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign build utility script with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs version checks and file cleanup in a typical build process without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
