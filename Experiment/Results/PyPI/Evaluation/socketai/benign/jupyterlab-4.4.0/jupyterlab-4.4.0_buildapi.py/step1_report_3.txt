{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom build process for JupyterLab that manages static files, version consistency, and build targets.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem for specific static files (*.js.map, package.json), reads environment (via os.path.exists), and executes subprocess commands to get version info.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies or deletes static files, raises exceptions with version mismatch messages, and executes subprocess commands to retrieve version data.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and package.json -> compares versions -> may delete files -> raises exception if version mismatch",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.check_output without sanitization; no apparent malicious code, but subprocess execution could be risky if input is compromised. The code relies on specific file existence and contents, which are standard for build scripts but can be manipulated if the filesystem or external commands are maliciously altered.",
  "analysis": "The script performs filesystem operations (glob, remove files), reads JSON data from package.json, and runs an external command ('hatchling version') to get Python version info. The subprocess call could be exploited if the command or environment is compromised, but as written, it executes a fixed command without user input. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present. The code mainly manages build artifacts and checks version consistency, typical for a build script. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a standard build utility with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build script managing static files and version checks with no evidence of malicious intent. It uses subprocess and filesystem operations in a controlled manner, with no suspicious behavior or malware detected.",
