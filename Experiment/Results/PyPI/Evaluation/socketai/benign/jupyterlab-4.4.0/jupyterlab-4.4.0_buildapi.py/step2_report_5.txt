  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script performs filesystem cleanup and version verification. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Uses standard libraries and commands.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, and no issues are evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on cleaning static files and version checks. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; standard build script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—filesystem cleanup, version comparison, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; routine build process.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous, standard build utility with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are suitable.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute malicious commands. The subprocess call is standard for version retrieval and not malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the risk scores are appropriately low. They could be marginally increased if considering the use of subprocess without input validation, but since the command is fixed and controlled, the current scores are justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (or possibly 0.1, but 0.2 remains reasonable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard build utility with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2",
