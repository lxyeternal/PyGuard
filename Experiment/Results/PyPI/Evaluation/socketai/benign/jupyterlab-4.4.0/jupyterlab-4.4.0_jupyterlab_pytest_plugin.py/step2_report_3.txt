  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: fixtures for directory setup, app configuration, HTML template with JavaScript removing 'token' URL parameters, and a fetch function for HTTP requests.\n- The code is primarily for testing a JupyterLab server extension.\n- The JavaScript snippet that deletes the 'token' parameter is a standard security measure, not malicious.\n- The embedded JSON data is sanitized with 'tojson' and 'e' filters, reducing injection risks.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are detected.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), reflecting standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code does not contain malicious code or vulnerabilities. The only noteworthy action is URL token removal, which is a security best practice.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the analyses correctly identify standard practices.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  - Malware: 0 in all reports, appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, appropriate.\n  - Security risk: Very low, reflecting standard setup.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All are well below threshold; justified given the benign nature.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code inspection.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n\n- The removal of 'token' URL parameter is a security best practice, not malicious.\n- The embedded JSON is sanitized properly.\n- No suspicious external references or obfuscated code.\n- The code is for testing setup, not production or malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall assessment should be that the code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (standard setup, minor URL manipulation)  \n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign test setup for JupyterLab, with standard security practices like URL token removal. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
