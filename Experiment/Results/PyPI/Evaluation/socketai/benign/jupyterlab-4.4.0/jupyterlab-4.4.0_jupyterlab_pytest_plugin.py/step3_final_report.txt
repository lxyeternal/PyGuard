  "purpose": "Setup fixtures, directory structures, and HTML templates for testing JupyterLab server extensions, including URL parameter sanitization.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories (app_settings_dir, user_settings_dir, schemas_dir, workspaces_dir), HTML template with embedded JavaScript and JSON data.",
  "sinks": "JavaScript URL manipulation (removing 'token' parameter), rendering of JSON data into HTML, loading external scripts with sanitized variables.",
  "flows": "HTML template renders page_config data via tojson and e filters; JavaScript accesses window.location.href, modifies URL by removing 'token' parameter, and updates browser history.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard setup tasks, URL sanitization, and safe data embedding without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test setup for JupyterLab extensions, involving directory creation, configuration, and HTML rendering. The JavaScript snippet removing 'token' URL parameters is a common security measure, not malicious. JSON data is safely embedded using proper filters. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The URL token removal is a security best practice. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified given the code's benign behavior.",
