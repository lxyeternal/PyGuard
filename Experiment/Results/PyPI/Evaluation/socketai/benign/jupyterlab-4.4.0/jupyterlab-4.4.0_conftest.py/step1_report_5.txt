{
  "purpose": "The code sets up pytest configuration and command-line options for running tests, specifically for Jupyter-related testing plugins.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'parser' object for command-line arguments and accesses 'config' for pytest configuration; no external data sources are used.",
  "targets": "The code does not contain any sinks or targets that handle untrusted data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line options affects test execution flow, but no data flows to potentially malicious targets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard pytest configuration setup with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports pytest plugins, adds command-line options, and configures test markers. No code injection, data leakage, environment variable misuse, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard testing setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pytest configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages test options and markers.",
