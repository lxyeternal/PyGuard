{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define custom pytest options and configurations for running tests, specifically related to marking tests as slow or quick.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the parser object for command-line options (--quick, --slow). It also reads from the pytest configuration to modify test collection based on these options.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies test item markers to skip certain tests, which could affect test execution flow, but no untrusted data is used in a way that causes security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input options (--quick, --slow) influence the marking of test items, which determines whether certain tests are skipped or run, but this is standard behavior for test configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward test setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and registers custom command-line options for skipping or running slow tests. It modifies test collection based on user-specified flags, marking certain tests to skip accordingly. The logic is standard for test configuration and does not handle any untrusted data, nor does it execute any code based on external inputs beyond command-line flags. There is no suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical pytest configuration script that manages test execution options. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as test setup logic without any harmful side effects.",
