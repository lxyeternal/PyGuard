  "purpose": "Define pytest plugin configuration and command-line options for running and categorizing tests in a Jupyter environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from pytest plugin options and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential manipulation occurs if untrusted input affects test execution flow or triggers malicious behaviors, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line options affects test marker assignment, influencing which tests run.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. Code is straightforward plugin configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up pytest plugin options for controlling test execution, specifically 'quick' and 'slow' flags, and modifies test collection based on these options. All functions are standard plugin hooks with clear, benign purpose. No external data, no system commands, no obfuscated code, and no malicious actions are present. The code adheres to expected pytest plugin patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest plugin setup for test categorization; it contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
