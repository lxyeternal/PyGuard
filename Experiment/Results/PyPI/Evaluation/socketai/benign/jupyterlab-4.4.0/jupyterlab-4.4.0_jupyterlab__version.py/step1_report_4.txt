  "purpose": "Define version information for a Jupyter package, including metadata such as version number and release level.",
  "sources": "Constant data definitions, import statements, and version info assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user input, no data leaks, and no sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs present. The code is straightforward version info setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple' from 'collections', defines a structured version info tuple, and constructs a version string based on static version data. The version info is managed by an external tool ('bumpversion'), indicated by a comment. No dynamic or external data is processed, and there are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version definition file for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security issues. It only contains static data and straightforward string formatting, posing no security risks.",
