  "purpose": "Define and manage the version information of the package.",
  "sources": "The version_info object and the __version__ string formatting depend on static data within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present; the code only constructs a version string from constants.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the version_info data to the __version__ string via formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The versioning info is explicitly managed and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library (collections), defines a namedtuple for version info, sets a version_info instance with fixed data, and constructs a version string based on this data. No external input, user data, or dynamic code execution occurs. The version string is generated using static constants, and there are no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation for version management. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security issues. It serves its purpose of defining version information securely and clearly.",
