  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version management snippet. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code only defines static version information and formats a version string accordingly. No external data inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0, aligning with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code. The security risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNone of the reports suggest any risk level above 0.5. All scores are 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, reflecting the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's static, declarative nature. No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. The uniformity across reports supports their validity.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — The code is purely declarative, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks are present.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard version management snippet with no security concerns.**",
