{
  "purpose": "Defines static version information for a Python package, constructing a version string based on predefined version components.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version_info tuple, no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data used to generate version string without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library, defines a namedtuple for version components, assigns static version data, and constructs a version string accordingly. It includes comments indicating automated management of version info. There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is purely declarative, serving as a version metadata utility. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The logic is correct, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version management snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with its static, straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
