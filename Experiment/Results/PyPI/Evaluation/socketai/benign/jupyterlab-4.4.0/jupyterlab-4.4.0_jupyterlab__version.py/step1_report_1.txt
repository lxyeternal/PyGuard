  "purpose": "Define and manage version information for a software package, specifically Jupyter.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and variable assignments; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; static data used for version info only.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard versioning pattern, no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple' from 'collections' to define a structured version info object. It initializes version information with fixed values for major, minor, micro, release level, and serial. The '_specifier_' dictionary maps release stages to their string identifiers. The '__version__' string is assembled from these values in a straightforward manner, with no dynamic or external inputs involved. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activities are present. The code is purely declarative, managing version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. It only defines version info for a package and formats a version string.",
