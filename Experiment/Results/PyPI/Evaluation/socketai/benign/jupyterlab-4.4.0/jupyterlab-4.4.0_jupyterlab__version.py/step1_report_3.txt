  "purpose": "Define and manage version information for a Python package, specifically for Jupyter components.",
  "sources": "Constants and variable assignments, including version info and release level.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version info object, formatting version string based on internal data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated segments. The code comment suggests automated management of version info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple' to create a structured version info object. It sets the version info explicitly, with a note indicating this is managed automatically. It constructs a version string dynamically based on the version info, appending release level suffixes accordingly. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, or malicious logic present. The code appears to be standard version management logic for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version info management snippet for a Python package, with no malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It is standard package version handling code.",
