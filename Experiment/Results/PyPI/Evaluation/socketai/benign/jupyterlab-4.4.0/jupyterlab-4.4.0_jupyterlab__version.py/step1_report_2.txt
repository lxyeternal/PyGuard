  "sources": "Constants and module attributes such as version_info and __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static assignment and string formatting for version information; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. Code comments clearly indicate version management.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up versioning information using namedtuple and string formatting. It includes comments advising not to manually edit version variables. No user input, network calls, or obfuscated code. The use of standard library features and straightforward logic indicates a benign purpose. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition module for a Python package with no malicious intent. It functions solely to define and format version metadata.",
