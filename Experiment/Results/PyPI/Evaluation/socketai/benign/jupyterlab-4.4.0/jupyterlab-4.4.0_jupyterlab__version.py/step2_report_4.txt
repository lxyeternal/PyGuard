  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version management snippet.\n- No external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic behaviors are involved.\n- The code uses standard library features and clear logic.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The version info is statically assigned, with a comment indicating automated management.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The \"malware\" score assigned as 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score as 0 is justified; the code is clear and readable.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score as 0 aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n- The \"risk\" score is consistently 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and justified.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on static, declarative code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign version management snippet.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- No modifications or re-scoring are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risks present)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code snippet is a typical versioning utility with no security concerns. The scoring and analysis are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
