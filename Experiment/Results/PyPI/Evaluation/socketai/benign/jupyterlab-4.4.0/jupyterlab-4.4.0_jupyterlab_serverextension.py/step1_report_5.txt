  "purpose": "The code initializes a Jupyter server extension, configuring static resource redirects for favicon and logo images.",
  "sources": "Reads the server application's base URL and static resource paths; imports from jupyter_server.utils and tornado.web.",
  "sinks": "Uses RedirectHandler to redirect static resource URLs; relies on serverapp.base_url for URL construction.",
  "flows": "Source: serverapp.base_url and static resource paths -> sink: RedirectHandler serving constructed URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The URL paths are static and derived from server app data, with no dynamic or external inputs involved.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical extension setup for Jupyter Notebook, configuring static favicon and logo image redirects via tornado.web RedirectHandler. The URLs are constructed by joining the server's base URL with static resource paths, which are hardcoded and consistent with the application's structure. No user input or external data sources are processed in a way that could lead to code injection or data leakage. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network communications outside of redirect handling, nor does it manipulate or expose sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for static resource redirects in a Jupyter server extension. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is straightforward and aligns with normal server configuration practices.",
