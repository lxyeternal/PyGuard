  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The only additional element is a comment suggesting updating documentation or references, which is standard practice and not suspicious.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or any complex logic involved.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No report indicates any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for version management in Python packages.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or flaws are present; the code performs a simple, well-understood task.\n   - The comments are benign and serve as reminders for documentation updates.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Potential for Vulnerability or Exploitation**:\n   - Since the code is static and does not process external data or execute any logic beyond assignment, there's no attack surface here.\n   - The comments do not suggest any hidden or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency**:\n   - The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates** match the reports: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code snippet is a benign, standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
