  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of a string to __version__ variable; no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no data movement or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple, straightforward version assignment with a benign comment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, with a comment about documentation updates. No inputs, outputs, data flows, or malicious patterns are present. The code is static and typical for version declaration. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
