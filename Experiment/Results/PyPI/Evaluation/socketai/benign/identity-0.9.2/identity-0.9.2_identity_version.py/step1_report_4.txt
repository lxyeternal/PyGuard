  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple static assignment with a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages. The comment suggests a reminder to update documentation, but does not indicate any suspicious activity. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak information, and no complex flow. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
