  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for Flask authentication flows, verifying URL generation, session handling, and external configuration mocking in a controlled test environment.",
  "sources": "Request contexts, mocked external endpoints, configuration variables, and session data.",
  "sinks": "Logout URL, login URL, session storage, and redirect links.",
  "flows": "Input from request contexts and configuration flows into URL generation and session management, with no external data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard testing practices with mocks to simulate external dependencies, verifying URL correctness and session behaviors. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, test-oriented nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate test code for Flask authentication flows, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
