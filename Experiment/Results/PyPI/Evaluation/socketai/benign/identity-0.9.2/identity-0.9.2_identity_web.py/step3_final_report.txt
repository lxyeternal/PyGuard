{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication helper using MSAL, managing sessions, tokens, login/logout flows, and configuration fetching for web applications.",
  "sources": "Session storage for tokens and user info; external HTTP request to fetch OpenID configuration; input parameters for login flows and redirect URIs.",
  "sinks": "Session data updates; network requests to configuration endpoints; URL redirects for login and logout; token acquisition functions.",
  "flows": "Session reads/writes for user info and tokens; configuration fetch from well-known endpoint; login flow initiation leading to user redirection; token refresh and acquisition flow; logout URL construction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. External configuration fetch is standard but could be a risk if the endpoint is compromised; however, this is typical in OAuth/OIDC implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured OAuth2/OIDC helper utilizing MSAL and requests. It manages tokens securely, handles sessions appropriately, and performs login/logout flows as expected. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic fetch of configuration is common practice, though it introduces a dependency that could be exploited if the endpoint is compromised. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and standard security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of OAuth2/OIDC authentication helpers. It contains no malicious or sabotage elements. The low risk score reflects typical external dependency risks but does not indicate malicious intent.",
