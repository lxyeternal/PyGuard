  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, well-structured implementation of OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication helpers using MSAL and requests.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code's flow involves session management, token caching, configuration fetching, and URL redirection, all consistent with typical OAuth2/OIDC patterns.\n- No signs of malware, sabotage, or backdoors are evident.\n- The security risk scores are uniformly low (~0.2), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports match the provided code.\n- **Functionality:** The code handles login, logout, token refresh, session management, and configuration retrieval as described.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Configuration fetching:** Uses requests.get to retrieve OpenID configuration, which is standard.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No significant logical flaws are apparent. The code appears correct and follows best practices.\n- The only minor concern is reliance on external endpoints for configuration, which is standard but could be a point of attack if the endpoint is compromised. However, this is an inherent risk in OAuth/OIDC workflows, not a flaw in the code itself.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.2) but justified as standard risk in external configuration fetches, not malicious.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports mention the dynamic fetching of the OpenID configuration as a minor concern, but it's standard practice.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** Confirmed.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low (~0.2), as the code is a typical OAuth2/OIDC helper.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard external configuration fetch, no inherent vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication helper, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are—malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.",
