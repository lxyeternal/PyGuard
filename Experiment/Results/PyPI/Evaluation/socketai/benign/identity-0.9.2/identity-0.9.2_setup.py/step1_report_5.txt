  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only imports and calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs, as setup() is called with no arguments, and no untrusted data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with default arguments. It is a typical minimal setup script with no suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no input sources, data flows, or potentially dangerous sinks. The script does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or data handling beyond invoking setuptools.setup().",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup script for packaging a Python project. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
