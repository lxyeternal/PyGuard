  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code simply runs setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, only importing setuptools and calling setup() with no arguments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior is present.",
