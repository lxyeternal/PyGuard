  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with no arguments, representing a standard minimal packaging script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, data leaks, or suspicious patterns. The code does not process external input, contain hardcoded secrets, or perform any network activity. All signals indicate benign, standard usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals, including scores, are consistent with this assessment.",
