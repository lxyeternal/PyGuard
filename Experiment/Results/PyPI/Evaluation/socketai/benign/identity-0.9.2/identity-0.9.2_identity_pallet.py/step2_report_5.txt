  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Describes standard web auth helper functionality—route registration, login/logout, redirect handling, and session management. Sources and sinks are typical, with no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies**: No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. URL parsing is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: The report finds no malicious intent or vulnerabilities, noting the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment**: The code appears legitimate, with minimal security risk. The low security risk score is reasonable given the context, but since the code handles redirects and user sessions, a slight increase to 0.3 could be justified if considering potential misconfigurations outside this snippet. However, based on this isolated review, 0.2 remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Similar to Report 1, focusing on route setup and session management.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code or secrets. URL parsing and route registration are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious behavior detected; standard implementation.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent and reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Again, a standard web auth helper with route registration, login, logout, and decorators.\n- **Anomalies**: No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. URL parsing is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No signs of malicious intent; code appears standard.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment**: Valid and consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Similar structure, with focus on URL parsing, route registration, and session management.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code or secrets. URL parsing is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious activity detected; code is typical for web auth modules.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment**: Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Same pattern—route registration, URL parsing, login/logout management.\n- **Anomalies**: No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. URL parsing is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious intent or suspicious behavior; appears standard.\n- **Scores**: Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score**: Uniformly 0.2, indicating low but not zero risk. Given the code handles redirects, sessions, and URL parsing, a slightly higher score (e.g., 0.3) could be argued if considering misconfiguration or external input handling, but as per the reports' analysis, 0.2 remains reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk**: 0.2–0.3 (low risk, standard for auth modules)\n\n**My reasoned estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.2–0.3\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are consistent with the code's nature. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or high security risks. The low risk score is justified, and the absence of malware or obfuscation is correct.",
