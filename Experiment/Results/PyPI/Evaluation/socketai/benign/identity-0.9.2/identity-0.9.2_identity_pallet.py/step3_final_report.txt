  "purpose": "This code implements a web authentication helper class for Flask and Quart frameworks, managing route registration, login/logout, and session handling.",
  "sources": "URL parsing from self._redirect_uri, request object for current URL, environment variables for app configuration",
  "sinks": "Redirects via self._redirect, route handlers, session storage, and potentially untrusted URL inputs",
  "flows": "URL parsing of self._redirect_uri to determine redirect paths -> route registration -> login/logout actions -> session management",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; URL parsing from potentially untrusted input could be risky if not validated externally",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an authentication helper, with route setup, session management, and decorators for login enforcement. No suspicious data flows, code injection, or obfuscation are present. URL parsing is used for route setup, which is typical but should be validated externally to prevent open redirects. The code does not contain backdoors, malicious network activity, or hidden behaviors. The security considerations depend on external input validation, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk typical for such web auth helpers. No issues or malicious behaviors are detected.",
