{
  "purpose": "Import the __version__ variable from the local version module for version management within the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable from the local version module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process external inputs or data flows.",
  "flows": "Source is the import statement; no data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; the only comment notes cyclic dependency concerns, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module, a common pattern in Python packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The comment about cyclic dependencies indicates awareness of import issues but does not imply malicious intent. The code is minimal, clear, and serves a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
