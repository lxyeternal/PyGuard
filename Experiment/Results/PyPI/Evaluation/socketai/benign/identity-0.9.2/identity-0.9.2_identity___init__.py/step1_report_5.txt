  "purpose": "Import the package's version information from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing '__version__' from the local 'version' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows from the 'version' module to the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string or number from a local module named 'version', likely for version tracking or display purposes. The comment indicates an awareness of cyclic dependencies that could arise from mutual imports, and the code avoids such issues by importing only what is necessary. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and typical for package version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard and safe import of version information. No malicious intent, anomalies, or security risks are present.",
