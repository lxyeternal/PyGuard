  "purpose": "Importing the __version__ attribute from a local module for version tracking within the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable from the version module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is being sent, written, or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The source (__version__ in version module) is imported into the current module; no flow beyond this is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. The comment indicates awareness of cyclic dependencies, which is standard in module design.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement for the __version__ attribute from a local version module. It serves to keep track of the package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The only notable aspect is the comment about cyclic references, which is common in Python package management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and appears solely for version management. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
