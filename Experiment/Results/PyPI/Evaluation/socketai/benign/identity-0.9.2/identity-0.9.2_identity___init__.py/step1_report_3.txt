  "purpose": "Importing the package version information from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __version__ from a local module (version.py)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code comments indicate an awareness of cyclic dependencies but do not introduce suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a __version__ variable from a local module named version, which is a common practice for version management in Python packages. The comment mentions avoiding cyclic references by importing inside the module. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a simple purpose without complex control flows or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package version import with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern used in Python projects to manage versioning.",
