  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration with no malicious activity. No suspicious code, no data flows, no external network calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly notes that the code is typical for a Sphinx setup, with no malicious behavior. The import of `identity.__version__` is standard for versioning, assuming the package is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, no malicious activity detected. All static configuration, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard configuration. The sys.path modification and import are common in documentation projects.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no suspicious code or activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or code execution.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Since all code is static configuration with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is purely configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
