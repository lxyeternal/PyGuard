  "purpose": "A helper class for OAuth2/OIDC authentication flows in a Quart web application, managing login, error handling, and access control.",
  "sources": "request.args, environment variables (via comments), class/session attributes (_auth, _request, _session), external configuration and methods (_auth.log_in, _auth.complete_log_in).",
  "sinks": "render_template, redirect, calling external auth methods, URL generation with url_for.",
  "flows": "request.args and environment variables feed into auth methods; results lead to rendering templates or redirects; login_required decorator wraps view functions to enforce authentication.",
  "anomalies": "Storing request and session objects as class attributes during __init__ is unconventional and could cause issues in concurrent request handling but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard OAuth2/OIDC helper with typical patterns for login, error handling, and decorators. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of class attributes for request/session is unusual but not malicious. External dependencies and methods are assumed to be trusted. The overall structure and logic align with common practices, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard OAuth2/OIDC helper for Quart with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and security risk (~0.2) scores are justified. It is safe to consider this code benign.",
