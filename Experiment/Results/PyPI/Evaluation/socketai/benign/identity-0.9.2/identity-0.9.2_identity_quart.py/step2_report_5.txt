  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's content, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly states that the code implements an OAuth2/OIDC authentication helper for Quart, handling login, errors, and decorators.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Accurate; request.args, environment variables, render_template, redirect.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious flows or anomalies. The code relies on external configs, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent and accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard patterns, no malicious intent.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Correct; request data, environment variables, rendering, redirecting.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious flows or anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Reasonable; the code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; consistent evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion; standard auth helper.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Correct; environment variables, request args, rendering, redirect.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious flows; use of environment variables is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; no malicious indicators.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Correct; environment variables, request args, rendering, redirect.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; use of class attributes for request/session is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-reasoned; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly describes the code's purpose.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Accurate; request.args, environment variables, rendering, redirect.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious flows; standard usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; typical OAuth-like flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or supply chain risks.\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree the code is standard, relying on external configs, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.2). These are reasonable given the code.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth2/OIDC authentication helper for a Quart web app.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate, considering external configuration and standard practices.\n- The malware score should remain at 0; no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0; code is clear and readable.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**            | **0.2**  |\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
