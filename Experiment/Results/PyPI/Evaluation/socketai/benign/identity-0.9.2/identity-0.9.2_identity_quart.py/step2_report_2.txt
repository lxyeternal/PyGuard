  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential security issues, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a standard OAuth2/OIDC authentication helper for Quart, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning is sound; no suspicious code, secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The score of 0.2 for securityRisk seems reasonable given the code's reliance on external configuration and standard practices.\n- Malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, the code is a typical auth helper with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The analysis is consistent; no backdoors or malicious code.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, a standard auth helper with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's structure.\n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Same conclusion—standard implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- Consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: The code manages OAuth-like login flows, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network connections to untrusted domains, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated**: All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk**: The assigned 0.2 is reasonable, considering the code handles authentication flows and relies on external configuration. No hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, standard OAuth2/OIDC helper for Quart with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 (low, typical for web auth flows relying on external configs)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious intent. The current scores accurately reflect the analysis.",
