  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OAuth helper for Django with no malicious intent. The main security consideration is the handling of redirect_uri in _parse_redirect_uri, which could be exploited if not validated. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in risk to reflect this potential vulnerability. Ensuring redirect_uri is validated against a whitelist will mitigate open redirect risks."
