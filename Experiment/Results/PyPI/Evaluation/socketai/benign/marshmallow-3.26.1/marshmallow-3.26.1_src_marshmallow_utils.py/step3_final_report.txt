  "purpose": "Utility functions for marshmallow, including data parsing, type checking, date/time conversions, and data extraction.",
  "sources": "Functions like from_rfc, from_iso_datetime, get_value, set_value, and date/time formatting utilities that process input data, untrusted data, or external strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted input is mishandled, but functions do not perform network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., date strings, nested dicts) flows through parsing or accessor functions, with no dangerous side effects or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for data validation, parsing, and extraction. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Functions handle untrusted data safely and do not perform harmful operations. The deprecation warnings are benign and related to library evolution. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to data handling, which is inherent to such utilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard low-risk utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of utility functions for marshmallow with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scoring in the reports is accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
