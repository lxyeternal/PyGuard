{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for serialization and schema handling to avoid circular imports in a larger library.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, abc module for abstract classes, no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, no handling of untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; code only defines abstract classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and purely structural, with a deprecation warning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines two abstract base classes with abstract methods related to serialization and schema operations. There are no indications of any dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communications. The deprecation warning suggests the module is outdated and should not be used as a base for new code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, structural implementation of abstract classes for a serialization library. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The module is deprecated, and its use is discouraged, but it poses no security threat.",
