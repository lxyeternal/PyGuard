{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for schema and field objects to avoid circular imports in a larger marshmallow-like serialization framework.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources; only class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the methods are abstract and intended for subclass implementation.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly defined; the code is purely structural with no executable logic beyond method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. The module is deprecated as indicated in the warning.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes using ABC for fields and schemas, with abstract methods for serialization and deserialization. It contains no executable logic or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The warning indicates the module is deprecated and should not be used, but this does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of abstract classes without any malicious intent or security issues. Its purpose is structural and does not involve data processing or external interactions. No risks are identified.",
