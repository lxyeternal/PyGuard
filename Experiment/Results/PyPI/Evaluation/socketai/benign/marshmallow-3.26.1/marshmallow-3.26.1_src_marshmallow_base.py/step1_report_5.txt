{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for schema and field components to prevent circular imports in a larger serialization/deserialization framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, abstract method declarations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external data handling; abstract methods may be implemented elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this code fragment; it merely defines interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated warning, but no malicious or suspicious code or behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes for fields and schemas, serving as interfaces for serialization logic. It uses standard Python features like ABC, abstractmethod, and type annotations. No code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present. The deprecation warning indicates the module is outdated but not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless abstraction layer for a serialization framework. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
