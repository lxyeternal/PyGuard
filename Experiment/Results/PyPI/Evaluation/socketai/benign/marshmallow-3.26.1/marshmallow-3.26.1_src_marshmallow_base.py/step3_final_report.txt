{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes for serialization fields and schemas to avoid circular imports, serving as interface definitions in a serialization framework.",
  "sources": "Method signatures within the abstract classes, no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely class and method signature definitions without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract base classes using Python's abc module, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The deprecation warning is informational. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure constructs are present. The code's purpose is structural, serving as interfaces for subclasses. All security-related signals are absent, and the code poses no threat. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified based on the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious set of abstract classes used for defining interfaces in a serialization framework. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The deprecation notice does not impact security. The overall assessment confirms the code is safe and poses no threat.",
