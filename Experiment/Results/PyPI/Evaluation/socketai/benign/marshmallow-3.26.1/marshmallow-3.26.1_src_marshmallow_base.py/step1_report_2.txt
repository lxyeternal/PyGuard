{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for schema and field components in a serialization/deserialization framework, primarily for internal use and avoiding circular imports.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statements and class method definitions. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or output operations, no data is written or sent over network, and no untrusted data processing is performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present; the code only defines abstract methods without implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code is straightforward, with deprecation warnings noted.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of abstract base classes using Python's abc module, with abstract methods for serialization and deserialization. It includes a deprecation warning in a docstring. There are no executable statements or data handling, and no network or system interactions. The structure is simple and conventional, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The focus is on defining an interface for subclasses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard definition of abstract classes for a serialization framework, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It serves as internal API scaffolding with a clear deprecation notice. Overall, it presents no security threat.",
