  "flows": "Attribute access triggers warnings and version retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; standard warnings.",
  "analysis": "Uses __getattr__ for deprecation warnings and version info retrieval via safe standard library calls. No network activity, data processing, or external data manipulation is present. The code is straightforward, employing common patterns for deprecation notices and version handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Benign utility code for managing deprecated version attributes with standard warnings and re-exports. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are involved.",
