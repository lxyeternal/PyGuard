  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Provides deprecated version info attributes with warnings; re-exports modules/constants.\n- Sources: importlib.metadata, packaging.version, marshmallow modules.\n- Sinks: The version info returned by __getattr__.\n- Flows: Attribute access triggers warnings and version retrieval.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious or malicious code; standard warnings.\n- Analysis: Uses __getattr__ for deprecation warnings and version info retrieval via safe standard library calls.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility code; no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, handling deprecated version attributes with warnings.\n- Sources: Same as above.\n- Sinks: Version info, no external effects.\n- Flows: Attribute access triggers safe version retrieval.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern for deprecation warnings; safe use of version info.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0.0\n- Security risk: 0.0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions, attribute accessors, schema components, handling deprecated attributes.\n- Sources: Standard and third-party modules, local fields.\n- Sinks: No data leaks or external effects.\n- Flows: Attribute access triggers warnings and version info retrieval.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior; straightforward version handling and re-exports.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility module.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Dynamic attribute access for deprecated version attributes, re-exporting components.\n- Sources: Similar to above.\n- Sinks: No processing of untrusted input.\n- Flows: Attribute access leads to warnings and version info retrieval.\n- Anomalies: Standard deprecation pattern; no suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Safe, standard handling of version info; no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Deprecated attribute accessors, warnings, imports.\n- Sources: Standard library, marshmallow.\n- Sinks: Warnings issued, no data leaks.\n- Flows: Attribute access triggers warnings and version info retrieval.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Analysis: Typical deprecation handling; no external effects or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports agree that the code is primarily a utility module handling deprecated version attributes with warnings, using standard Python practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The version info retrieval is safe, and no external data or network activity is involved.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (minimal, due to deprecation warnings, which are standard practice)\n\n**Note:** Given the consistent analysis, I would keep the scores as they are or possibly lower the risk score to 0, since there's no real security concern here.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module that manages deprecated version attributes with warnings and re-exports components. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate.",
