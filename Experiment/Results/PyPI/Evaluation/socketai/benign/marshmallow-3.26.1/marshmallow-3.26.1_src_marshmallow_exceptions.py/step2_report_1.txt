  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- Defines custom exception classes for marshmallow validation errors.\n- No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- Exception messages and data are stored as attributes, used internally.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- Standard Python class inheritance and error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior; standard exception pattern.\n- Malware score: 0 (correct).\n- Risk score: 0 (appropriate, as no security risk).\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1.\n- Analysis: No external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes.\n- Analysis: No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes.\n- Analysis: No external data or malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes.\n- Analysis: Same as above, standard pattern.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code matches the description: standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The logic and implementation are correct and standard.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0 and security risk = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent?**  \n  None. The code is purely structural for error handling.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations\n\n- The **malware score** should remain **0** because there is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The **security risk score** should also be **0** for the same reasons.\n- The **obfuscated score** is correctly **0**; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **risk score** is appropriately **0**, given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.**\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate (Post-Review)\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes with no security concerns.",
