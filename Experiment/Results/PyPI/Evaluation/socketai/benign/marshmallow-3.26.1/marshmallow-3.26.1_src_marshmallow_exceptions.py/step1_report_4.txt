  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for marshmallow validation errors and schema-related errors.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializations and property methods; no external input handling or data reading.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with error messages; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Exception construction and raising propagate error messages; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes primarily for error handling within marshmallow schemas. It includes constructors for error messages and properties for message normalization. No input parsing, external data reads, or untrusted data processing occur. The exception messages are static or derived from inputs but do not indicate malicious intent or data exfiltration. The code structure is standard and does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to serve a purely functional purpose within a validation framework.",
