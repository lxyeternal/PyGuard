{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for marshmallow validation errors, serving as error handling scaffolding.",
  "sources": "Error message parameters, internal data attributes used during exception raising and handling.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows; exception messages are stored internally and not transmitted externally within this code.",
  "flows": "Error messages and data flow from exception instantiation to internal storage; no external sinks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception hierarchy, with attributes for messages, data, and schema info. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The exception messages are stored as attributes for internal use. The structure is typical for error handling modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of exception classes for marshmallow validation errors. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The malware score is 0, the security risk score is 0, and the code's clarity and purpose are straightforward.",
