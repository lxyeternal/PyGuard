{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for marshmallow-related validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; error messages and data are passed as parameters to exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and message handling are primarily local; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; exceptions are used for control flow within safe boundaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard exception classes with proper encapsulation, no external data processing or network operations. The message handling is straightforward, with no apparent manipulation of data for malicious purposes. No embedded code injection or data leakage mechanisms. The class structure and inheritance appear standard and safe. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only data handled are exception messages and internal data structures, which do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides exception classes for marshmallow validation errors without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is a standard, safe implementation for error handling.",
