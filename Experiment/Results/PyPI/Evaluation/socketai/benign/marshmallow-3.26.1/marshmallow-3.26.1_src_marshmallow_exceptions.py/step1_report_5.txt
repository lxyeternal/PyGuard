  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for marshmallow-related error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all data is from exception instantiation parameters and internal class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; no data leakage or untrusted data handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code is standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "This code solely defines exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions with no data processing, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. It uses standard Python syntax and typing. No indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely structural for error handling and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process or transmit data externally and adheres to standard coding practices.",
