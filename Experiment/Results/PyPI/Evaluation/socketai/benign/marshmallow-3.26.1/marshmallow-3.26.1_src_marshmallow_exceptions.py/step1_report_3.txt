{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for marshmallow-related error handling, primarily for validation errors and schema operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; defines exception classes and constants within the module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no functions or operations that handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external sources or sinks; exception classes are used for error handling within the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior; code appears to be standard exception class definitions without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python built-ins, with no external data handling or code execution. It includes standard error message handling, with no apparent malicious behavior or obfuscation. No input/output operations, network access, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in marshmallow validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this module.",
