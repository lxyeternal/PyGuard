  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines three custom warning classes inheriting from Python's built-in warnings. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or executable logic. The code is static and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Score Justification and Reasonableness**:  \n- **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware score (0)**: Correct, no malicious intent or behavior is present.  \n- **Security risk (0)**: Correct, the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:  \nSince the code is benign, the risk score of 0 and malware score of 0 are appropriate. The reports’ high confidence levels (mostly 1.0) are justified.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**:  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static nature of the code, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \nAll reports are consistent in their assessments and scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**The code is a simple, standard definition of custom warning classes with no malicious or security concerns. The scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.**",
