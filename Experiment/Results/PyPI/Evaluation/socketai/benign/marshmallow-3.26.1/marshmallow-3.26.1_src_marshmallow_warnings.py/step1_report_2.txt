  "purpose": "Define custom warning classes related to deprecation and changes in Marshmallow version 4.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are only subclassed warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines three subclasses of DeprecationWarning and Marshmallow4Warning. There are no data inputs, processing, or external interactions. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python warning classes. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, harmless definition of custom warning classes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
