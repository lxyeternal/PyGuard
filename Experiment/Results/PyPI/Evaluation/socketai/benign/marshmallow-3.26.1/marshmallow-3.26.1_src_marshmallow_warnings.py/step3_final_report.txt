  "purpose": "Define custom warning classes inheriting from Python's built-in warnings for categorization related to Marshmallow 4 updates.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from DeprecationWarning and Warning classes.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external interactions, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static class inheritance without data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom warnings, with no data sources, sinks, or flows. It does not perform any operations, external data handling, or dynamic execution. The code is simple, static, and serves to categorize warnings related to Marshmallow 4. Changes or malicious activity are not present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a straightforward definition of custom warning classes. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. The code poses no threat and is safe for use.",
