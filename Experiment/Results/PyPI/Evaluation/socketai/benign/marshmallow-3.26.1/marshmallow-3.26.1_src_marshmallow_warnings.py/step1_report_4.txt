{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning classes related to deprecation and changes in Marshmallow version 4.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward class inheritance without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines three custom warning classes that inherit from Python's built-in warning classes. There are no input sources, no data manipulation, no output sinks, nor any operations that could be malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The structure and format are straightforward and typical for defining custom warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining custom warning classes for deprecation and version changes. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
