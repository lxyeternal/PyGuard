  "purpose": "Define custom warning classes for deprecation and version-specific notifications related to Marshmallow 4.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; code relies on class definitions and inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class inheritance is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom warning classes inheriting from standard warning classes. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data handling. The structure is simple and static, serving as part of a warning system for library deprecation notices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign declaration of warning classes with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
