  "purpose": "Define custom warning classes related to Marshmallow version updates and deprecations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definitions do not include data input mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks; no execution of untrusted code or system commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code consists solely of class definitions without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines three custom warning classes inheriting from Python's DeprecationWarning and other custom warnings. There are no external data sources, no data flows, no potential for malicious behavior, and no suspicious activity. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of categorizing warnings for library deprecations and changes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and purposefully defines warning classes without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
