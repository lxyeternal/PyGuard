  "purpose": "Define custom warning classes for deprecation and version-specific warnings in Marshmallow library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions at the beginning of the code, inheriting from built-in Warning class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there is no data processing or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance without any unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines three custom warning classes inheriting from existing Python warning classes. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or complex logic. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for managing deprecation warnings related to Marshmallow version 4. However, on its own, it contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class inheritance setup for custom warnings; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and typical for warning management in Python projects.",
