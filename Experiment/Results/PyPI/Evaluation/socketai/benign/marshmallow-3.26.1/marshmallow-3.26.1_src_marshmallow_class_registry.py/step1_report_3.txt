{
  "purpose": "This code implements a registry system for marshmallow Schema classes, allowing registration and retrieval of classes by name or module path.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and registration calls (via register function), module and class attributes (__module__, __name__).",
  "sinks": "Retrieval functions (get_class) accessing _registry to return class objects based on user input.",
  "flows": "User inputs class name; get_class retrieves class list from _registry; if multiple classes found, may raise error or return list based on 'all' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution, network access, or system modifications detected. The code is straightforward registry logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple registry implementation for marshmallow Schema classes with functions to register and retrieve classes based on string identifiers. It uses class attributes (__module__) to map class objects. There is proper error handling for missing or multiple classes, and no evidence of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior. The data flow is confined within class registration and retrieval, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for managing schema classes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It functions as a registry for class objects with standard patterns and proper error handling.",
