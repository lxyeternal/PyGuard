  "purpose": "Utilities for storing and merging collections of error messages during data serialization, primarily used internally within marshmallow-related validation processes.",
  "sources": "Input data is implicitly received via method parameters such as messages, field_name, index, errors1, and errors2. No external data sources are directly accessed within this code.",
  "sinks": "The code manipulates internal data structures (dictionaries and lists) to store and merge errors. There are no sinks that involve network, file system, or system command executions.",
  "flows": "Input error messages are stored via store_error() and merged via merge_errors(). The data flows involve combining error message structures with no external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code performs standard data structure operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for error collection and a function for deep merging of error structures, handling various data formats (lists, dicts). It uses standard Python features, with no external data sources, network activity, or system commands. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward, focused on internal data management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for error handling with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any external communication, sensitive data handling, or risky operations.",
