  "purpose": "Utilities for storing and merging error messages during marshmallow validation processes.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures (errors dict, messages, error lists, nested dicts). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Internal error storage; no external sinks or data leaks; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Error messages are stored and merged within internal data structures; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data handling; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ErrorStore class for error collection and a recursive merge_errors function for deep merging error structures. It performs type checks and handles nested dicts and lists, consistent with marshmallow's error format. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The functions operate solely on data structures, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The logic is standard and safe, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for error handling in marshmallow. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero.",
