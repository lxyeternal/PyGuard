{
  "purpose": "Utility module for storing and merging collections of error messages, primarily used internally for serialization error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or untrusted data sources; the code manipulates error data structures within the application.",
  "sinks": "Error data structures and internal functions; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or written insecurely.",
  "flows": "Errors are stored and merged within internal data structures; no external flows or data exfiltration pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and focused on data structure management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for storing errors and a function for deeply merging error messages. It uses type checks and recursive merging logic to combine nested error structures. The implementation aligns with standard error handling and merging practices. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical utility for managing error messages with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no indications of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. The security risk is negligible.",
