  "purpose": "Provides decorators for registering schema pre-processing and post-processing methods in marshmallow, attaching metadata to functions for later invocation.",
  "sources": "Function definitions and attributes (__marshmallow_hook__) used to store hook configurations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks; only function attributes are modified.",
  "flows": "Decorators attach metadata to functions; no data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard decorator pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators that register functions as hooks for marshmallow schemas, storing configuration data in function attributes. It does not process untrusted input, execute external commands, or perform network operations. The functions are straightforward, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The use of functools.partial allows flexible decorator application. The overall pattern is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of decorator-based hook registration for marshmallow schemas. It poses no security threats, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The minimal risk score is justified by the lack of any malicious or insecure behavior.",
