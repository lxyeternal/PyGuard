  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SDK configuration class with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. To reflect the minimal risk more accurately, the securityRisk could be slightly lowered to 0.1, but 0.2 remains reasonable given the context."
