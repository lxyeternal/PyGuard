  "purpose": "Configuration class for setting up SDK parameters for API requests to Square's API, including environment, URL, credentials, headers, and HTTP client setup.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters for environment, custom_url, access_token, bearer_auth_credentials, headers, user_agent_detail; property getters for these attributes; methods like clone_with and create_auth_credentials_object.",
  "sinks": "Use of credentials in create_auth_credentials_object, setting base URI with append_url_with_template_parameters, and HTTP client creation via RequestsClient.",
  "flows": "Credentials and environment parameters flow into URL generation, HTTP client setup, and authorization object creation. Credentials used for authentication headers or tokens are set during initialization and cloning.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; usage of warnings.warn for deprecated parameters, which is benign; no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL manipulations beyond standard placeholder substitution. Use of deepcopy on headers is standard. No external data sources or untrusted input sources evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class for API client setup with customizable environment, URL, headers, and credentials. It uses standard practices such as property getters, deep copies of headers, and warnings for deprecated parameters. Credential handling involves warnings but otherwise follows typical OAuth token management. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or malicious network actions are present. URL construction relies on template substitution without evident malicious manipulation. HTTP client creation uses a third-party RequestsClient, with no malicious behavior noted. Overall, the code appears benign, focused on configuration management, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for API interactions with no malicious behavior detected. It manages credentials, environment, and request setup securely and transparently. No supply chain or malware indicators are present. It is safe based on the provided content.",
