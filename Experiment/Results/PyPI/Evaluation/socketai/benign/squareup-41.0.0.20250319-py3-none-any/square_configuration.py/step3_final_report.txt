{
  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for setting up the SDK environment, credentials, URL endpoints, and HTTP client behavior for the Square API.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters such as access_token, bearer_auth_credentials, environment, custom_url, and additional_headers during initialization and cloning.",
  "sinks": "Uses credentials to authenticate requests, constructs URLs based on environment settings, and configures HTTP client parameters for network communication.",
  "flows": "Credential parameters flow into authentication objects; environment and URL parameters influence request endpoints; configuration settings propagate to HTTP client setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; warnings about deprecated parameters are standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK configuration class managing environment settings, credentials, and HTTP client setup. It handles credentials securely via object creation, uses URL templates for environment-specific endpoints, and includes standard validation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The warning about deprecated parameters is benign. The overall structure is typical for SDK setup modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SDK configuration class with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. To reflect the minimal risk more accurately, the securityRisk could be slightly lowered to 0.1, but 0.2 remains reasonable given the context.",
