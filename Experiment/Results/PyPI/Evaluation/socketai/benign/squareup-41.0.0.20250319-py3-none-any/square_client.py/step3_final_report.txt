{
  "purpose": "The code defines a client class for the Square API SDK, initializing various API modules with lazy-loaded properties and configuring authentication and environment settings.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, environment variables, input parameters such as access_token and custom_url, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "API requests utilizing credentials and tokens, setting headers, OAuth2 authentication flows.",
  "flows": "Configuration setup from parameters/environment → OAuth2 authentication → API method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard SDK initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical SDK client setup patterns, with credentials supplied externally and no embedded secrets or malicious logic. It uses lazy properties for API modules, manages configuration securely, and does not perform any network activity or data leakage within this snippet. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The configuration and authentication handling are standard and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK client for Square's API, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified, reflecting minimal inherent risk in SDK initialization, assuming external credential management is secure.",
