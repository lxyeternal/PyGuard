  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK client for Square's API, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified, reflecting minimal inherent risk in SDK initialization, assuming external credential management is secure."
