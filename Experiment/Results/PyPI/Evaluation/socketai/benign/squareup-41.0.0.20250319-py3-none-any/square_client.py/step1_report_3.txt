  "purpose": "Defines a Client class for interacting with Square APIs, initializing various API components and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute initializations, constructor parameters, configuration setup, lazy property methods for API instances.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of API instances, configuration objects, authorization tokens, and HTTP client configurations.",
  "flows": "Initialization of API classes and configurations, assignment of OAuth tokens and authorization credentials, setup of global headers and user agents.",
  "anomalies": "The code is predominantly boilerplate API client setup. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible; sensitive data appears to be passed via parameters or configuration objects. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a structured client interface for Square API services, utilizing lazy loading for API components and a configurable setup for authentication and HTTP options. It manages OAuth credentials and headers securely by passing them through configuration objects. There are no signs of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity. The code's purpose is to facilitate API interactions and not to perform any suspicious actions. The code appears to be standard SDK initialization logic with no hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK client setup with no malicious behavior detected. It handles API configuration and authorization securely, with no signs of sabotage, data leakage, or malicious code.",
