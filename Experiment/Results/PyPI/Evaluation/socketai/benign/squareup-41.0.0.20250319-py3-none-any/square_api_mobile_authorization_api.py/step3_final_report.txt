  "purpose": "A client wrapper for Square's /mobile/authorization-code endpoint, facilitating generation of one-time authorization codes for mobile applications.",
  "sources": "External configuration for authorization token; request body parameter; request headers for content type and accept.",
  "sinks": "Network request to /mobile/authorization-code endpoint, transmitting serialized JSON data with authorization headers.",
  "flows": "Input 'body' object serialized into JSON, sent via POST request with headers, response deserialized into ApiResponse object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard SDK implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a straightforward API call, serializing input data, setting headers, and handling response. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The authorization token is externally supplied, and no secrets are embedded. The request flow is typical for SDKs interacting with REST APIs. The security risk is minimal, aligned with standard API client practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting low inherent risk but acknowledging potential external token handling concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK component for API interaction with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Overall, it poses negligible security risk within supply chain considerations.",
