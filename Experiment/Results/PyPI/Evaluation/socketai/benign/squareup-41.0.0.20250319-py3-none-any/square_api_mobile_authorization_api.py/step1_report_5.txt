{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API client class for creating mobile authorization codes via the Square API.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration, request bodies (body parameter), and uses predefined libraries for API request construction.",
  "sinks": "The code sends HTTP requests with headers and body data to an external API endpoint; potential data leakage could occur if sensitive data is mishandled.",
  "flows": "Configuration data and request bodies are used to build and send an HTTP POST request to /mobile/authorization-code endpoint, with authorization headers and JSON body serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; the code uses external API keys or tokens provided at runtime. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. Use of external libraries appears standard. No unusual code patterns or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client method implementation for Square's API. It constructs an HTTP POST request with appropriate headers, serialized body, and authorization. The URL, headers, and request serialization follow standard patterns. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation. The code relies on external configuration and libraries for secure operation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client implementation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and uses standard best practices for API calls. No malicious or harmful behavior detected.",
