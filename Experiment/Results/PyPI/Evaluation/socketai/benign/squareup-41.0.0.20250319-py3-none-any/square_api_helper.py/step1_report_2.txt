  "purpose": "Helper class for API call-related utility functions, providing static methods for API request operations.",
  "sources": "Import from 'apimatic_core.utilities.api_helper' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication found.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths observable within the given code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass 'APIHelper' extending 'ApiHelper' with a docstring explaining its purpose. It imports a utility module but contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The structure appears standard for a utility class design. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward class extension with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as a helper utility class for API operations without any suspicious behavior.",
