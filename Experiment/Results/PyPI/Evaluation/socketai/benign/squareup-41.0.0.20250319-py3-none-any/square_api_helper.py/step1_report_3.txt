  "purpose": "A helper class for various API call-related functions, primarily providing static utility methods.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'apimatic_core.utilities.api_helper', which imports functions or classes from an external module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow is apparent within this snippet; it mainly defines a class that extends another class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The class is straightforward and does not contain executable code beyond inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'APIHelper' inheriting from 'ApiHelper', with no methods or executable code. It appears to be a standard utility class with static methods. No input reading, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent are evident. The import from a seemingly legitimate package suggests standard dependency usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious class extension intended for utility functions related to API calls. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks identified in this snippet.",
