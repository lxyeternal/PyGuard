{
  "purpose": "Provide helper functions for API call operations by extending a core utility class.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; relies on imported ApiHelper class.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing, storage, or network communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class appears to be a utility extension without active data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Class only contains a docstring with no implemented methods or logic; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ApiHelper with only a descriptive docstring and no executable code, method definitions, or data handling logic. It imports a utility module but does not perform any operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a benign structural placeholder or partial implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward subclass extension with no executable logic or malicious content. It serves as a foundation or template for further development, with no security concerns based on the provided fragment.",
