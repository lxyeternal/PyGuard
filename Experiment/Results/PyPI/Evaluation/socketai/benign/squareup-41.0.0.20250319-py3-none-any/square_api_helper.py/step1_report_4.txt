  "purpose": "Define a helper class for API-related utility functions, extending functionalities from an imported ApiHelper class.",
  "sources": "Import statement for ApiHelper from apimatic_core.utilities.api_helper",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing shown",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present in this fragment; no source-to-sink flow visible",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears straightforward with standard class extension and documentation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility class and defines a subclass intended to encapsulate static helper methods for API calls. The class is well-documented. There are no signs of data manipulation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. The snippet is incomplete but contains no suspicious constructs or behavior at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code segment is a standard class extension serving as a utility wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger API client framework.",
