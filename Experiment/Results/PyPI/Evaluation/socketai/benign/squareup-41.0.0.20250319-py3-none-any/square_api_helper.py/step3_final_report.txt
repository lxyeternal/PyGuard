{
  "purpose": "A helper class for various functions associated with API calls, serving as a static utility extension.",
  "sources": "Import of 'ApiHelper' from 'apimatic_core.utilities.api_helper'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no data input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class contains only a docstring and no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of methods, logic, or data processing; only a class declaration with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass 'APIHelper' that inherits from 'ApiHelper' with only a descriptive docstring. There are no methods, data handling, network operations, or suspicious patterns. The import statement is from a standard module, and the class appears to be a structural placeholder or extension. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign, non-executable nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural subclass with no active logic or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring reflects this. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
