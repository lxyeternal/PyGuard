  "purpose": "Helper class providing static methods for API call operations, extending a core utility class.",
  "sources": "Import of ApiHelper from the apimatic_core.utilities.api_helper module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "The class inherits functionality from ApiHelper; no explicit data flow or untrusted input handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining a subclass with no additional methods or logic. No suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility class and defines a subclass intended for API helper functions. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or input/output operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The only potential concern could be the imported module, but given the limited context, it appears to be a standard utility import. The subclass may be used elsewhere, but in this fragment, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard class extension with no malicious or suspicious features. It appears to be a harmless utility class setup for API-related helper functions.",
