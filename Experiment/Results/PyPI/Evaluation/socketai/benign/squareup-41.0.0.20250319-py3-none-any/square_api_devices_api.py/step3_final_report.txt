  "purpose": "API client for Square Devices API, providing methods to list, create, and retrieve device and device code information.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as cursor, id, device_id, body, etc., used in request construction.",
  "sinks": "Request URL paths, query parameters, headers, and request bodies where data flows into HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method arguments into request parameters, headers, and payloads, then to the API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API requests using standard patterns, with parameters properly injected into request components. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or insecure practices are present. The code uses established libraries and patterns for request building and response handling. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The data flow is straightforward, from method inputs to API calls, with proper serialization and deserialization. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured, benign API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Square Devices API with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. It follows best practices for request construction and response handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern about untrusted data handling. The code is safe for use in production environments.",
