  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client for managing order custom attributes in Square, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code uses standard patterns—request builders, serialization, explicit parameters—and finds no obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero, indicating minimal concern but justified given the API interaction).\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate. The code appears safe, and the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API client with potential sinks in request construction, but no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes that untrusted data could flow into request components but clarifies that this is standard for API clients. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low, consistent with the analysis).\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. The code is a typical API wrapper with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, the code is a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms that all data flows are typical, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (appropriate).\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate API client, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The report notes proper parameter handling, serialization, and authentication, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (appropriate).\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes standard patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (appropriate).\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malware or malicious code. The scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports give 0, which is consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in all cases, reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard API client, constructed with common patterns.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present.\n- The data flows are typical for API interactions, with parameters passed explicitly.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, considering the code's nature.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the nature of API client code that handles untrusted input, but no malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the slight risk score reflects the minimal inherent risk in API client code handling untrusted data.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The security assessment aligns well with the code content.",
