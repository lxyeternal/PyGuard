  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is a standard API client for Square's custom attribute management.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious constructs such as eval, exec, or hidden backdoors.\n   - Import statements and class structures are typical and legitimate.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious URL manipulations are present.\n   - The code uses standard request building and response handling patterns.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns or Flaws:**\n   - The main concern is the flow of untrusted data into request parameters, URL paths, headers, or bodies. However, this is inherent to API clients and is expected; the data is serialized and sent over the network.\n   - No indication of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.\n   - The code does not perform any insecure operations beyond constructing and sending API requests.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a 0.0, indicating no malware or malicious intent. This aligns with the analysis.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign a 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 to 0.2). Given the absence of malicious behavior and the fact that it is an API client, these are reasonable.\n\n4. **Summary of Analysis:**\n   - The code is a legitimate, auto-generated or standard API client for managing custom attributes via REST API calls.\n   - It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code.\n   - The data flows are straightforward, with parameters passed explicitly and serialized securely.\n   - No signs of security risks beyond typical API client exposure, which is expected.\n\n5. **Final Estimations:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malware detected)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to API clients, no vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and functions as a typical API client. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0.0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0.0**  \n- Risk score: **0.1**  \n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
