  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states that the code manages order custom attributes via Square API.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Data flows from method parameters into request components; no suspicious sinks identified.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard API request patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate API client; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, describes the client for managing custom attributes.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Highlights potential injection points in URL/path/query parameters but notes parameters are passed explicitly.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets; request construction appears standard.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward API client; no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate, describes the code as a client for managing custom attributes.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Same as above; data flows into request components.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; uses standard patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard API wrapper.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Same pattern; potential injection points but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Typical API client; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 fit.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Same as above; data flows into request components.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard API client; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the code's nature as a standard API client.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated API client for Square's custom attribute management.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- Data flows are typical for API interactions, with no suspicious logic.\n\n### My recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with all reports and analysis)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, reflecting standard API client behavior with potential injection points if inputs are not validated externally, but no direct evidence of vulnerability)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. It is a typical API wrapper with no security risks or malware indicators.",
