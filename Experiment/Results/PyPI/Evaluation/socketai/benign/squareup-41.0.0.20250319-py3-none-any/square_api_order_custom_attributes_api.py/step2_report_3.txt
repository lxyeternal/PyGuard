  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** API client for managing order custom attributes in Square.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. Uses standard patterns, explicit parameters, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the thorough analysis. The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious behavior. The confidence is high (0.95). This assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, managing custom attributes with detailed request construction.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; potential sinks involve request construction with untrusted data, but the code handles parameters explicitly.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The very low risk score is justified given the straightforward API client pattern. No malware detected, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** API client for custom attributes, similar functions.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard request building, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The risk score remains low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard API client, similar functions.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; standard patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Again, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; standard API client pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or contain suspicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, uses standard libraries, and is not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are low, reflecting the code's straightforward API client nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to potential misuse of untrusted inputs, but this is inherent in API clients and not malicious)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
