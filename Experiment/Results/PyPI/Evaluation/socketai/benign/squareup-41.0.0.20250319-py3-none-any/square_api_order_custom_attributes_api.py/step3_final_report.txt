  "purpose": "API client for managing order custom attributes in Square's API.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, URL path templates, request bodies, headers",
  "sinks": "Request components where parameters are injected; no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Parameters flow into request builder methods, serialized, and sent over network; no suspicious data flows or obfuscation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API requests using explicit parameters, standard request builder patterns, and serialization. No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. Data flows are straightforward, and the code adheres to typical API client design. No suspicious patterns or secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing custom attributes in Square. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given its nature as a standard API wrapper.",
