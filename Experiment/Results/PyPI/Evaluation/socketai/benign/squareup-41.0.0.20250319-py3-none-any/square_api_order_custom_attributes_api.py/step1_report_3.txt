{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python API client for managing custom attributes in Square orders, including listing, creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting custom attributes and their definitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as 'body', 'key', 'order_id', 'custom_attribute_key', 'visibility_filter', 'cursor', 'limit', 'version', and 'with_definition'. It also uses imported modules and classes for request building and response handling.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially be passed through method parameters into HTTP request components like query parameters, path parameters, headers, and request bodies, which are then serialized and sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (sources) into request parameters, headers, and body, then via serialization, into HTTP requests sent to the Square API endpoints. Responses are processed through deserialization into ApiResponse objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are evident. Usage of standard request building patterns with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The code mainly constructs API calls without executing any external or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client implementation using request builders and response handlers, with clear parameter handling, serialization, and authentication. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. All request URLs and methods match their purposes, and data flows appear straightforward. The code does not perform any unusual or suspicious actions, nor does it include any code that could be used for malicious purposes such as system manipulation, data exfiltration, or network anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured API client for managing custom attributes in Square orders. It does not contain any signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The request construction, data handling, and response processing are standard and do not indicate malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
