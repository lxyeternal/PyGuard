{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for managing Square webhook subscriptions, including listing, creating, deleting, retrieving, updating, and testing webhooks via REST API calls.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'api_version', 'cursor', 'body', 'subscription_id', etc., which are used to construct request URLs, query parameters, headers, and request bodies.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request construction points where untrusted input (parameters) are embedded into request URLs, query strings, headers, or bodies; response handling where data is deserialized.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request builder methods, which assemble the request; responses are processed via deserializer functions, converting raw responses into ApiResponse objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code follows standard SDK patterns without dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper for Square's webhook management endpoints. It constructs HTTP requests with supplied parameters, serializes request bodies, and deserializes responses. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The request parameters are used appropriately, and the code relies on external configuration for authentication. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK component for webhook management with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1-0.2). No further action is necessary.",
