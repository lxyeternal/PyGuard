{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for managing webhook subscriptions via the Square API, providing methods to list, create, retrieve, update, delete, and test webhooks.",
  "sources": "User inputs include 'subscription_id', 'body' objects, and optional query parameters; configuration data in 'config' during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data sources (e.g., 'subscription_id', 'body') are used in API request URLs and payloads. No direct data leaks or insecure data handling are observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs or function arguments are incorporated into API request URLs and bodies, then sent over HTTP requests. Data flows from arguments to request construction and transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are identified. The code performs standard API request constructions. No obfuscation, malicious loops, or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard API client wrapper for managing webhook subscriptions. It uses well-defined request builder patterns, incorporates user-provided parameters safely via template and query parameters, and serializes/deserializes JSON data appropriately. No malicious behaviors, such as unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, or system modifications, are present. The structure aligns with typical SDK code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API wrapper for managing webhooks in the Square API ecosystem. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It safely handles user inputs for API operations without evident vulnerabilities.",
