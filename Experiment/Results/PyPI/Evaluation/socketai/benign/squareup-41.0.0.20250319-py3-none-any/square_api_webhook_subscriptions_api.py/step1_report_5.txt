{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API client for managing webhook subscriptions in the Square API, including listing, creating, deleting, retrieving, updating, and testing webhooks.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data in __init__, API request parameters, method arguments for IDs, body data, and optional query parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request construction with parameters, request body serialization, API call execution, and response deserialization.",
  "flows": "Data from method arguments flows into request parameters and request bodies, which are then serialized and sent via HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Responses are deserialized into ApiResponse objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution. Usage of standard API request patterns. No suspicious external calls or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for webhook management with methods corresponding to API endpoints. Each method constructs an HTTP request with parameters, headers, and bodies, then executes it, handling responses accordingly. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The structure follows typical API client design, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent. No signs of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or other malware behaviors. The only data flows are related to API interactions and parameter passing, which are legitimate for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client for managing webhooks in the Square API, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely constructs and executes API requests without suspicious patterns or hidden functionalities.",
