  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a client interface for managing webhooks in Square API, with input parameters like 'api_version', 'cursor', etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies data flow from parameters into request construction and response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard API wrapper, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the API client, safe data handling, and absence of malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns. The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Also confirms the code as a standard API client with safe handling of user inputs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Continues the pattern of recognizing the code as a typical SDK client with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 is appropriate given the clear analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar assessment: standard API client, no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 fits.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward, request-building nature. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in an API client—mainly the risk associated with untrusted input flowing into requests. These are reasonable and not overestimated.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed reviews and the code's structure, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, typical for API wrappers, not indicating vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured API client for managing webhooks with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
