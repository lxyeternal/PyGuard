  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Clearly states the code manages webhooks via Square API, with parameters like 'api_version', 'cursor', etc. No issues here.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Data flows into request builders; no suspicious data handling or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms standard API client pattern, no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — aligns with the analysis.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data flow and standard patterns.  \n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Again, describes standard API wrapper behavior with safe parameter handling.  \n- No suspicious patterns or secrets.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — acceptable.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Reiterates the standard API client pattern, with proper parameter usage and no malicious signs.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — perfectly aligned.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar findings: standard API client, no obfuscation or malicious activity.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — consistent.  \n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal inherent API client risk, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final justification:\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client wrapper.  \n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious data flows.  \n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the code's nature.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard API client, minimal inherent risk)  \n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's actual content. The scores could even be slightly lowered, but they are reasonable as is.",
