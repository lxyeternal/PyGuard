  "purpose": "A client API class to manage webhook subscriptions in the Square API.",
  "sources": "HTTP request and response handling, input parameters such as 'subscription_id', 'body', 'api_version', 'cursor', 'include_disabled', 'sort_order', 'limit'.",
  "sinks": "Request payloads including bodies for creating, updating, and testing webhooks; URL path parameters such as 'subscription_id'; query parameters for listing webhooks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build request URL, headers, and body; these are serialized and sent over the network to Square API endpoints. Responses are deserialized back into objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious URL manipulation; no obfuscated code; no code that executes untrusted code dynamically; no unusual or hidden behaviors. The code strictly adheres to API request patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing webhook subscriptions with methods to list, create, delete, retrieve, update, and test webhooks via standard HTTP methods. It properly uses parameter serialization, URL templating, and authentication via 'Single'. No signs of malicious payload, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No suspicious obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalous code patterns are present. The use of request and response handlers is standard for API clients. The code appears legitimate and aligned with normal SDK practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client implementation for webhook management, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs API operations as intended without suspicious modifications or hidden functionalities.",
