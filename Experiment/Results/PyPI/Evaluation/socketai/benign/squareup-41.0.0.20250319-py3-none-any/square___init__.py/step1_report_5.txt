{
  "purpose": "Define a list of module or component names likely related to API handling and HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of module names assigned to __all__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this is a simple declaration of public API symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a list named __all__, which specifies the public interface of the module. It contains typical component names such as 'api_helper', 'apis', 'client', 'configuration', and 'http'. There are no functions, data processing, or untrusted input handling present. The code does not include any obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious constructs. As it is purely a list definition, it does not pose security risks or contain malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign declaration of public symbols for a Python module. It does not include any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a safe, normal part of a Python package.",
