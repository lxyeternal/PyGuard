  "purpose": "Defines a list of module or component names likely used for imports or exports in a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are observable in this code.",
  "anomalies": "This code only lists module names without any executable code or logic; no suspicious or unusual activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code merely assigns a list of strings to a variable __all__, which specifies the public interface of a module. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The list includes typical module names such as 'api_helper', 'apis', 'client', 'configuration', 'http', which are common in API client libraries. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module __all__ declaration listing public symbols. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The snippet is safe and typical of Python package modules.",
