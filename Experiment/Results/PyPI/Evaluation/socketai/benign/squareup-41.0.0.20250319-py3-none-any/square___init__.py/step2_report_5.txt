  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple list assignment to `__all__`, which is a common Python pattern for defining a module's public API.\n- No data input/output, no functions, no logic, no external interactions, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious activity are mentioned.\n- The confidence level is high (1) across all reports, indicating consensus on benign nature.\n- Malware scores are zero in all reports, aligning with the assessment that there is no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets are just list declarations assigning string literals to `__all__`.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources that could indicate security risks.\n- The purpose is solely to specify exported symbols, a standard practice in Python modules.\n\n### Flaws or logical issues:\n- No flaws or mistakes are apparent; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning that these snippets are benign and standard is correct.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, I agree with their assessments.\n- The code is entirely safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, standard Python module declaration of `__all__`. There are no suspicious elements, no malicious activity, and no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action or concern is warranted.",
