{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API components of a Python module by assigning a list of string identifiers to __all__, a standard practice for controlling module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static list assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple list assignment to __all__, listing module components. It contains no functions, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence scores (1), and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code aligns with standard Python practices for module exports and shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard __all__ declaration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
