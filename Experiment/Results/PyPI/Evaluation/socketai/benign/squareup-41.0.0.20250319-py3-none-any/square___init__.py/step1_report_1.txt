  "purpose": "Defines an __all__ list to specify public API components of a module",
  "sources": "No data input sources present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows as there are no functions or data processing logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed; only a list of module names",
  "analysis": "The code only declares an __all__ list with string entries indicating module components. There are no functions, classes, or data processing logic. It serves as a module API export control, which is standard practice. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. No obfuscation, secrets, or external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple list declaration for controlling module exports, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
