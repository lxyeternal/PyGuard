  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple list assignment to `__all__`, a common Python pattern for defining module exports.\n- None of the reports identify any executable code, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as expected.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets are purely declarative, listing module components.\n- No data flows, input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code snippets are standard practices for Python modules.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no modifications are necessary.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, straightforward `__all__` declaration.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate at 1, given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
