{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling cases where a model or object is used before being properly fitted.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class declaration for an exception named NotFittedError, inheriting from Exception, with a docstring. There are no functions, data handling, or external interactions. It appears to be a standard, harmless custom exception class used in machine learning or modeling contexts to indicate an unfitted state.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard exception class with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as a custom exception for handling errors related to unfit models.",
