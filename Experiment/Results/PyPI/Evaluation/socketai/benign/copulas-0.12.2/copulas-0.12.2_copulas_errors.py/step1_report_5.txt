  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to unfit models in copula-based algorithms.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception class, intended for signaling that a model or component has not been fitted. The class is straightforward with only a docstring and no additional methods or logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class definition for a custom exception with no malicious intent or security issues.",
