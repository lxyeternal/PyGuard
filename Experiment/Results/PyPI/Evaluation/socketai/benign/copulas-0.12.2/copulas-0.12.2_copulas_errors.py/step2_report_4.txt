  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code defines a single class `NotFittedError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports are consistent in stating that the code is benign, simple, and standard.\n- They correctly identify that the class is a custom exception for indicating an unfitted model state.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. Scores assigned to each issue:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and harmless nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The highest scores are 1 for confidence, which is justified because the code is clearly a benign exception class.\n- Malware and security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as code injection, obfuscation, or malicious data handling.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. Challenging claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly state that the code is a simple class definition.\n- No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n7. Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent in their scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, harmless custom exception class.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores or analysis are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- Risk score: 0.1 (very low; only a minimal custom exception class, no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations.",
