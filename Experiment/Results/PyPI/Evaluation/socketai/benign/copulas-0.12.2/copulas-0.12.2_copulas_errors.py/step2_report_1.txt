  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward class definition for `NotFittedError`, inheriting from `Exception`. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a minimal, benign custom exception class with no malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their observations. They all note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security issues.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are present in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risk, and the code is just a simple exception class, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign exception class.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond the scope of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Validity:** The code is a standard, harmless custom exception class with no issues.\n- **Malware, Obfuscation, Security Risks:** All scores are appropriately zero.\n- **Overall Risk:** Very low; the code is safe.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a typical, safe custom exception class with no security concerns. No changes to scores are necessary.",
