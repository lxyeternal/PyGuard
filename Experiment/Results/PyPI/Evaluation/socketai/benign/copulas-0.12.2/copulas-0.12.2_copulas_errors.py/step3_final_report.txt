  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'NotFittedError' for signaling that a model or component has not been fitted.",
  "sources": "Class definition, inherits from 'Exception', no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward class inheritance without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, clear, and standard for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class with no methods, data, or external interactions. It contains only a docstring and inherits from 'Exception'. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions in Python. No anomalies or security concerns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the benign and minimal nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports accurately assess the code as harmless, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
