  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a single class `NotFittedError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It contains only a docstring; no methods, data, or logic.\n   - The class is intended as a custom exception for signaling that a model or component hasn't been fitted.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - No external data handling, input/output, or data flow.\n   - No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for custom exceptions.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (`0`).\n   - **Malware:** All reports correctly assign `0` since there's no malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk:** No security risks are evident; all reports assign `0`.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Errors in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple, harmless exception class.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n5. **Assessment of the Scores:**\n   - The `risk` score is not explicitly given, but implied to be `0` in the reports, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code is benign, the scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The reports are thorough in their reasoning.\n   - They correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based solely on this minimal code snippet.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:** The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is harmless, with scores appropriately assigned. No changes needed.",
