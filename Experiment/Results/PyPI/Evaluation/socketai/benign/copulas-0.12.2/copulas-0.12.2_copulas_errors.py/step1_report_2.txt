  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named NotFittedError for handling cases where a model or object has not been fitted.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code does not read data or input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code is a straightforward exception class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It contains a docstring and no executable or suspicious code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. It is a minimal, standard pattern for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
