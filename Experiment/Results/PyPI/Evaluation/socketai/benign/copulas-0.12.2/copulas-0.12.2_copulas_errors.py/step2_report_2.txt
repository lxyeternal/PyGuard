  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`NotFittedError`) inheriting from `Exception`. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data handling. The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, data flows, or external interactions. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and harmlessness of the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is purely defining a custom exception, the risk scores are justified as 0. No higher scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there is no malicious activity or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, harmless custom exception class with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of My Expert Evaluation:\n\nThe code is a minimal, straightforward class definition serving as a custom exception. There are no issues related to malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation**: Keep the scores at zero for malware and risk, and confirm that the code is benign.",
