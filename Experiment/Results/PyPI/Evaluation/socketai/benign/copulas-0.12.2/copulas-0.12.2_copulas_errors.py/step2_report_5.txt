  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Actual Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal class definition for a custom exception named `NotFittedError`.\n   - The code contains no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The class is a standard pattern in Python for custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores & Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The `malware` score is correctly zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is zero, as there's no security concern.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is a simple exception class with no suspicious features, raising the risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The only reason to consider a higher score might be if the code were embedded maliciously or obfuscated, which it is not.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions & Claims:**\n   - The reports assume that the class is used in a benign context, which is reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made, and none are supported by the code.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary & Personal Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I agree with the reports' assessments and scores. There is no reason to assign higher risk or malware scores here.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, harmless custom exception class.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
