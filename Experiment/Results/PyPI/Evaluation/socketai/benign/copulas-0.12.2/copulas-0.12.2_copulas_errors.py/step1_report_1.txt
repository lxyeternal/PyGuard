  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to unfit models in copula-based computations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single class definition for a custom exception named NotFittedError, inheriting from Exception. It includes a docstring but no other logic, data handling, or external interactions. The class appears to be intended for use in larger codebases to signal specific error conditions related to model fitting, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, harmless custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern used in Python to improve error handling clarity.",
