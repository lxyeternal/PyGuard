{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) model, providing functionalities for fitting, sampling, and calculating probability densities and distribution functions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'dataset' parameter during _get_model and _get_bounds methods; input data in probability_density, cumulative_distribution, percent_point, and _fit methods; uses random_state for seed control.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include probability densities, cumulative distribution values, and samples; potential for untrusted input in U (percent_point) leading to calculation flows; no evident data leaks or malicious data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (dataset, U, X) through methods for evaluation or sampling, with internal calls to _get_model and _get_bounds; flow from untrusted input U to _f in percent_point, then to bisect/chandrupatla for inverse CDF; no external network or system manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; standard statistical modeling code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GaussianKDE class with methods for fitting, sampling, evaluating probability densities, and inverse CDF computation. It employs standard scipy and numpy functions, handles edge cases for input validation, and provides flexible methods for distribution analysis. The code relies on well-known libraries, with proper validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms. The only potential concern is that it accepts untrusted input for U in percent_point, but this is necessary for inverse CDF calculations and is handled with validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate statistical modeling implementation without malicious intent. It performs KDE-related tasks with proper validation and standard practices. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Overall, the code is safe for use in the context of statistical modeling.",
