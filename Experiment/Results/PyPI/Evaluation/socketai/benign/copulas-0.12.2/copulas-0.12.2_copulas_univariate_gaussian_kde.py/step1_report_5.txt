{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to provide a Python class wrapper for Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) as part of a larger statistical modeling framework, enabling density estimation, sampling, and cumulative distribution calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'dataset' parameter in self._params, which is set during fitting (_fit method). It also reads inputs to methods like probability_density, sample, cumulative_distribution, and percent_point.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the evaluation of the model's density (_model.evaluate), sampling (_model.resample), and cumulative distribution calculations, which may process untrusted input if user-provided data is fed into these methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into methods such as probability_density, sample, cumulative_distribution, and percent_point, which use self._model to perform calculations. These methods rely on the 'dataset' parameter and input arrays U or X, with flow to evaluate density, generate samples, or compute inverse CDFs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. No unusual behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. It uses standard library functions and scientific computing libraries appropriately. The use of random_state and data sampling appears legitimate within statistical modeling context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for Gaussian KDE, which is a statistical method for density estimation. It properly validates random state, manages parameters, and provides methods for density evaluation, sampling, and inverse CDF calculations. All data manipulations and computations are consistent with normal KDE usage. No code suggests malicious intent, secret leak, or malicious data handling. The code’s structure and content appear standard for a scientific modeling library, with no suspicious code flow or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Gaussian KDE as part of a larger modeling framework. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The only potential concern could be if user inputs to methods are untrusted, but this is expected in statistical modeling libraries and does not indicate malicious intent.",
