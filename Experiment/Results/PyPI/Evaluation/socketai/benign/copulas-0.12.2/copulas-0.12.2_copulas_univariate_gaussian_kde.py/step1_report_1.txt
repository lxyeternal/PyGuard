{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) model wrapper for statistical analysis and sampling, providing functionalities like probability density computation, sampling, and cumulative distribution calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'dataset' parameter, input points for probability density, cumulative distribution, and inverse cumulative distribution functions, as well as parameters for model configuration such as 'sample_size', 'random_state', 'bw_method', and 'weights'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if the model's evaluation or sampling results are improperly exposed or logged; the code does not directly send data over the network or write to files, so no external sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'dataset' into the model during fitting; input points for distribution functions are evaluated via self._model; random sampling is performed from the model; distribution calculations depend on model parameters and input U values for inverse functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. Usage of standard libraries and safe practices are observed. No suspicious obfuscation or unusual code patterns detected. No external network calls, file manipulations, or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a statistical model wrapper with methods for fitting data, evaluating probability densities, sampling, and distribution calculations. It validates inputs, manages internal model parameters, and uses standard scientific libraries. All operations are within expected statistical modeling scope. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows identified. The code's design is straightforward and safe, focusing on statistical computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Gaussian KDE wrapper for statistical analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. Its functionality is aligned with typical statistical modeling tasks, with no evident security risks or malware. It can be considered safe based on this review.",
