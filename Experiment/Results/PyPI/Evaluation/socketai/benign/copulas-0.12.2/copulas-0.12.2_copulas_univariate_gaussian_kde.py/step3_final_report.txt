  "purpose": "A wrapper for gaussian Kernel density estimation, providing methods for fitting, evaluating probability density, sampling, and computing cumulative and inverse cumulative distributions.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset from 'dataset' parameter; inputs for probability evaluation, sampling, and inverse CDF calculations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs probability densities, samples, and inverse CDF values; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal model evaluation and sampling functions; no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation wrapping scipy's gaussian_kde. It performs typical statistical operations with proper input validation and parameter management. No malicious or suspicious constructs are present. Input validation in 'percent_point' ensures safe inverse CDF computation. The code does not perform any external network or file operations. All functions serve legitimate statistical purposes, and no signs of malware or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a Gaussian KDE wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is secure and suitable for use.",
