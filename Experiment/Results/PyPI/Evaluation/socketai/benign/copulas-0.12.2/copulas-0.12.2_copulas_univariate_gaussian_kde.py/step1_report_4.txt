  "purpose": "A wrapper class for Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation, providing methods for fitting, sampling, and computing probability and cumulative distribution functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'dataset' parameter during fitting; external parameters via constructor such as 'sample_size', 'random_state', 'bw_method', 'weights'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include evaluated probability densities, sampled data, cumulative distribution values, and inverse CDFs. No data leakage or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input datasets to model fitting (_fit method), then to probability_density, cumulative_distribution, and percent_point methods. No untrusted data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of standard libraries and methods. The code manages random states securely. No unusual behaviors or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard wrapper for scipy's gaussian_kde, including fitting, sampling, and distribution calculations. Uses validated random state handling and flexible parameters. No indications of malicious or sabotage behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The methods are straightforward, and parameters are managed carefully. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a Gaussian KDE wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It adheres to expected design patterns and uses secure parameter handling. Overall, low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
