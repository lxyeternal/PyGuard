  "purpose": "A wrapper class for the scipy.stats.loglaplace distribution to fit and handle log-Laplace distributions within a larger modeling framework.",
  "sources": "Input data X in _fit_constant and _fit methods.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data outputs or external calls other than scipy.stats functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X to the fit functions, which compute distribution parameters; parameters are stored internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The class solely wraps scipy functions for statistical modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for statistical distribution fitting, utilizing scipy.stats.loglaplace. It sets fixed parameters in _fit_constant and dynamically fits parameters in _fit. The methods operate purely on input data and internal variables, with no external network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard statistical wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply performs distribution fitting tasks without external communication or suspicious behavior.",
