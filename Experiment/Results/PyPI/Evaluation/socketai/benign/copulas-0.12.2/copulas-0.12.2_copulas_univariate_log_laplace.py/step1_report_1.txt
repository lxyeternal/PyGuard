{
  "purpose": "This module provides a wrapper for the scipy.stats.loglaplace distribution, enabling fitting and constant extraction functionalities for LogLaplace distributions within a larger probabilistic modeling framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data X in the _fit_constant and _fit methods to fit the distribution parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any obvious sinks that send data externally or perform insecure operations. It primarily processes data locally.",
  "flows": "Input data X flows into the _fit_constant and _fit methods, where distribution parameters are estimated and stored internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a base model, utilizing scipy.stats for distribution fitting. It stores parameters in a class attribute without performing any network operations, system modifications, or executing external code. The methods are straightforward, mainly fitting a distribution and handling parameters. No potential security issues or malicious behavior are detected. The logic is standard for statistical modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of a probabilistic distribution wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply performs distribution fitting and parameter extraction, relying on standard libraries.",
