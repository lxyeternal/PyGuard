{
  "purpose": "This module provides a wrapper for the scipy.stats.loglaplace distribution, allowing for fitting and extracting parameters related to the LogLaplace distribution, likely used in probabilistic modeling or data analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data X in the _fit_constant and _fit methods to fit the distribution parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not perform network operations, file I/O, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X through fitting methods to set distribution parameters; no untrusted data is routed elsewhere or manipulated in a harmful way.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Usage of standard libraries and typical fitting procedures are observed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a wrapper around scipy's loglaplace distribution. It includes parameter fitting, constant detection, and value extraction, all of which are standard for statistical modeling. No external data is transmitted, and there are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard wrapper for statistical distribution fitting with no malicious intent. It performs typical data fitting and parameter extraction without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
