  "purpose": "A wrapper around scipy.stats.loglaplace for fitting and extracting parameters of the distribution.",
  "sources": "Input data X used in _fit and _fit_constant methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed locally within methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X into fit methods, parameters are stored internally.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard methods for fitting a loglaplace distribution, checking if data is constant, and extracting parameters. It uses well-known libraries without external communication. The _fit_constant method sets scale to zero, indicating a degenerate distribution for constant data, which is acceptable. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard statistical wrapper with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could set the overall security risk to zero for increased conservativeness.",
