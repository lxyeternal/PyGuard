  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard statistical univariate distribution class with selection, fitting, sampling, and serialization. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minor concern due to pickle serialization but generally low.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is typical for such a library, with no malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on pickle's security implications.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4 — slightly higher, reflecting the inherent risk of pickle deserialization if used improperly.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identifies pickle as a potential security concern, but not malicious. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same core findings; highlights pickle's security implications.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No signs of malware, just standard serialization risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the code, with focus on pickle serialization risk.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, just a typical serialization concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; no malicious behavior, standard modeling framework.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Justification for Risk Scores:** The primary concern is the use of pickle for serialization/deserialization, which can be exploited if untrusted files are loaded. This is a common and well-understood security risk but not an indication of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — standard serialization risk; low but worth noting.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate statistical modeling framework with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The serialization via pickle is a known security concern but not malicious in itself.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the reports and thorough analysis, I agree with the assigned scores. The code is safe, with the only caveat being careful handling of pickle files to prevent deserialization attacks.",
