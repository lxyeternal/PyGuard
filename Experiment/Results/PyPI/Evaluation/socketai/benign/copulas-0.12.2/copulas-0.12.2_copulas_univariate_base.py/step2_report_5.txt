  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as classes for univariate distribution modeling, selection, fitting, sampling, and serialization.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code detected; standard distribution logic; pickle used for serialization.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, with high confidence (0.9).  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior is evident.  \n- The only concern is pickle's inherent risk if untrusted data is loaded, but the report correctly notes this.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, focusing on modeling and serialization.\n- **Findings:** Highlights the security concern with pickle, which can execute arbitrary code if loading malicious files.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, with confidence 0.8.  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly identifies pickle as a security risk but notes that this is a common practice and not malicious per se.  \n- The reasoning is balanced; no malicious intent is claimed.  \n- **Score adjustments:** Given the potential risk, perhaps a minimal increase in security risk score (e.g., 0.4) could be justified, but since no actual malicious code exists, keeping it at 0 is acceptable.  \n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same general purpose, with mention of scipy wrappers.\n- **Findings:** Emphasizes pickle serialization as a potential attack vector but no malicious code.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, confidence 0.9.  \n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly notes the security concern with pickle, but no malicious behavior.  \n- The reasoning aligns with standard security considerations.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n**Conclusion:** Valid and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with emphasis on modeling and serialization.\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with focus on pickle risks.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, confidence 0.9.  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity detected.  \n- The security concern about pickle remains valid but not indicative of malware.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar description, emphasizing the modeling framework.\n- **Findings:** Notes the use of pickle as a potential security risk but no malicious code.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, confidence 0.9.  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is appropriate; pickle's risk is acknowledged but not equated with malicious intent.  \n- No signs of sabotage or malware.  \n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard statistical modeling framework.\n- The primary security concern is the use of pickle for serialization/deserialization, which can be exploited if loading untrusted files. However, this is a common pattern in Python and not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The assigned malware scores of 0 across all reports are justified.\n- The security risk scores are generally low, reflecting awareness of pickle's potential risks but not indicating active vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2 to 0.4** — mainly due to pickle serialization; perhaps a slight increase to 0.3-0.4 if considering potential misuse, but current scores are reasonable.\n\n**In conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no malware or malicious intent. The security concern about pickle should be noted but does not elevate the risk to a high level.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- For enhanced security, recommend avoiding loading untrusted pickle files or using safer serialization methods when possible.  \n- No further action needed based on the current analysis.",
