  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical modeling framework with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only notable concern is the use of pickle serialization, which is a common security risk if untrusted data is loaded. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are justified."
