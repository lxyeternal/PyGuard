{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for univariate distribution modeling, including selection, fitting, sampling, and serialization functionalities, primarily for statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements (pickle, numpy, and other internal modules); class attributes and methods reading/writing distribution parameters; file operations in save/load methods.",
  "sinks": "File operations (save/load) which could write/read arbitrary files; potential use of pickle for serialization which could execute malicious code during unpickling.",
  "flows": "Serialization methods (save/load) could read/write arbitrary files; pickled data could contain malicious payloads during unpickling; no direct network or external data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization, which is inherently unsafe if loading untrusted data; no other suspicious code like hardcoded credentials, network connections, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides classes for statistical modeling with methods for fitting, sampling, and serializing distribution objects. The use of pickle in save/load methods is notable because unpickling untrusted data can execute arbitrary code, which is a common security concern. No hardcoded secrets or malicious commands are present. The code structure appears standard for a statistical modeling library; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are detected. The reliance on external library 'copulas' and standard Python modules appears legitimate. Overall, the main security risk arises from the use of pickle for serialization/deserialization, which can be exploited if used improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate statistical modeling utility with standard methods and good structure. The primary security concern is the use of pickle for serialization, which can be exploited if loading untrusted files. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage beyond this typical risk associated with pickle.",
