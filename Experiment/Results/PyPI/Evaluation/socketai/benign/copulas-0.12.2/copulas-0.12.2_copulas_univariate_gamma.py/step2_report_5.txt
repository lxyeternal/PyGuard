  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper around scipy's gamma distribution functions.\n- It performs standard statistical operations: fitting parameters, checking if the distribution is constant, and extracting constant values.\n- No network operations, file I/O, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code uses standard libraries and appears clean and well-structured.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- I agree with these assessments; there's no indication of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0 or very close to 0, with one report giving 0.1.\n- Given the code's nature, this is appropriate. The code does not perform any insecure operations or handle untrusted data in a way that would introduce security risks.\n- The one report with 0.1 seems slightly overcautious; I would rate it closer to 0.\n\n**Purpose and Analysis Validity:**\n- All reports correctly identify the purpose as a statistical wrapper for gamma distribution modeling.\n- The analysis notes the use of standard libraries, no suspicious behaviors, and proper implementation.\n- These assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Any issues or logical flaws?**\n- No. The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No report overstates or understates the risk or malware potential.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a typical implementation of a univariate gamma distribution wrapper, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The assessments are correct, and the code poses no security concern.",
