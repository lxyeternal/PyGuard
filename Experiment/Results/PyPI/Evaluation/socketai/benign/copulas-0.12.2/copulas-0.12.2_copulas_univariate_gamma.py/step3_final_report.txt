  "purpose": "A wrapper around scipy.stats.gamma for fitting and analyzing gamma distributions, providing methods to fit parameters, detect constants, and extract constant values.",
  "sources": "Input data X used in _fit and _fit_constant methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or external data output present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into _fit and _fit_constant methods; no external data flows or data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation wrapping scipy's gamma distribution functions, performing parameter fitting and constant detection. It does not perform any network communication, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. All signals indicate benign, typical statistical modeling code. The minimal security risk score assigned in one report (0.1) is unwarranted; the code does not pose any security threat. Malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk should be 0 across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, except for the minor security risk score in one report, which should be lowered to 0. Overall, the code is safe within supply chain security considerations.",
