{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to implement a univariate gamma distribution model for statistical fitting, specifically as part of a larger copula modeling framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data X for fitting the distribution and extracting constant values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter X through the fit methods to determine distribution parameters, and potentially to the _extract_constant method for retrieving constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of standard scipy.stats.gamma functions and numpy operations appear normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class wrapping scipy's gamma distribution for univariate modeling. It includes methods for fitting parameters, detecting if the distribution is constant, and extracting constant values. All functions use standard libraries and follow typical implementation patterns without any suspicious logic. There are no embedded network calls, code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for statistical modeling within a larger framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a gamma distribution wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a statistical model component without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
