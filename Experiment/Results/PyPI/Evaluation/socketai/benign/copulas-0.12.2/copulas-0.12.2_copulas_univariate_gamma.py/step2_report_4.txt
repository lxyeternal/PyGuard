  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper around `scipy.stats.gamma`, with methods for fitting, constant detection, and constant extraction.\n- All reports consistently state that the code uses standard libraries, no obfuscation, no network or file operations, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments.\n- The only point that stands out is in report 4, which assigns a `securityRisk` score of 0.1, while others assign 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code appears correct and does not contain bugs or vulnerabilities. The functions are standard and well-implemented.\n\n- **Malicious activity / malware:**  \n  No evidence of malicious activity. The code only performs statistical fitting.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  None observed.\n\n- **Security risks:**  \n  No evident security risks, except the minor `securityRisk` in report 4, which seems unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- All reports give `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0, except report 4, which gives 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, a score of 0.1 is unwarranted unless there is an unmentioned concern. Since no such concern exists, this score should be lowered to 0.\n- The `risk` scores are all 0 or very close to 0, which seems appropriate given the code.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code's functionality is limited to statistical modeling; it does not perform any dangerous operations.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic.\n- The only questionable score is in report 4, which assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1; this should be adjusted to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust all `securityRisk` scores to 0**, as there is no evidence of security issues.\n- **Maintain `malware` and `obfuscated` scores at 0**.\n- **Estimate for the entire set:**\n\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign, standard implementation of a statistical model wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are mostly appropriate, except for the minor security risk in report 4, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code.",
