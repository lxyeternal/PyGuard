{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class GammaUnivariate that wraps around scipy's gamma distribution for statistical modeling, fitting, and constant value extraction.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters (X) in _fit_constant and _fit functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations such as network access, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameter X into the _fit and _fit_constant methods, which process the data to determine distribution parameters. These parameters are stored internally and used within the class.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for statistical modeling, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs. The method for handling constant data sets is explicitly implemented. No unusual behaviors or malicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The module imports necessary scientific libraries (numpy, scipy), defines a class for gamma distribution modeling, and provides methods for fitting data and identifying constant data points. All operations are straightforward and typical for such modeling. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious logic, or obfuscated code. The code is well-structured, and the logic is clear and standard for statistical fitting procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a gamma univariate model for statistical purposes. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data fitting and constant value detection without any suspicious behavior.",
