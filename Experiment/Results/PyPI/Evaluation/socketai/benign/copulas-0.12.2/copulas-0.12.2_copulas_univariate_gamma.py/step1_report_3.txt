{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class for modeling and fitting a univariate Gamma distribution, likely for statistical or data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through the _fit and _fit_constant methods, specifically the parameter X, which is used in gamma.fit(X).",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data (X) flows into the gamma.fit(X) function for parameter estimation; the parameters are then stored internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries (numpy, scipy) and no obfuscated or dynamic code. No unusual or malicious behavior is detectable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around scipy's gamma distribution functions. It implements methods for fitting the distribution to data, checking if the distribution is constant, and extracting constants. It uses standard practices and libraries, with no signs of malicious or suspicious code. There are no network connections, file operations, or code injections. The methods operate solely on input data and internal parameters, with no signs of data leaks or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a statistical model wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard coding practices and utilizes common libraries without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
