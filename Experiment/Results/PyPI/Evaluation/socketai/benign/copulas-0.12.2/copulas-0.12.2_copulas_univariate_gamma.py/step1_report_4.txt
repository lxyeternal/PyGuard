{
  "purpose": "This module provides a wrapper class for the scipy.stats.gamma distribution, intended for univariate gamma distribution modeling within a larger probabilistic framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data 'X' during the _fit_constant and _fit methods, which are used to fit the gamma distribution parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is sent or where data could be leaked; the code primarily processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'X' into the _fit and _fit_constant methods, with parameters extracted and stored in self._params; no external data or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard for a statistical model wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for fitting and handling a gamma distribution, using standard library functions. It processes input data for parameter estimation without any suspicious operations. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external communication. The methods are straightforward and follow typical statistical modeling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for statistical modeling of gamma distributions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical application code segment for data fitting.",
