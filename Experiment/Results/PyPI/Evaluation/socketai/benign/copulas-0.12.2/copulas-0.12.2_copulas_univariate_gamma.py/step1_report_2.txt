  "purpose": "Define a univariate Gamma distribution model wrapper for statistical fitting and analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements, specifically 'np', 'gamma', and class definitions, especially methods '_fit_constant', '_fit', '_is_constant', '_extract_constant'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly—no data is sent over network, written to files, or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "Input data 'X' is used within '_fit_constant' and '_fit' methods for parameter estimation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class wrapping scipy's gamma distribution for univariate analysis. Methods for fitting parameters and handling constant data are standard and do not perform any suspicious operations. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious logic is evident. The code appears to be a typical statistical wrapper without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a statistical model wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It only performs mathematical fitting operations on input data.",
