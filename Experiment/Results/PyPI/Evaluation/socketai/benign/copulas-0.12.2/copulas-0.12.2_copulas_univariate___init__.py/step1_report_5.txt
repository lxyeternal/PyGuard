{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module for univariate copulas, importing various univariate distribution classes from the copulas library and setting up an export list.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'copulas.univariate' package, specifically various univariate distribution classes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code only imports and defines an __all__ list without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only contains import statements and an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes from the copulas.univariate package and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is standard for a Python module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The module appears to be a benign, standard setup for a Python package's submodule, with no malicious activity or security issues detected.",
