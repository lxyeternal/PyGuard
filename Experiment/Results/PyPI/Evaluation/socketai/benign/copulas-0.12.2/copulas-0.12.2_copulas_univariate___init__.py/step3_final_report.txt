  "purpose": "This module imports various univariate copula classes and defines an export list for public API.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the 'copulas.univariate' package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input/output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static imports and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports specific classes and defines an __all__ list. There are no functions, data processing, or external data sources. The code is static, clear, and standard for module setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The reports confirm the benign nature, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as an import/export configuration for the package.",
