  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing randomness, object instantiation, argument storage, and data validation.",
  "sources": "Random state management functions, object instantiation functions, argument storage, data validation.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. No network or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input validation occurs in `validate_random_state` and `check_valid_values`. Object creation via `get_instance`. Random state management via context manager and decorator.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries with no obfuscated code or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily offers utility functions for randomness control, object instantiation, argument preservation, and data validation. It employs standard practices such as context managers and decorators, and performs input validation without unsafe operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns were identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be benign utility code designed to facilitate randomness management, object creation, argument storage, and data validation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code.",
