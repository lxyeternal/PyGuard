  "purpose": "Utility functions for randomness control, dynamic object instantiation, argument storage, and data validation.",
  "sources": "Input data for functions like validate_random_state, get_instance, and vectorize; environment variables or external inputs if used improperly.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in get_instance if module names or class names are user-controlled, leading to dynamic import execution.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., strings for module/class names) flow into get_instance, which performs dynamic import and instantiation; data validation functions process datasets; decorators wrap functions to control randomness or handle inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module() with string inputs that could be user-controlled; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network/file operations; code is straightforward with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions with standard patterns. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are evident. The dynamic import pattern in get_instance could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but this is a common pattern in plugin architectures. The functions for randomness, argument storage, and validation are well-structured and do not contain vulnerabilities. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to the dynamic import pattern which requires cautious use with untrusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or malware. The only consideration is the dynamic import, which should be used with validated inputs to prevent misuse. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe for use in standard environments.",
