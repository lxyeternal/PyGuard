  "purpose": "Manage and load plugin add-ons for the Copulas package.",
  "sources": "Import statements, entry_points() function, and dynamic attribute setting within _find_addons().",
  "targets": "sys.modules, addon_target, and addon_name variables where data is dynamically loaded and assigned.",
  "flows": "entry_points() loads add-ons; _get_addon_target() determines where to attach add-ons; setattr() assigns add-ons to target objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports and attribute assignment; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity; exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads modules via entry_points(), which could be manipulated if the environment's entry points are maliciously configured. The functions _get_addon_target() and _find_addons() handle plugin discovery and registration. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The code relies on standard Python features for plugin management. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected. The logic appears consistent with plugin loading procedures, and no suspicious or malicious actions are immediately apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This script manages plugin loading in a standard manner, with no clear indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of dynamic import and attribute setting is typical for plugin systems and not inherently malicious. Risks could exist if environment configurations are compromised, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious intent.",
