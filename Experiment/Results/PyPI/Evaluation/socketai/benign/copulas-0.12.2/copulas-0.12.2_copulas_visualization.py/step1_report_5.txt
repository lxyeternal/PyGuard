{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization utilities for plotting 1D, 2D, and 3D data, including comparison plots between real and synthetic datasets, primarily using Plotly.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pandas DataFrame or Series objects, including data passed to plotting functions and columns specified for plotting.",
  "sinks": "The code generates Plotly figures, which may include data from sources. No direct sinks such as network transmission or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from pandas DataFrame/Series inputs through internal functions to visualization figure objects; no external data sinks or transmissions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard libraries and functions, and no unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script contains utility functions for data visualization, using well-known libraries (pandas, plotly). Data is taken from pandas objects, processed minimally, and visualized via plotly functions. The functions do not perform any network operations, file I/O outside plotting, or access sensitive data. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor mechanisms are detected. The code is well-structured, follows standard patterns, and appears to be intended solely for visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It reads data from input pandas objects and generates plots without performing any harmful actions. It appears safe for use in its intended purpose.",
