{
  "purpose": "Provides visualization utilities for data analysis and comparison, specifically using Plotly to generate various plots such as distribution, scatter, and 3D scatter plots for real and synthetic data.",
  "sources": "Imports pandas for data handling, and plotly.express and plotly.figure_factory for visualization. No external data sources or user inputs are directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Returns Plotly figure objects for visualization; no data is sent over networks or written to files. No use of system commands or environment variables, and no untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Data is passed to plotting functions, which then generate visualization figures. The code processes pandas DataFrames or Series but does not execute or modify the data in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or dynamic execution observed. No external inputs or outputs that could be exploited.",
  "analysis": "The code defines visualization functions with standard usage of pandas and Plotly libraries. All data handling is confined to data passed as arguments, with no external input reads or network communication. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The functions perform typical plotting tasks with appropriate parameter validation and error handling. The code structure and variable usage are clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign visualization utility module that offers plotting functions for data analysis. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
