  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code provides visualization utilities for the Copulas library, generating various plots for data analysis.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code detected. Uses standard libraries (pandas, plotly). No obfuscation or external network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Security risk = 0.0, Confidence = 1.0.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on plotting univariate and bivariate data comparisons.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no external data flow or malicious behavior. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.1 (a minimal, likely conservative estimate).\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Visualization utilities for plotting distributions and comparisons.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious activity. Standard data handling and plotting. No external network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Data visualization functions for univariate, bivariate, and trivariate plots.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no external data handling beyond plotting, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for plotting data distributions and comparisons.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no external network interactions, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is straightforward visualization utility functions, relying on pandas and plotly, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, likely as a conservative estimate due to the possibility of future misuse, but given the current code, this is unwarranted.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or handle secrets.\n- No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.\n- The functions are standard data visualization routines with proper validation.\n- The minimal security risk score (0.1) is acceptable but could be lowered to 0, considering the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.0** — No security issues or vulnerabilities present.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign visualization utility with no security concerns.",
