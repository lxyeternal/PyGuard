{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization utilities for the Copulas library, enabling creation of various plots (density plots, scatter plots, comparison plots) for analyzing data distributions and comparisons between real and synthetic data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pandas DataFrame or Series objects passed to plotting functions; it also reads optional column names and plot titles.",
  "sinks": "The code generates Plotly figures for visualization; it does not write or transmit data externally, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data from pandas DataFrame or Series is processed internally and used to generate Plotly figures; no external data flow or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard plotting library functions with straightforward data processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard visualization libraries (pandas, plotly) and defines multiple functions to generate 1D, 2D, and 3D plots for data analysis. It manipulates pandas DataFrames and Series, appends a 'Data' column to distinguish real and synthetic data in comparison plots, and raises value errors if the number of columns is incompatible for plotting. No code injection, external network calls, or secret data handling is present. The functions perform typical data visualization tasks without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of visualization utilities for plotting data distributions and comparisons. It employs standard libraries with no suspicious or malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or anomalous code. It is safe and intended solely for data visualization within the context of the Copulas library.",
