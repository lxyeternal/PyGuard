{
  "purpose": "Provides visualization utilities for plotting data distributions and comparisons within the Copulas library, including univariate, bivariate, and trivariate plots.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pandas DataFrame or Series objects; accesses data columns for plotting.",
  "sinks": "Generates Plotly figures; no external data transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data is passed into plotting functions, processed locally, and visualized without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Minor in-place modification of input lists in plotting functions could be improved but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard data visualization routines using pandas and Plotly. It performs data validation, constructs various plots, and updates layout and trace properties. No external network calls, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward, with clear purpose and proper use of libraries. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are identified. The minimal security risk score assigned in the original reports (around 0.1) is conservative; given the benign nature, it should be adjusted to 0.0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores appropriately low. The most accurate assessment is a malware score of 0.0, obfuscated score of 0.0, and security risk score of 0.0.",
