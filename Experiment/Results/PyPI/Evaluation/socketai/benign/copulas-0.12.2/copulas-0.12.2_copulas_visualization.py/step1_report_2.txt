{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization utilities for plotting univariate, bivariate, and trivariate data comparisons and distributions, specifically designed for the Copulas library.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pandas DataFrame or Series objects, including copying data for internal modifications.",
  "sinks": "Uses Plotly for rendering plots; no data is sent to external sources or network locations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from pandas objects through plotting functions, which process and visualize them without external network communication or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code relies on standard data handling and plotting libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of functions for creating various plots using Plotly, with clear and standard usage of pandas DataFrames and Series. No untrusted input handling vulnerabilities, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data exfiltration or network activity. The code appears well-structured, with proper parameter validation for column selections, and no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of visualization utilities with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on standard libraries for plotting and data manipulation, with no evidence of backdoors, data leakage, or malware. The overall security risk is minimal.",
