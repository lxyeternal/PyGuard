{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to generate various synthetic datasets for testing or modeling purposes, including bivariate, trivariate, and univariate distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads from random number generators, including scipy.stats distributions and numpy's random functions, often with a specified seed for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, network, or files. No untrusted data output is present.",
  "flows": "Random seed validation and setting functions are used to control the source of randomness; generated data flows through pandas DataFrame/Series objects for downstream use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of _dummy_fn, which is a no-op, appears benign. No suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with functions generating synthetic data from common distributions, controlling randomness with a seed, and returning pandas structures. Usage of external libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy) is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations are present. The presence of _dummy_fn is harmless and used as a placeholder. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign data generation utility for testing or simulation, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues.",
