{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate sample datasets from various univariate and multivariate distributions for use in the Copulas library, primarily for testing or illustrative purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include random number generators (np.random, scipy.stats) with seeds provided for reproducibility; no external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs pandas DataFrames and Series with generated data; no data is written to external systems, network, or files. No sinks pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from seed and distribution parameters through random number generators to in-memory pandas objects. No external or untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs a dummy function '_dummy_fn' with no implementation, which appears unnecessary but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy) and functions for data generation, with controlled seeds for reproducibility. The use of 'set_random_state' and 'validate_random_state' indicates attention to proper random state management. No obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions generate data for testing and are consistent with their documented purposes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for generating sample datasets with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard random data generation techniques and does not perform any harmful actions. The presence of an unused dummy function is benign and likely placeholder code.",
