  "purpose": "Provide functions to generate various synthetic datasets for testing copula models.",
  "sources": "Input is primarily from function arguments (size, seed). Random number generators (np.random, scipy.stats) are used for data generation.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted external data or leak sensitive information; outputs are synthetic datasets.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (size, seed) influence random number generators; generated data flows from these sources into DataFrame or Series objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a dummy function `_dummy_fn`, but it does not execute or modify data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. All functions are standard data generation procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and uses well-known functions for data simulation. The `_dummy_fn` is a no-op placeholder; its presence does not affect security. Use of `set_random_state` and `validate_random_state` suggests controlled random seed handling, reducing unpredictability. No obfuscated or misleading code features are present. No network activity, system commands, or data leaks are evident. The data generation methods are typical for testing, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of data generation functions intended for testing copula models. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
