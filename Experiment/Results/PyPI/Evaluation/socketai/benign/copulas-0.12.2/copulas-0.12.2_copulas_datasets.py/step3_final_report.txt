{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate synthetic datasets for testing copula models, including univariate and multivariate distributions.",
  "sources": "Functions read from standard distribution functions in scipy.stats and numpy.random, and generate data internally without external input.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network communications, or data leaks are present; data is generated and returned locally.",
  "flows": "Data is generated from distributions within each function; no external data flows or untrusted input to sensitive sinks are identified.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of the `_dummy_fn` as a no-op placeholder is noted but harmless; no suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries for data generation, with seed control for reproducibility. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The `_dummy_fn` does nothing and does not influence behavior. The functions produce data from common distributions, and no external communication or secrets are involved. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is appropriately zero. The small security risk score in one report (0.2) is likely an overestimation, given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for synthetic data generation, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The current malware and obfuscation scores are correct; the security risk score should be set to 0 across all reports.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
