      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, experimental Azure Blob Storage recovery tool with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Its destructive capabilities pose operational risks if misused, but these are inherent to recovery functions, not malicious sabotage. The low security risk score of approximately 0.2 accurately reflects this. Proper safeguards and validation are recommended before deployment. Overall, the supply chain security posture is sound, with no malicious activity detected."

The primary concern is the subprocess call to an external editor, which is a standard pattern but could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously manipulated. Overall, the security posture is sound with a very low risk level."
