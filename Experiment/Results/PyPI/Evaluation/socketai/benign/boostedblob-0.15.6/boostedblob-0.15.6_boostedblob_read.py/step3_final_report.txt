{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions for reading data from cloud storage (Azure, Google Cloud) and local files, supporting byte-range reads, full reads, streaming, and unordered streaming.",
  "sources": "Network requests to cloud storage APIs, file open/read operations on local paths",
  "sinks": "Network requests via Request objects, file read operations",
  "flows": "Input data (paths, byte ranges) flow into request construction or file I/O, resulting in data being read or streamed",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard async patterns for cloud and local storage access, with proper handling of byte ranges, streaming, and error conditions. External auth functions are used but are typical. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The request headers and response handling are appropriate. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and align with safe storage access utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for asynchronous storage reading, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the assessments provided.",
