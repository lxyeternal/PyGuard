{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions for deleting files and directories from local and cloud storage (Azure and Google Cloud), supporting globbing and recursive removal.",
  "sources": "Paths obtained from glob_scandir, listtree, and function parameters; network requests via Request objects; filesystem calls os.remove and shutil.rmtree.",
  "sinks": "Network DELETE requests to cloud APIs; filesystem deletion functions; exception handling for file/directory errors.",
  "flows": "Paths are formatted into URLs or filesystem calls, leading to HTTP requests or OS delete functions; error handling manages failures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; potential URL formatting concerns but within expected API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard asynchronous deletion operations across local and cloud storage with proper error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The use of silent request execution and URL formatting is typical for cloud APIs but warrants input validation to prevent URL manipulation. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with legitimate file management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, performs expected deletion functions, and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to URL formatting, which is inherent to cloud API interactions but does not indicate malicious intent.",
