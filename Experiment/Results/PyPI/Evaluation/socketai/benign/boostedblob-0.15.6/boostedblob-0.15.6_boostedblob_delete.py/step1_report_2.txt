{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for removing files and directories from local and cloud storage services, including Azure and Google Cloud Storage, using asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input paths from function arguments, such as 'path' parameters in remove and rmtree functions, and from glob_scandir and listtree functions.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with network requests via the Request class for Azure and Google Cloud APIs, and performs filesystem deletion via os.remove and shutil.rmtree.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input paths to removal functions, which then either execute network requests or local filesystem operations to delete files/directories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious hardcoded data are present. The code performs standard delete operations with proper error handling. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code offers an asynchronous interface for removing files and directories from local and cloud storage. It properly handles exceptions like FileNotFoundError and IsADirectoryError, and uses authentication requests for cloud APIs. The network requests are well-structured, with appropriate success codes and exception handling. The local delete operations are straightforward. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity is apparent. All functions seem aligned with their purpose without any suspicious logic or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of asynchronous file and directory removal supporting cloud and local storage. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs expected operations responsibly with proper error handling.",
