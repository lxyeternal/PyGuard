  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles async uploads to Azure, Google, and local storage, with blob management and error handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. Uses random for upload IDs, but considered safe.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The only minor concern is the randomness for session IDs, which is typical and not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on multipart uploads, concurrency, and standard cloud storage interactions. No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Assessment:** The code is legitimate, with standard practices. Random IDs are acceptable.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, similar functionality, with detailed handling of uploads, block management, and resumable sessions. No backdoors or secret leaks.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears standard, with no malicious payloads.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate upload code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on cloud and local uploads, with standard chunking, retries, and session management. No suspicious features.\n- **Assessment:** Well-structured, no malicious indicators.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar cloud upload logic, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious features.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code is well-structured, with no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Minor points, such as the use of `random.randint()` for upload IDs, are acceptable in this context and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code interacts with external APIs securely, and no secrets are hardcoded.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-obfuscated.\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Given the low but non-zero scores (mostly 0.1–0.2), I would assign a **risk score of approximately 0.1–0.2**, reflecting standard storage handling with minimal risk.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented storage upload utility, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minimal risks are inherent to the nature of cloud interactions and are not indicative of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.15 (average of the reports' scores)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature.",
