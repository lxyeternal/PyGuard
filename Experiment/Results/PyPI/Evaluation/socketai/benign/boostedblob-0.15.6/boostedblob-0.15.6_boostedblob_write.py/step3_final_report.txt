{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous functions for uploading data (single blocks, streams, unordered streams) to cloud storage services (Azure, Google Cloud) and local filesystem, managing multipart uploads, block lists, and resumable uploads.",
  "sources": "External authentication modules (`azure_auth_req`, `google_auth_req`), data streams (`stream` parameters), file paths, and network requests to cloud APIs.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to cloud storage endpoints, file system writes, and HTTP request executions. No data leaks or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data streams are chunked or prepared, then sent via HTTP requests or written to files, with upload IDs generated by `random.randint()`. Error handling and retries are implemented for network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. Use of `random.randint()` for upload IDs is standard but slightly predictable; no malicious payloads or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cloud storage upload operations with proper error handling, chunking, and session management. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of external auth modules and the absence of obfuscated code support a benign assessment. The randomness in upload IDs is typical for session identifiers and does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is well-structured, legitimate, and aligns with common cloud upload patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of cloud and local storage upload utilities with no malicious intent. The scores of malware (0), obfuscated (0), and low security risk (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
