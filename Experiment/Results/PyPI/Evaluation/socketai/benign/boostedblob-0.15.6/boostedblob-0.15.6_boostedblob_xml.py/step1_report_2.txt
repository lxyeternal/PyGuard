{
  "purpose": "Convert a Python dictionary into an XML byte string representation.",
  "sources": "The function reads input data from the 'dictionary' parameter; also conditionally imports XML libraries based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "The code uses 'etree.tostring()' to generate XML output; no external data sinks are present. No untrusted data flow beyond input processing.",
  "flows": "Input 'dictionary' flows through recursive 'inner' function, which constructs XML elements, and the final XML string is produced via 'etree.tostring()'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of 'assert' is standard; no signs of malicious behavior. Conditional import for TYPE_CHECKING is typical for type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code safely converts a dictionary into XML. It uses standard libraries, with a fallback to 'lxml.etree'. The recursive construction properly handles nested dicts and lists. No external network calls, no secret leaks, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard dictionary-to-XML conversion without malicious intent. It does not contain malware, suspicious side effects, or security risks beyond normal operation.",
