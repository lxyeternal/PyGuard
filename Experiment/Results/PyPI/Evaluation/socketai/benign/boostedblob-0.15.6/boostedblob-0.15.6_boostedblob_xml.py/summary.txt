  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for dictionary-to-XML conversion. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'assert' and conditional imports are typical and do not pose security risks. The overall security risk score should be very low (~0.1), malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0."
