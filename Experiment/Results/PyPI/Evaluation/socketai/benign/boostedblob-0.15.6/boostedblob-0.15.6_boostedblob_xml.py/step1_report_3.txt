{
  "purpose": "Convert a dictionary with a single root key into an XML document serialized as bytes.",
  "sources": "Input: the 'dictionary' parameter passed to dict_to_xml; the module imports 'etree' from either xml.etree.ElementTree or lxml.etree depending on type checking.",
  "sinks": "etree.tostring() outputs the generated XML bytes; no other sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The dictionary input flows into the inner() recursive function, which constructs XML elements, ultimately leading to the etree.tostring() output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assert statement for type assumption, which could be disabled in optimized mode; conditional import of XML libraries is standard, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code safely converts a dictionary to XML, handling nested dicts and lists, with proper validation for a single root key. No untrusted data is read directly from external sources; the only data flow is from function parameters to XML output. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The use of standard XML libraries and straightforward logic indicates no malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard dictionary-to-XML serialization without any malicious activity or security risks. It has no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors, and no obfuscation or malware is present.",
