  "purpose": "Convert a dictionary to an XML byte string with a single root element.",
  "sources": "Input is a Python dictionary passed to the dict_to_xml function.",
  "sinks": "The function uses lxml.etree to generate XML and convert it to bytes; no external sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary flows through recursive inner() function, which builds XML elements; final XML string is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Uses standard XML generation libraries. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports XML libraries, choosing between xml.etree.ElementTree and lxml.etree, based on TYPE_CHECKING. The dict_to_xml function enforces a single root element. It employs a recursive inner() function to handle nested dictionaries and lists, building XML elements accordingly. The code appears to perform a standard transformation of dictionary data into XML format. No suspicious or malicious code is present; the use of lxml.etree is typical for XML processing. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dictionary-to-XML converter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs common libraries and patterns, with proper handling of nested structures. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
