  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for file management in cloud storage, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The primary concern is the subprocess call to an external editor, which is a standard pattern but could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously manipulated. Overall, the security posture is sound with a very low risk level."
