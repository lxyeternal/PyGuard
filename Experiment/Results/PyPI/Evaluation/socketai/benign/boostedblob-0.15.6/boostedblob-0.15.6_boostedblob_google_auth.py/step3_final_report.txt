{
  "purpose": "The code manages Google Cloud credentials, handles token acquisition, and generates signed URLs for Google Cloud Storage objects, facilitating secure access.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS', 'APPDATA', 'HOME'), loads credential files, interacts with Google metadata server, and cryptographically signs JWTs.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Google endpoints (metadata server, OAuth token endpoints), cryptographic signing functions, and URL generation for storage objects.",
  "flows": "Credential data from environment variables or files → cryptographic signing of JWTs → token retrieval or URL signing requests → signed URL output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; cryptography uses standard libraries; network interactions are with official Google services; code is clear and non-obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard credential management, token handling, and URL signing for Google Cloud Storage. It uses well-established cryptographic libraries and interacts only with legitimate Google endpoints. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The private key is used solely for signing, and network requests are to official services. The code is readable and follows best practices for such tasks. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the inherent sensitivity of private key handling, but no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for Google Cloud credential management and signed URL creation. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the sensitive nature of private key handling but no actual vulnerabilities.",
