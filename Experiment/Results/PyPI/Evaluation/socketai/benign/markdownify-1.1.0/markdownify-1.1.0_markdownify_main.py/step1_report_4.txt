{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for converting HTML content to Markdown format using the markdownify library.",
  "sources": "Input is read from a specified HTML file or standard input (stdin). No other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs the converted Markdown to standard output (stdout). There are no direct sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that affects system security or leaks information.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data flows from stdin or a file into the markdownify function, then the output Markdown is printed to stdout. No untrusted data is used in a manner that could cause harm or data leaks beyond normal input/output handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior such as network communication, system modification, or credential handling are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines a command-line interface that takes HTML input and processes it through the markdownify library with configurable options. It uses standard argument parsing and calls an external library function. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code appears clean, straightforward, and safe. The imported library 'markdownify' is a third-party dependency; assuming it is reputable, the code itself does not introduce malicious behavior. The options provide flexibility but do not process untrusted data in a manner that would pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe CLI wrapper around the markdownify library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. Its design is typical for a command-line utility for format conversion. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
