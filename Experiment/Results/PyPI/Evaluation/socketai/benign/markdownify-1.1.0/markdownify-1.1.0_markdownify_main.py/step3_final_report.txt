  "purpose": "A command-line utility that converts HTML input into Markdown format using the 'markdownify' library, with various configurable options.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML data from a file specified as an argument or from standard input.",
  "sinks": "Passes the HTML data to the external 'markdownify' function for processing; outputs the converted Markdown to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data flows from the file or stdin into 'markdownify', then the output is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs argument parsing and invokes an external trusted library to convert HTML to Markdown. It does not execute external commands, handle sensitive data insecurely, or perform network operations. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Given the absence of suspicious behaviors, the data flow is benign, and the external library is assumed reputable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI wrapper around a trusted library for HTML to Markdown conversion. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores should reflect a safe status with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score around 0.1 due to its utility nature.",
