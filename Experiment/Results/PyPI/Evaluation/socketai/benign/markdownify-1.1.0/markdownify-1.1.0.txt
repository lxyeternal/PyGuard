      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe HTML to Markdown converter with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the handling of untrusted HTML content that could embed malicious URLs, but this is standard for such utilities. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in security-sensitive environments, provided the output is handled with standard URL validation if necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI wrapper around a trusted library for HTML to Markdown conversion. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores should reflect a safe status with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score around 0.1 due to its utility nature."
