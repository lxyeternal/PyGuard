  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the given assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive, safe HTML-to-Markdown converter. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no malware.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs string and HTML processing without network or system commands. The regex patterns are for text normalization, not malicious purposes.  \n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusions are justified. The low security risk score is appropriate.  \n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1—safe, standard conversion utility. No malicious code, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code does not execute external commands or perform unsafe operations. The regex patterns are for text normalization.  \n- **Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code.  \n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Converts HTML to Markdown, with potential concern about URLs in attributes like 'href', 'src', 'title'.  \n- **Potential concern:** The methods like `convert_a`, `convert_img`, `convert_video` embed attribute values directly into Markdown syntax.  \n- **Analysis:** While these attributes could contain malicious URLs, the code itself does not execute or fetch these URLs. It merely incorporates attribute values into strings.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Justification for scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (no code execution or network activity).  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 is reasonable because embedding untrusted URLs could be a vector for phishing or malicious links if the output is used elsewhere without sanitization. However, the code itself does not perform malicious actions.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is cautious but accurate.  \n\n**Recommendation:** The malware score remains 0. The securityRisk score could be slightly increased to 0.3 if considering that URLs could be malicious, but given the code's nature, 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—safe, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code only processes and formats strings, with no network or code injection.  \n- **Verdict:** Justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Converts HTML to Markdown, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code handles untrusted input safely, with no external calls or code execution.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions or code execution.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, with some cautiousness about embedding URLs from untrusted sources. Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, readable code.  \n**Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — considering URL embedding, but overall low.\n\n**Justification:** The code is a standard HTML to Markdown converter, with no network, code execution, or obfuscation. The only potential concern is untrusted URL embedding, which is inherent to such converters but does not constitute malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- The scores are justified.  \n- No significant changes are necessary.  \n- The overall security posture of this code is very good, with minimal risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep scores as they are, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2.",
