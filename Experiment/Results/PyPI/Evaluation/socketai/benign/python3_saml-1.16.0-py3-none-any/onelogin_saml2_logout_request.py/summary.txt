  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard, and secure implementation of a SAML Logout Request handler. No malicious activity, sabotage, or suspicious behavior is detected. The decryption process and validation steps are appropriate and follow protocol standards. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical cryptographic operations with external keys. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments with proper key management."
