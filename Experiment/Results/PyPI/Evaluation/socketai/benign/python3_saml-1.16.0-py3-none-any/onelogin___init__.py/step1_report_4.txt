  "purpose": "The code provides documentation and description for a Python library that adds SAML support for single sign-on (SSO) and single logout (SLO) functionalities in Python applications.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in the code snippet.",
  "targets": "No data is being output or transmitted; the code is purely descriptive documentation.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input, or output flows present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a comment block describing the library's capabilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a UTF-8 encoding declaration followed by a multi-line comment block that describes the features and support provided by a SAML Python toolkit library. There is no executable code, no data handling, no dynamic behavior, and no potential security risks or malicious indicators within this snippet. It is purely informational documentation. Since there are no functions, classes, or logic, there are no sources, sinks, or data flows to analyze for security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a descriptive comment block outlining the features of a SAML support library. It contains no executable code, data handling, or suspicious behavior. Therefore, it poses no security threat or malware risk.",
