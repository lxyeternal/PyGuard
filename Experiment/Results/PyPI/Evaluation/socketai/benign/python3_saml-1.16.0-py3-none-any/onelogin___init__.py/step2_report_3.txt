  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Code or Logic**: All reports confirm that the provided snippet is purely documentation—comments and docstrings—with no executable code, functions, or data processing. This means there are no actual code flows, sources, sinks, or data handling that could be exploited.\n\n2. **Malicious Elements or Anomalies**: Since the content is only descriptive comments, there are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The reports consistently agree on this point.\n\n3. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable code or malicious indicators.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified because documentation alone cannot pose security risks.\n\n4. **Analysis of Reasoning and Logic**:\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the snippet is purely descriptive.\n   - No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code content.\n   - The high confidence levels (1 and 1.0) are justified, as the content is straightforward documentation with no hidden or malicious elements.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - Since these are only documentation comments, they cannot contain malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n   - If the actual implementation files (not provided here) contain executable code, then security analysis would need to be revisited. But based solely on this snippet, there are no issues.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: the code is purely documentation with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code fragment presents no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a safe, documentation-only snippet with no security implications.",
