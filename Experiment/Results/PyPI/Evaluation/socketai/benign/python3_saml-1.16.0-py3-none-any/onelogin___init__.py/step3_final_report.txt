{
  "purpose": "This code provides descriptive documentation for a Python SAML toolkit library, outlining its features and capabilities.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code contains only comments and docstrings describing the library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no executable code or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist due to the absence of executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is purely documentation with no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a multi-line docstring describing the SAML Python toolkit's features. No functions, classes, or executable statements are present. All reviews correctly identify that this is non-executable documentation with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code and the lack of any suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely descriptive documentation for a SAML Python toolkit library, posing no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns. The scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
