{
  "purpose": "To provide a Python library for adding SAML support to applications, enabling functionalities such as Single Sign-On (SSO), Single Logout (SLO), and metadata handling for service providers.",
  "sources": "No specific data input sources; the code only contains comments and documentation strings describing library features.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code does not process or handle external input or output directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present; the code is purely descriptive and does not execute any data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only descriptive comments without executable code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a file encoding declaration and a detailed docstring explaining the library's features and supported functionalities. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. Since it is purely documentation, it does not present any security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. There are no sources or sinks, nor flow paths, to analyze for vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-executable descriptive comment block outlining the purpose and features of a SAML support library. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior, serving solely as documentation or a header comment.",
