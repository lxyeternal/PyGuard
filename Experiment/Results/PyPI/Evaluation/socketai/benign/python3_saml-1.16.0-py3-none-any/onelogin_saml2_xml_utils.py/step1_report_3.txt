  "sources": [
    "Reading XML schema files from the 'schemas' directory",

    "Extracting data from XML using XPath queries"

  "sinks": [
    "Returning or converting XML data to strings",
    "Validating XML against schemas, which involves parsing XML data",
    "XPath query execution which could process untrusted data",
    "Reading schema files from disk"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input XML data -> to_etree() -> validation or XPath extraction",
    "Input schema filename -> schema file read -> validation",
    "XML data -> to_string() -> output string",
    "XML string -> extract_tag_text() -> substring extraction"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, tokens, or secrets found",
    "No use of dangerous eval or dynamic code execution",
    "Schema files are read from local filesystem; no external fetching or network activity",
    "No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed",
    "Error messages printed in debug mode, but no untrusted data handling here"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard XML utility class for SAML processing. It handles parsing, serializing, schema validation, and XPath queries in a controlled manner. The validation function reads schema files locally and validates XML accordingly. XML data is parsed from strings or bytes, and outputs are returned as strings or XML elements. No dynamic code execution, external network access, or suspicious data handling mechanisms are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The debug printing could leak error details if enabled but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured XML utility class for SAML operations with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs safe parsing, validation, and extraction, with no apparent security risks or malicious features.",
