  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for handling, parsing, validating, and manipulating XML documents in the context of SAML processing.",
  "sources": "Reading XML data from strings, bytes, and files; reading schema files from disk.",
  "sinks": "Potential serialization output, XML validation errors, XPath queries.",
  "flows": "Input XML data -> Parsing/validation functions -> XPath queries or serialization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors. Namespace cleanup includes keeping specific prefixes but this is standard XML handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages XML documents related to SAML assertions, including parsing, validation against schemas, namespace cleanup, and XPath querying. It reads schema files from disk for validation, but this is standard for XML validation. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions perform expected XML operations and handle errors with simple returns or exceptions. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is detected. The code uses safe XML processing practices with schema validation and namespace cleanup. Overall, it appears as legitimate utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of XML handling utilities for SAML processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations safely and appropriately. No malicious or sabotage activities are detected.",
