{
  "purpose": "Constructs and provides a SAML Authentication Request XML, with options for customization, encoding, and deflation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include settings (get_sp_data, get_idp_data, get_security_data), organization data, and optional parameters (force_authn, is_passive, name_id_value_req).",
  "sinks": "Uses encoding functions (base64, deflate) and inserts data into XML templates; no direct unsafe sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data (settings, options) is processed and embedded into XML templates; encoding functions process the assembled XML for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code builds a SAML AuthNRequest XML document, incorporating input parameters and settings. It uses utility functions for time parsing, ID generation, and encoding. No suspicious patterns, such as hardcoded credentials or malicious data handling, are present. The data flow is straightforward, converting input data into a standardized XML format with encoding for transmission. No external network calls, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation for creating SAML authentication requests. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided content.",
