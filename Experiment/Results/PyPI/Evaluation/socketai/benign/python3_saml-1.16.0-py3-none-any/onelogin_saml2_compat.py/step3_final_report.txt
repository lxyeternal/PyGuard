{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for string and byte conversions across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; operates on passed data within functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; functions return converted data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into conversion functions which process and return data; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard compatibility code with clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version and defines functions (utf8, to_string, to_bytes) accordingly for string/byte conversions. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, standard boilerplate. No suspicious or malicious elements are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect this. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
