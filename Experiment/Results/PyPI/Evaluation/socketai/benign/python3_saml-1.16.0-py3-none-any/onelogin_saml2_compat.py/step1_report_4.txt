{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility functions for handling text and byte strings across Python 2.x and 3.x.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines functions and type checks based on the environment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The functions convert data types between unicode/str and bytes, but do not process untrusted external data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed. The code performs standard compatibility adjustments without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines compatibility variables and functions to handle string and byte conversions between Python 2 and Python 3. It uses version checks and type assertions to determine the environment, then defines functions accordingly. There are no external data sources, no sinks that could leak data, and no control flow that manipulates data in an insecure manner. The code is a common pattern for cross-version compatibility libraries, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility utility for handling string types across Python versions. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
