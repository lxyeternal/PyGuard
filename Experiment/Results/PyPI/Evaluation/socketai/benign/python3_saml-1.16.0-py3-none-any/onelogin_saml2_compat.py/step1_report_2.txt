{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility functions for Python 2 and Python 3 regarding string and byte handling.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; functions operate on input parameters which are data variables passed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or untrusted data handling observed within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; functions process input data but do not transfer data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes compatibility handling for different Python versions but contains no obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "This code implements version detection for Python 2 and 3 and defines utility functions (utf8, to_string, to_bytes) for string and byte conversions. It uses standard practices for compatibility, with no suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No external inputs are read or untrusted data sources processed; the functions are straightforward utility implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a compatibility layer without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
