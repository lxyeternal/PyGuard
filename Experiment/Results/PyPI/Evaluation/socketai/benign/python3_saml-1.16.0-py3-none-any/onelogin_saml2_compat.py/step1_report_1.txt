  "purpose": "Provide compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3 regarding string and byte handling.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code defines functions and checks data types.",
  "sinks": "None present; functions return converted data types.",
  "flows": "Data type conversions within functions such as utf8, to_string, and to_bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward compatibility boilerplate with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes compatibility between Python 2 and 3 for string handling, defining functions to encode/decode data as UTF-8. It uses conditional checks to assign appropriate functions and types based on the Python version detected. There are no external inputs, untrusted data flows, or suspicious logic present. The functions operate solely on provided data, performing standard type conversions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard compatibility boilerplate aimed at ensuring consistent string handling across Python versions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
