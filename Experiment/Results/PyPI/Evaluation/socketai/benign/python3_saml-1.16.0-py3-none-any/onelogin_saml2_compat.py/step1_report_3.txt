  "purpose": "Provides Python 2 and 3 compatibility for string and byte handling.",
  "sources": "Imports __future__ for compatibility features; uses isinstance checks to determine Python version.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Type checks determine flow paths for string and byte conversions based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard compatibility pattern with no obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for handling string and byte conversions across Python 2 and 3. It uses version detection to assign appropriate functions and types. There are no external inputs, network calls, or data processing that could be exploited. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a standard compatibility layer without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard Python compatibility utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
