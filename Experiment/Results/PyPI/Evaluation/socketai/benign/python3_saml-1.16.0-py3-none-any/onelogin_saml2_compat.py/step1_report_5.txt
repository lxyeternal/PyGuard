{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for handling string and byte conversions between Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "The code reads from input variables 'data' in functions utf8, to_string, and to_bytes.",
  "sinks": "The functions convert data types but do not directly interact with external sources or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the functions where type checking and conversions occur, with no external data sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard compatibility techniques.",
  "analysis": "The script detects Python version and defines utility functions for string and byte conversions accordingly. No external data sources are accessed, and functions only process data passed as arguments. The logic is straightforward, relying on standard Python idioms for version compatibility. There are no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or file manipulations. Overall, the code is purely utility-based for compatibility and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for string and byte handling between Python 2 and 3, with no malicious or security risks detected.",
