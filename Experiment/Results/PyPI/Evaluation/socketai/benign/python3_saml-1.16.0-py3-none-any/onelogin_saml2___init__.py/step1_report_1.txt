  "purpose": "Provide an overview of SAML support and functionalities offered by the Python library for integrating SAML-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Comment block describing library features; no input reading or data sources present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present; no untrusted data handling or output shown.",
  "flows": "No executable code; only descriptive comments are provided, so no data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, parameters, or data handling logic; only documentation comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment block detailing the library's purpose and features. There are no functions, classes, or executable statements present. Since it does not perform any operations, read input, or write output, there are no security concerns related to code execution, data handling, or malicious behavior. This appears to be a docstring or module doc comment meant for documentation purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This source code does not contain any executable code or data handling that could be malicious or insecure. It serves solely as documentation. There are no signs of malware, suspicious flows, or security risks.",
