  "sources": "None; the code contains only comments and documentation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "None; as there is no executable code, no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is purely descriptive comments with no unusual or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a multi-line comment or docstring outlining the features of a SAML Python library. It contains no functions, classes, executable statements, or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign and documentation-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely descriptive documentation with no executable or malicious content. It poses no security threat or malicious intent, and the scores assigned are justified and consistent with its nature.",
