  "purpose": "Provide a Python library to add SAML support for single sign-on and single logout functionalities in Python applications.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input or data reading functions identified in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network transmission, or data processing functions shown.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from source to sink within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a descriptive comment block with no executable code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment block describing the features and capabilities of a SAML Python toolkit library. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. Without actual implementation code, there are no identifiable security risks, malicious behaviors, or anomalies. The description appears standard for a library intended to support SAML authentication, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is purely descriptive documentation without executable content or security-sensitive elements. It poses no security threat or malicious intent based on the provided content.",
