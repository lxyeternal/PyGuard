  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Code and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided code consists solely of descriptive comments/documentation, with no executable code, functions, classes, or data handling.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks; thus, no runtime behavior, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Malware Scores:**\n   - Given the absence of executable code, network activity, or data processing, the malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Flaws:**\n   - Since the code is purely documentation, it cannot introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n   - The reports' security risk scores of 0 are justified.\n\n4. **Scores Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign and purely documentation.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation or executable content.\n   - Overall, the scoring appears consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities, focusing instead on the content's nature as documentation.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n6. **Summary of Analysis:**\n   - The code snippets are purely descriptive comments/documentation.\n   - No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this is just documentation with no executable code or security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates, I would concur with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a safe, non-malicious, purely informational comment block.",
