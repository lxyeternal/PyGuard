{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a SAML toolkit, including error codes and message formatting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; error message formatting with 'message % errors' within class constructors.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data processing or network interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely class definitions with internal message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert isinstance(code, int)' and message formatting with '% errors' could be points of concern if 'errors' is untrusted, but in controlled contexts, safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes with error codes and message formatting. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The message formatting pattern is standard, assuming controlled input. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The use of assertions is acceptable but could be replaced with explicit type checks for robustness. Overall, the code is purely definitional and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as infrastructure for error handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
