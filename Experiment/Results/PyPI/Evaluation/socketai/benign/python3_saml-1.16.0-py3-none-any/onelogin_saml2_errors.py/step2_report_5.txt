  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code defines two custom exception classes with associated error codes and message formatting.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The message formatting using '% errors' could theoretically be exploited if 'errors' contains malicious format specifiers, but in typical usage, this is safe if 'errors' is controlled.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is purely definitional, serving as infrastructure for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, purely class definitions, error codes, and constants.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward class definitions with no external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** The message formatting with '% errors' could be misused if 'errors' contains malicious format specifiers, but in practice, it's a common pattern assuming 'errors' is controlled.\n- **Potential concern:** No actual data processing or external data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; safe.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same as previous; no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others; no dynamic code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is purely definitional.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all, as the code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n**Note on message formatting:** While the use of '% errors' could be a concern if 'errors' contains malicious format specifiers, in the context of exception message formatting, this pattern is common and generally safe if the inputs are controlled. Since these are internal exception classes, and the reports do not indicate any external input handling or dynamic code execution, the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
