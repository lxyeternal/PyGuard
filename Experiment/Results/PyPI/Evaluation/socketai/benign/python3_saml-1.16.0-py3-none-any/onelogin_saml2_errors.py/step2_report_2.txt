  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code only defines two custom exception classes with associated error codes and message formatting.\n   - No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.\n   - The message formatting using `message % errors` is standard, assuming controlled input.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and safe.\n   - They note the use of assertions for type checking, which is acceptable but could be replaced with more explicit type validation for robustness.\n   - The potential concern about message formatting with `% errors` is acknowledged, but in this context, it is safe as long as 'errors' is controlled and validated elsewhere.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - The code is purely for error handling and does not perform any external actions or contain any malicious logic.\n   - Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:\n   - No malware activity detected; the code is purely definitional.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as safe.\n   - The note about message formatting is cautious but correctly identified as safe in this context.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for a SAML toolkit.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The scores and analysis are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.",
