  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes (`OneLogin_Saml2_Error` and `OneLogin_Saml2_ValidationError`) with associated error code constants.\n   - The classes include an `__init__` method that formats messages, potentially with additional error info.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads.\n   - Use of assertions for type checking is standard, not suspicious.\n   - Error message formatting with `% errors` is straightforward; unless `errors` contains malicious format specifiers (which is unlikely in controlled internal error handling), this is safe.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard, safe implementation for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n   - The reports correctly note the absence of external data processing, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code is purely definitional with no security implications.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Points of Caution:**\n   - The only minor point is the message formatting with `% errors`. If `errors` were to contain malicious format specifiers, it could cause issues, but this is unlikely given the context and typical usage.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n   - The code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided reports. The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses no security risk.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are needed.",
