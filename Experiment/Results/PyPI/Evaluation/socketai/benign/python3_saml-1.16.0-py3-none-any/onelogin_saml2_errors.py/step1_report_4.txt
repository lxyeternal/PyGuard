  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors and validation errors in a SAML Python Toolkit.",
  "sources": "None (the code only defines classes and constants).",
  "sinks": "None, as the code does not handle external data input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the classes are for error handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code contains straightforward class definitions with error codes and constructors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, each with a set of error codes and an initializer that formats messages. It does not include any dynamic execution, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated elements. The message formatting using '% errors' is standard and safe, assuming 'errors' is controlled and validated elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks within this code. It serves purely as error handling infrastructure for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a SAML toolkit. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It functions solely to provide structured error handling.",
