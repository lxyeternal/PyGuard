  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code only defines two custom exception classes with associated error codes and message formatting.\n- No external input, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- The message formatting using `% errors` could be a concern if 'errors' contains malicious format specifiers, but this is a common pattern assuming controlled input.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be purely definitional, intended for error handling within a larger SAML toolkit.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The message formatting with `% errors` is safe if 'errors' is controlled, but if untrusted, could lead to format string vulnerabilities. However, in typical usage, this pattern is standard and safe.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is the use of `assert isinstance(code, int)` in constructors. While assertions are useful during development, they can be disabled in production if Python is run with optimization flags (`-O`), potentially skipping type checks. This is a minor concern but not a security issue.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** 0. The code is purely for defining exceptions; no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0. The code does not pose any security risk; it's purely definitional.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No reason to assign higher scores since the code is safe, static, and standard.\n- The only potential concern is the message formatting, but it's a common pattern and not inherently risky unless misused with untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the report conclusions and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes needed. The code is safe and purely for error handling in a larger system.",
