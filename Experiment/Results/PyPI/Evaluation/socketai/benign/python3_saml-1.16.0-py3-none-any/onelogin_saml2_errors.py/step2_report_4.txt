  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, focusing on the presence of issues, correctness of scoring, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exception classes with error codes, no external data processing, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely definitional, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the static nature of error codes and message formatting.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No data handling or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the message formatting with '% errors' but finds no security risk or malicious behavior.\n- **Potential concern:** Using '%' string formatting with external inputs can sometimes lead to injection if not controlled, but here, 'errors' is likely a controlled parameter, and the code does not process untrusted data.\n- **Assessment:** No actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The message formatting is safe given the context.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the straightforward nature and lack of dynamic or external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n- **Scores:** All zero — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the static, safe design of exception classes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** All zero — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** None. The code is purely for defining exception classes and constants.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws detected.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Assumption-based Claims:** No unwarranted assumptions; the code is straightforward.\n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The reports are accurate in their assessments and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If any future context involves dynamic message formatting with untrusted data, a review of message handling might be warranted. But in this static context, the implementation is secure.",
