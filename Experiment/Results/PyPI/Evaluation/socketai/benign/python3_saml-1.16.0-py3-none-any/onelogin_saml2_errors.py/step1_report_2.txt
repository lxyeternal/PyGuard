{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SAML2 error handling and validation errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constants, no input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or outputted, no untrusted data flows or vulnerabilities identified.",
  "flows": "None; as there are no data flows, input to output, or processing of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of standard class definitions with error codes and initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes with predefined error codes and message formatting. It uses assertions to verify input types but does not include any data handling, network operations, or system modifications. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be purely for error handling within a larger SAML toolkit. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error management in a SAML toolkit. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it interact with external systems or untrusted data. It is safe and standard in its design.",
