{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SAML2 errors and validation errors in a Python SAML toolkit.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; internal error messages and error codes are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Error message construction using string formatting with '% errors' when errors are provided, but no user input is directly involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; error codes are statically defined; no obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes with static error codes and a simple message formatting mechanism. No data input, output, or external interactions occur. The use of '% errors' for message formatting could theoretically be misused if 'errors' contains malicious format specifiers, but in this context, it only affects internal error message construction. The code does not perform any network, file, or system operations, nor does it contain obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward, secure implementation of custom error classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It is a simple, static definition of custom exceptions with safe message formatting. No indications of malware, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
