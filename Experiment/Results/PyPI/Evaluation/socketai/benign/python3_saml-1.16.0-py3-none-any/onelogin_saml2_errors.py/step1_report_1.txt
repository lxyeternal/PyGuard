  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SAML error handling and validation errors in a Python toolkit.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines classes and constants without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard class definitions, constants, and exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two custom exception classes with predefined error codes for handling specific errors in a SAML toolkit. It includes constants for different error conditions but does not perform any input processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions. The use of assertions for type checking in constructors is standard. Overall, the code is purely definitional, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is solely for defining custom exception classes and error codes. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and poses no security risk. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for error handling in a Python SAML library.",
