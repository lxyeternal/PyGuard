  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SAML2 error handling, including error codes and initialization logic.",
  "sources": "Constants defining error codes and __init__ methods that accept message, code, and errors parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being used in a way that leads to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, code, errors) flow into exception initialization but are only used for exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The code strictly defines exception classes and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with associated error codes for handling SAML2 validation and configuration errors. It uses standard Python exception patterns, with input validation via assertions and message formatting. There are no signs of code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any data processing or external interactions; it solely manages error representation. Overall, the implementation is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a standard implementation of custom exceptions for SAML2 error handling with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
