  "purpose": "Utilities for defining, managing, and validating ignored subgraphs and scopes within neural network graphs for model compression tasks.",
  "sources": "Node names, patterns, subgraph definitions, graph node attributes, and types.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal data structures and validation functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (node names, patterns, types, subgraphs) flow into matching and validation functions, which process graph data internally.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. License date (2025) appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for managing ignored subgraphs/scopes in neural network graphs. It uses common Python features, regex, and internal logging. No external communication, file I/O, or malicious activity is present. The functions perform matching, conversion, and validation of scope rules against graph data. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. The regex usage is controlled and typical for pattern matching. The license date is likely a placeholder. Overall, the code is benign and intended for internal model analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for neural network graph scope management with no security issues or malware detected. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to regex pattern matching but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
