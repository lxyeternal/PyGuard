{
  "purpose": "This code provides data structures and functions for defining, managing, and validating ignored subgraphs and scopes within a neural network graph, primarily for model compression techniques like pruning and quantization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as node names, patterns, operation types, and subgraph definitions. It also reads graph structures through the NNCFGraph class and its methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any explicit sinks that process untrusted input data into external systems, files, or network communications. It mainly processes internal data structures for graph analysis and validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (node names, patterns, types, subgraphs) through matching functions that analyze these against graph nodes and structures, culminating in validation or returned ignored node names. No external or untrusted data is used to influence external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears well-structured with no suspicious or obfuscated code. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual patterns. The only potential concern is the use of regular expressions for pattern matching, which is standard and safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for subgraph and ignored scope configurations, with methods to extract node names based on scope rules, compare ignored scopes, and validate scope matches within neural network graphs. It uses standard Python libraries and well-defined class methods for processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions focus solely on internal graph analysis and validation, with no external side effects or untrusted data handling outside expected input parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of scope management and validation for neural network graph processing, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs logical matching and validation tasks using safe, standard Python practices.",
