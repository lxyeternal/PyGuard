  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utilities for managing ignored subgraphs/scopes in neural network graphs, primarily for model compression tasks.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The license date (2025) appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **reasonable**.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on matching and validation of ignored scopes.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation. Usage of regex is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — **acceptable**, considering the potential misuse of regex, but still within normal bounds.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score might be slightly conservative but is acceptable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on matching and validation of ignored subgraphs/scopes.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code operates solely on provided graph data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar scope handling code, with detailed matching and validation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. Uses regex safely within context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — **reasonable**.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for ignored scope management, with no external or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior. Use of regex is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — **acceptable**.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score is slightly higher than others, but still reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; **0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; **0** is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and structure, the only minor concern is the use of regex patterns, which could theoretically be exploited if user input is maliciously crafted. However, the code operates on provided parameters and does not execute untrusted code or access external systems.\n\n**Adjusted Risk Scores:**  \n- For all reports, a risk score of **0.1 to 0.2** is appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to regex usage, but overall the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2, depending on the context, but generally low.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility for managing ignored nodes/scopes in neural network graphs, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The current scores are aligned with the code's intent and structure.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (average, considering regex usage)",
