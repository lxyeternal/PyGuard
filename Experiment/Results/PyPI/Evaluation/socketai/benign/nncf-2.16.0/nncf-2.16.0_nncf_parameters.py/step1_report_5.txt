  "purpose": "Defines various enumerations and API markers for neural network compression configuration and precision settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum module, imports from nncf.common.utils.api_marker",
  "sinks": "None of the code sections handle untrusted input data or perform output actions; mainly definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code consists solely of class definitions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of enum classes and API annotations for configuration purposes in a neural network compression framework. There are no functions or logic that handle user input, external data, or perform network or file operations. All classes are purely declarative, defining constant values and metadata for use in other modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or potentially harmful behavior. The license at the top is standard and includes a future year, which might be a typo but does not impact security analysis. Overall, this code is safe and typical for configuration definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of enum and API marker definitions for neural network compression configurations. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks identified. It is a standard configuration module with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
