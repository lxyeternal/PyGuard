  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely static enum definitions with API markers. No dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. The only anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is inconsistent with the license date but likely a typo.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — justified, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the future copyright date as a potential anomaly. No malicious patterns.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — acceptable, given the minor anomaly.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—static enum classes with documentation, no runtime or external data handling. The future date is noted as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; static enums, no dynamic code or external interactions. The future date is again a minor anomaly.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar static enum definitions, no suspicious activity. Slightly higher confidence but still no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 or 0.1 — given the pattern, 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely declarative, defining enums for configuration purposes.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** All reports correctly assign very low or zero risk scores, justified by the static nature and lack of malicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** The future copyright year (2025) appears to be a typo or placeholder, not an attempt at obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, a score of **0** is appropriate. The minor anomaly (future year) does not elevate the risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, static set of configuration enums used within a neural network compression framework. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor issue is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo and not a security concern.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the pattern observed across all reports.",
