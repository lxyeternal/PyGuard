{
  "purpose": "The code defines various enumerations and API markers related to neural network compression, quantization, and device targeting for machine learning models.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is defined as constants within enumerations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions that handle untrusted data or perform output; the code is mainly for configuration and API metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all code is static class and enumeration definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation present. The initial comment incorrectly states the year as 2025, which is inconsistent with the licensing date, but this is likely a typographical error rather than malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enumerations that specify constants for device types, model types, quantization modes, compression formats, backup modes, and sensitivity metrics. These are decorated with an API marker for documentation or runtime use. The code is straightforward, using standard Python enum and class structures, with no input/output handling, network communication, or file operations. The licensing comment, despite the seemingly future date, appears to be a typo or placeholder and not an attempt at obfuscation or malicious intent. No malicious patterns such as code injection, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, static set of enumeration definitions used for model compression and quantization configuration. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the copyright year, which appears to be a typographical error, not a security concern.",
