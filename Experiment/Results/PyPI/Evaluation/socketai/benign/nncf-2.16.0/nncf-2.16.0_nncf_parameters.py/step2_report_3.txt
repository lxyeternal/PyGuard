  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines enums and API markers for device types, model types, quantization modes, etc.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static class and enum definitions; no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The copyright year is 2025, which is inconsistent with the license comment (likely a typo).\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, configuration-only code, no malware or security risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the future copyright date.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1) due to the date anomaly, but not malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: enums and API markers, no runtime or data handling.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment: static enum definitions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others: purely configuration enums, no runtime or external data.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports indicate no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior. The code is static, defining constants and API metadata.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risks:** Minimal; the only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a typo or placeholder, not an attack vector.\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:** No suspicious assumptions are made; all assessments are consistent with the static nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose as configuration enums, the risk is negligible. Slightly elevate from 0 to **0.1** due to the copyright date anomaly, but overall, it remains very low.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**       | **0.1** |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, static set of enumeration definitions for a neural network compression framework. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**Final note:** It is advisable to correct the copyright year for clarity, but this does not affect the security assessment.",
