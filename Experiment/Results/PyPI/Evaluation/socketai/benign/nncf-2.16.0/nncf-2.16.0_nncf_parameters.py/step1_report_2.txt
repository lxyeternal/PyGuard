{
  "purpose": "This code defines various enumeration classes for configuration options related to model compression, quantization, and device targeting within a neural network framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from class definitions, enum attributes, and docstrings. No external input or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code consists solely of static definitions and documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative, defining constants and enums for internal use.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright date set in the future (2025), which is inconsistent with the comment indicating the license and may suggest tampering. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple Enum classes decorated with an API marker, serving as configuration constants for a neural network compression library. No functions, input processing, network connections, or code execution features are included. The presence of future-dated copyright is unusual but does not imply malicious intent; it may be a placeholder or an oversight. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module defining configuration enums for a neural network compression framework. Despite the future copyright date, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured set of definitions intended for internal use.",
