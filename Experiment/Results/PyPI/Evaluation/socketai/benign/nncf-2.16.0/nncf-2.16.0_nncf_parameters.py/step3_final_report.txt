{
  "purpose": "Defines static enumeration classes for device types, model types, quantization modes, compression formats, and related configuration parameters used in neural network compression framework.",
  "sources": "Static class and enum definitions, no data input, no external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely declarative enum and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' appears inconsistent with the license comment, likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward enum classes with associated documentation, no dynamic or executable code, no obfuscation, and no external data handling. The only anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with no malware or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious or security-related.",
