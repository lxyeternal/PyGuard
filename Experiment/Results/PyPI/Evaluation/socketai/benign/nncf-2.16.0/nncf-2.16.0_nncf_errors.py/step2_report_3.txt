  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:  \n   The code solely defines a series of custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings, intended for error handling within the NNCF framework. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The license header appears standard, with a typo in the year (\"2025\" instead of a plausible 2023 or 2024), but that is likely a typo rather than malicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity.\n   - Exception classes are straightforward, static, and only serve to categorize errors.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and purely for error handling.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent are identified.\n   - The only minor note is the license header's year, which is likely a typo and not relevant to security.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or 0.5, with the consensus that this code does not pose a security risk. Since it is just exception class definitions, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted; the code is purely structural.\n   - The only questionable element is the license header's year, but that does not impact security.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n   - No malicious or security risk elements are present.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions for error handling within a Python framework. No issues, risks, or malicious behaviors are present. The current scores are accurate and should remain as such.",
