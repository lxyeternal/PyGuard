  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- All classes have descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose.\n- No data inputs, external calls, network interactions, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The license header is standard, with a future date (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be structured error handling within the NNCF framework.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exceptions for internal and user errors.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion—standard, benign code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes, likely for neural network framework.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; purely class definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes, with a note on the static string in `StatisticsCacheError`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code; the string is static and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to others—error handling classes.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions for exception handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The license date (2025) is unusual but not suspicious.\n- The static string in `StatisticsCacheError` is benign.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n- The code is very straightforward and standard for error handling.\n- No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n- The license date in the future might warrant a review, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Metric             | Score  | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Clear, straightforward class definitions.                    |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No security issues or vulnerabilities detected.              |\n\n**Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code is negligible.**",
