  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of defining custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings.\n- No data input, external data reading, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The license header appears standard, with a typo in the year (2025), but this is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code is straightforward, static class definitions for error handling.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The purpose is clear: structured error reporting within the NNCF framework.\n- No suspicious patterns, external dependencies, or risky constructs.\n\n### Potential Issues or Flaws:\n- The only minor concern is the license year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to current dates. This suggests a placeholder or typo, but it does not impact security or functionality.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and well-documented.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities are present.\n\nThe reports uniformly agree on these points, assigning a confidence of 1, and correctly noting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is standard, benign, and safe.\n- No modifications needed to the scores.\n- The only correction might be to update the license year if it's a typo, but that doesn't affect security.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
