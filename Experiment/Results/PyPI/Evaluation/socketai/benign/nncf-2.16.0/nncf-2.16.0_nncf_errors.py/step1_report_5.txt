  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions within the NNCF framework.",
  "sources": "No external input sources detected; all classes are definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no runtime data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all classes are straightforward exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious activity detected. The purpose is to facilitate error handling within a framework, and it contains no network, file, or environment interactions. The code appears to be standard, safe, and intentionally structured for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured exception classes intended for internal use in the framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks. It is safe and benign.",
