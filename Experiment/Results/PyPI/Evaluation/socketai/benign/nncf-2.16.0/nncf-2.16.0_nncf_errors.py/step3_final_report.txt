{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes intended for error handling within the NNCF framework, providing structured error reporting and categorization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only through class definitions and docstrings; no external data, user input, or dynamic data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code contains only static class definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static class declarations with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with descriptive docstrings. The license header contains a future year (2025), which appears to be a typo or placeholder, but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings, serving as structured error categories for the framework. There are no data inputs, external calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The static nature and simplicity indicate no obfuscation or malicious intent. The license header's future date is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern. Overall, the code is benign, standard, and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling within the framework. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
