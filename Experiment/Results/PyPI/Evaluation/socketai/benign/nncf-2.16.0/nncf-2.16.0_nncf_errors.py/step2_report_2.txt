  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: None involving data input/output; purely class definitions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes with descriptive docstrings. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (possibly conservative, but acceptable given the benign nature).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same observations as Report 1.\n- Conclusion: Also benign, standard exception classes.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar findings: straightforward class definitions, no external data or dynamic behavior.\n- Slight note: the string in `StatisticsCacheError` is static and harmless.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard exception classes.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code only defines exception classes.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No code execution, external data, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code is purely structural and does not process or handle untrusted data.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Since this is purely exception class definitions, there is no reason to assign higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for error handling within the NNCF framework. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation are justified, and the risk score of zero reflects the absence of security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The supply chain security risk for this code is minimal and non-existent based on the provided analysis.",
