{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions within a framework, likely related to neural network compression or validation.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; all are class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely class and exception definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with docstrings explaining their purpose. No input reading, data processing, network connections, or any other potentially malicious activity is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The structure is simple, static, and typical for a Python project related to machine learning or neural network frameworks. No suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of custom exception classes for error handling in a framework. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, safe, and non-malicious.",
