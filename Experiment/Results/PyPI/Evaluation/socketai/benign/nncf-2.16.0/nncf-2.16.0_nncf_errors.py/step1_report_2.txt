  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the NNCF framework.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code consists solely of class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines a set of custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings for use within the NNCF framework. There are no data inputs, network operations, environment variable usage, or dynamic code execution. The license header appears standard, and the code structure is typical for exception class definitions. No indicators of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling, with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
