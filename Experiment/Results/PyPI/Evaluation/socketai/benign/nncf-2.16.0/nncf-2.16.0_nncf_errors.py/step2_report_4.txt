  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the context, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a set of custom exception class definitions for the NNCF framework.\n- It contains no data processing, network activity, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is static, straightforward, with clear docstrings.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n#### **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- The code only defines exception classes with descriptive docstrings.\n- No input reading, external data handling, or code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n- The license header appears standard, with a typo in the year (2025), but that’s a minor issue and not security-related.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n#### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no external interactions.\n- They consistently note the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**No flaws** in the reasoning are apparent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Scores and Justifications**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Any deviation from these scores would be unreasonable.**  \nThe code is clearly safe.\n\n---\n\n#### **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code only defines exception classes.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Assessment\nConsidering all points:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling within a Python framework.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and free of security issues. The reports are accurate and justified in their conclusions.",
