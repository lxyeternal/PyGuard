  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the NNCF framework.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely establishes exception classes for internal use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; all classes are straightforward exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with docstrings explaining their use. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs. The exception classes are standard and do not contain dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external communication. The only potentially noteworthy element is the string message in the 'StatisticsCacheError' class, but it is a static string with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a framework. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
