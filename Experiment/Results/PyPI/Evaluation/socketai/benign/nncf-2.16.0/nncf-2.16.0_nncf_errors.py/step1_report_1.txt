{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the NNCF framework, facilitating clear error reporting for various internal and user-related issues.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; it solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, as the code only declares exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists involving untrusted input; the code only establishes exception types for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors present. The code consists entirely of class definitions for exceptions with straightforward docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class. Each class includes descriptive docstrings explaining the circumstances under which it should be raised. There are no data inputs, network interactions, or code execution components. The code appears standard for setting up structured error handling within a framework. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The consistent structure and clear documentation suggest legitimate use for error reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for a Python framework. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It simply provides a structured way to handle errors within the framework.",
