{
  "purpose": "This script manages dynamic version generation during package build, reading version info from a file, environment variables, and Git, and optionally rewriting the version file based on build context.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from nncf/version.py; accesses environment variables NNCF_RELEASE_BUILD, NNCF_BUILD_SUFFIX, _PYPROJECT_HOOKS_BUILD_BACKEND; executes Git commands to get commit hash and repository status.",
  "sinks": "Modifies nncf/version.py when environment variables trigger rewriting; uses subprocess to run Git commands, but no untrusted network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> checks environment variables -> runs Git commands -> constructs version string -> optionally rewrites version.py based on environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess with suppress to hide errors, which could mask failures; modifies version.py dynamically based on environment variables, potentially manipulated in malicious environments but standard in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version management tasks for Python packaging, including reading version info, executing Git commands, and conditional file rewriting. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The subprocess calls are typical for such scripts, and the suppression of errors could hide failures but does not introduce malicious behavior. The environment variables used are common in build contexts and could be exploited if manipulated, but this is a known risk rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build utility for dynamic versioning, with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The potential security risks are typical for build scripts relying on environment variables and version control state, and do not constitute malicious behavior.",
