  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the validity of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code reads environment variables, version files, and executes Git commands to generate dynamic version strings.\n- It conditionally rewrites the version file (`nncf/version.py`) based on environment variables.\n- Uses subprocess with suppressed exceptions, which could hide errors but is common in build scripts.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or direct malicious payloads are present.\n- The code's purpose aligns with standard version management in build pipelines.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard versioning script, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Comments:** The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable given the code's nature. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the standard nature of the script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) due to potential manipulation via environment variables or file modifications, but still minimal. The malware score remains justified at 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports; describes typical versioning behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Comments:** Appropriately low risk and malware scores. The slight risk is due to environment manipulation, which is standard in build scripts.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar assessment; notes the use of subprocess and file modifications.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Comments:** The risk score reflects potential manipulation points but remains low. Malware remains at 0, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, a standard versioning utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Comments:** Consistent with other reports; the risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, reflecting the potential for environment-based manipulation but not actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — 0.2 — low, typical for build scripts that depend on environment variables and version control states.\n\n**Note:** The code's behavior is typical for version management in build pipelines, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' assessments are accurate and appropriately conservative. The code is a standard, non-malicious versioning utility with minimal security risk, primarily related to environment manipulation, which is common in such scripts.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No further action needed.",
