  "purpose": "Define directory paths and environment variable names for configuration and environment detection in a Python project.",
  "sources": "os.path functions for directory paths, Path.home() for cache directory, environment variable names for CI and dev environment detection",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks; only setting up configuration variables and paths",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and paths",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) which appears to be a placeholder or typo, not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward setup code defining paths and environment variable names using standard libraries. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. The only unusual aspect is the future date in the comment, which is likely a placeholder. No secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of malicious logic, obfuscation, or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
