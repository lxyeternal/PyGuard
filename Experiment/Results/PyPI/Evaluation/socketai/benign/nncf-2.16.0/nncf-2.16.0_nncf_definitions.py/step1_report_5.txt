  "purpose": "Define configuration paths and environment variables for the NNCF package setup and environment detection.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables ('NNCF_CI', 'NNCF_DEV'), determining file system paths using os and pathlib modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is sent externally or written insecurely.",
  "flows": "Environment variable checks or path assignments, which are standard configuration steps with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward configuration setup without obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, sets directory paths based on current file location and home directory, and defines environment variable names for environment detection. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling beyond simple path and variable assignments. All variables are set using safe standard library functions, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup script, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It only defines paths and environment variable names for use elsewhere.",
