  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward configuration code: defining paths and environment variable names.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, no network operations, no secret handling.\n   - The environment variables are used solely for configuration detection (CI or dev environment flags).\n   - The code does not manipulate environment variables, nor does it perform any suspicious actions.\n\n2. **Anomalies and Inconsistencies:**\n   - The only anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or a typo, not malicious.\n   - No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n   - The reasoning that this code is benign and purely configuration is sound.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code only sets up paths and environment variable names, it does not perform any actions that could pose security risks.\n   - The use of environment variables for environment detection is standard practice.\n   - No indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign configuration snippet with no security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
