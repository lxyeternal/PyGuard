  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines constants for directory paths and environment variable names.\n- It uses standard Python libraries (`os`, `pathlib`) for path and environment handling.\n- The environment variables (`NNCF_CI`, `NNCF_DEV`) are intended for environment detection (CI, development).\n- The copyright date is set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing from untrusted sources.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- **Malware:** The code does not perform any malicious actions. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Security Risks:** The code only sets up paths and environment variable names; it does not handle sensitive data or perform risky operations.\n\n### Issues or Flaws:\n- The only anomaly is the future date (2025) in the copyright comment, which appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No actual reading or writing of environment variables occurs here, only defining variable names.\n- The code is purely configuration/setup, with no evident security flaws.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or very close to it, since the code is benign and only sets up configuration.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The malware score is zero because there's no malicious logic.\n- The obfuscation score is zero because the code is transparent.\n- The security risk score is zero because it does not perform any risky operations or handle sensitive data insecurely.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard configuration code with no security issues or malicious intent.** The reported scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports' scores are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, safe configuration setup. No issues or malicious activity detected. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
