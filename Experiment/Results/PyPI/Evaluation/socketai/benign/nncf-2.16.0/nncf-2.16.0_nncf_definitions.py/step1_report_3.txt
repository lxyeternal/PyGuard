  "purpose": "Define configuration paths and environment variable markers for the NNCF package.",
  "sources": "os and Path modules, environment variables NNCF_CI and NNCF_DEV",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; environment variables are only read for configuration flags",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code strictly handles paths and environment variable checks",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, sets up directory paths based on the current file location, and defines environment variable names for CI and development environments. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. The use of environment variables is typical for environment detection. The code appears to be legitimate setup code for a Python package without any indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads environment variables for environment detection and defines directory paths, which are standard practices.",
