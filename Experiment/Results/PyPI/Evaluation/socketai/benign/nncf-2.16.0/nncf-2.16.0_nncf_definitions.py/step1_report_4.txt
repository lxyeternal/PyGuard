{
  "purpose": "Define configuration paths and environment variables for the NNCF package, primarily for setting cache locations and environment indicators.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__), os.environ (indirectly via environment variables), Path.home()",
  "sinks": "None directly identified; no untrusted data usage or sensitive data handling evident.",
  "flows": "File path determination and environment variable checks do not process untrusted input; paths are constructed from trusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code sets environment variable names for CI and development environments, but does not directly manipulate environment variables; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and paths using standard library calls. It references environment variables but does not read or write them directly in this snippet. Paths are constructed from trusted sources such as __file__ and Path.home(). No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The presence of a copyright date in the future (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n\nOverall, the code is straightforward, standard configuration setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet that defines paths and environment variable names without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
