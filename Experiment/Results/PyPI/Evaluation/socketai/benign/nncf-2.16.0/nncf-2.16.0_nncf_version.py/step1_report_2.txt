  "purpose": "Define version specifications for dependencies and include license information",
  "sources": "Commented license and copyright headers, version variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspicious future copyright year (2025) and license headers, but no malicious code or anomalies in the actual code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, version variables, and constants defining dependency specifications. No input, output, or data processing occurs. The license headers are standard, but the future copyright year (2025) is unusual and potentially indicative of placeholder or outdated information. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscation or malicious code, no external data flow, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly metadata and version specification variables. No signs of malware or security risks. The only oddity is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, but does not impact security.",
