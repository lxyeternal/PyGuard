{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version specifications and licensing information for a Python package, likely related to machine learning frameworks.",
  "sources": "Reading license comments, version variables, and specification strings.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted input/output identified.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future; no actual malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, version variables, and specification strings. There are no functions, input handling, or external calls. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The license comments are standard, and the version specifications are typical for dependency management. The future copyright date is unusual but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for package versioning and licensing. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
