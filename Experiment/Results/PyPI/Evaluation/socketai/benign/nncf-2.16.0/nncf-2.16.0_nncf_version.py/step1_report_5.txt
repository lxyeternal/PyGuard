  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. License comments are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license comments and assigns version specifications to constants. There is no dynamic code execution, no data input, and no suspicious operations. The license comments do not introduce any security risk. The version variables are standard configuration parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, benign, and focused on defining package version constraints and license information. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
