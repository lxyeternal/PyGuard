  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely static metadata (license comments, version variables). No data flow, no input/output, no active code.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that there's no malicious intent or security risk is accurate.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns well with the evidence.\n- **Verdict:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with additional mention of the future copyright year (2025). The reviewer notes it may be a placeholder or typo.\n- **Assessment:** The code remains static metadata with no active behavior. The future year is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The slight concern about the future year does not translate into a security risk.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious or security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with emphasis on the future year (2025). No active code or data processing.\n- **Assessment:** The presence of a future year is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (possibly due to the unusual date, but minimal).\n- **Verdict:** The low security risk score seems appropriate; no malware detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; static license comments and version variables, with a future year (2025).\n- **Assessment:** No active or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, static configuration data, no dynamic code.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static metadata with no active or malicious behavior.\n- The only anomaly across reports is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the static nature of the code.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, with a slight increase (0.1) in one report due to the unusual date, which is acceptable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0 or very close to 0, given the static, benign nature.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The future year is not a security concern but should be corrected for accuracy.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments. No changes needed.**",
