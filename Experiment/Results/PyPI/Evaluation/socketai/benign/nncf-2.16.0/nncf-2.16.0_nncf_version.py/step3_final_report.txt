  "purpose": "Static metadata defining dependency versions and license information.",
  "sources": "License comments and version specification strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static constants only.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, consisting of license comments, version strings, and constants. No functions, data processing, or dynamic code are present. The only notable anomaly is the future year (2025), which does not pose a security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1). The minor anomaly does not impact security. The assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The only issue is the future copyright year, which should be updated but does not affect security. All reports are accurate, and scores are appropriate.",
