{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define license information, versioning, and dependency specifications for a Python package.",
  "sources": "License comments, version string assignment, and dependency specification variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points to untrusted data or external systems",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "License comments contain a future year (2025), which is inconsistent with the current date, possibly indicating outdated or placeholder text; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily static information including licensing, version, and dependency specifications. No user input, data reading, or external data interaction occurs. The dependency specifications are simple strings. There are no dynamic or obfuscated code segments, no external network connections, or other suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to serve configuration purposes without malicious intent. The only minor anomaly is the license comment with a future year, which is likely a typo or placeholder but does not pose security risks.",
