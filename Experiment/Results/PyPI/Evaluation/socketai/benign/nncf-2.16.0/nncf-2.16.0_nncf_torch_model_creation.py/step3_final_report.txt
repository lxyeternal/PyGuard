{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for creating, wrapping, loading, and managing compressed models using NNCF in PyTorch, including configuration handling, state restoration, and distributed synchronization.",
  "sources": "Functions that read model parameters, configuration dictionaries, and example inputs; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Model transformation functions, serialization, visualization, and logging; no data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model and config inputs into model wrapping, state loading, and transformation functions; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors identified. Use of deprecated functions is noted but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for model compression workflows, involving model wrapping, configuration extraction, state loading, and distributed process synchronization. It employs proper error handling, warnings, and telemetry for diagnostics. No signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, backdoors, or data leaks, are present. The use of barriers and logging is typical in distributed training environments. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for model management in PyTorch.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) due to standard system calls and deprecation warnings. Overall, it is safe for use in production environments.",
