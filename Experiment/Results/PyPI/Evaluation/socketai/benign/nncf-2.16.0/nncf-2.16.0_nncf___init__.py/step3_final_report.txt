{
  "purpose": "The code performs environment validation and framework detection for the NNCF library, importing necessary modules and logging errors if no supported frameworks are found.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, detection of framework specifications via importlib.util.find_spec, and path comparisons to determine framework presence.",
  "sinks": "Logging an error message when no frameworks are detected, which is benign and intended for user notification.",
  "flows": "Import statements and framework detection logic flow from module imports to environment validation and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; the code is straightforward and standard for environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment detection by checking for the presence of 'torch', 'tensorflow', 'onnx', and 'openvino' using importlib's find_spec. It compares the spec's origin path with the current file to determine if frameworks are installed externally. If none are found, it logs an error message. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The logic is clear, and the code uses common Python practices for environment validation. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment validation routine for the NNCF framework, performing no malicious actions or obfuscation. It correctly detects supported frameworks and logs an error if none are found. The code is safe, and the scores reflect its benign purpose.",
