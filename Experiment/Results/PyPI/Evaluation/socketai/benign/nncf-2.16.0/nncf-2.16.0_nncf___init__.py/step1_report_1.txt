{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures the Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) by importing modules, setting up supported frameworks, and logging errors if none are found.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially from external modules such as nncf and importlib, and the code that checks for framework presence via find_spec.",
  "sinks": "Logging error message using nncf_logger.error() if no supported frameworks are detected.",
  "flows": "The framework presence check uses find_spec to determine available frameworks, then logs an error message if none are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code performs standard module imports, configuration, and environment checks without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports, configuration setup, and environment validation. It uses standard Python features such as importlib for package detection and pathlib for path operations. The logic for checking framework presence appears normal. The error logging occurs only if no supported frameworks are detected, which is a typical environment validation step. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for the NNCF library, performing environment validation and configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a standard framework initialization script with no security risks identified.",
