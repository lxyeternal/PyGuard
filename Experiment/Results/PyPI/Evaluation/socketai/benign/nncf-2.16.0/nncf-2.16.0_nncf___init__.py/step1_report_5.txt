{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and configure the Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) for various supported machine learning frameworks, including logging, imports, framework detection, and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements, the list of supported frameworks, and the __file__ variable for path resolution.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; the code primarily performs setup and configuration without executing untrusted inputs or network communication.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, checking for framework presence via importlib, and logging an error if no supported frameworks are found. There is no user input or untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are observed. The code performs standard framework detection and logging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports numerous modules from the 'nncf' package, which are typical for a machine learning framework. It detects the presence of supported frameworks (torch, tensorflow, onnx, openvino) by checking the import specifications using 'importlib.util.find_spec' and verifying their origins. The logic ensures frameworks are not part of the same directory, indicating external installation. If none are found, an error is logged via 'nncf_logger'. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or credential management. The code is well-structured and appears to be standard setup code for a machine learning framework with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python machine learning framework, detecting installed dependencies and logging errors if none are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and intended for framework environment detection.",
