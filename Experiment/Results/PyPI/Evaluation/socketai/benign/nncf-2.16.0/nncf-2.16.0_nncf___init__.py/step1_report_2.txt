{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and imports various modules for the Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF), checks for available deep learning frameworks in the environment, and logs an error if none are found.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data to check for installed frameworks via 'importlib.util.find_spec' and the value of '__file__'.",
  "sinks": "The only output is a logged error message if no supported frameworks are found; no data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking for framework presence through 'find_spec' and updating the '_AVAILABLE_FRAMEWORKS' dictionary; then, based on the result, logging an error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard module imports, framework detection, and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules from the 'nncf' package, checks for the presence of supported deep learning frameworks by inspecting module specifications, and logs an error if none are installed. The framework detection uses 'importlib.util.find_spec' and compares the origin paths to the current file location, which is a standard approach. There is no evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The only output is a logging statement informing the user of missing dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup routine for detecting installed deep learning frameworks. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The only notable activity is environment inspection and logging a message if required dependencies are missing.",
