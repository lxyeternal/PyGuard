{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) for OpenVINO inference, importing various modules and checking the availability of supported frameworks in the environment.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from 'nncf' package, reads the '__file__' variable, and uses 'importlib.util.find_spec' to detect installed frameworks.",
  "sinks": "Logs an error message if no supported frameworks are found.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> Checks framework presence with 'find_spec' -> Logs error if none found.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; the logic for detecting frameworks is standard. The code checks for installed frameworks and logs an error if none are present, which is normal behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs module imports, defines constants, and detects the presence of frameworks via 'importlib.util.find_spec'. It then logs an error if none of the supported frameworks are found. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The purpose appears to be environment setup and validation. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate setup script for the NNCF framework, performing environment checks without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a normal part of a larger project and contains no malicious code or sabotage.",
