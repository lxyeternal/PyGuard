  "purpose": "Utility functions for tensor operations and custom autograd functions in PyTorch, including clamping, logistic transformation, rounding, and thresholding.",
  "sources": "Input tensors for functions such as 'clamp', 'logit', 'STRound', and 'STThreshold'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'logit' function could lead to invalid values if input contains 0 or 1, but no actual data flow to external systems or data leaks is present.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow through the functions; 'logit' computes log(x/(1-x)), 'clamp' restricts values, 'STRound' and 'STThreshold' perform in-place operations with gradient propagation.",
  "anomalies": "The 'logit' function may produce NaNs or infinities if inputs are exactly 0 or 1, but this is a known mathematical caveat, not malicious behavior. The license year '2025' is future-dated, possibly a placeholder, but not security relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard tensor operations with no external data, network activity, or obfuscation. The custom autograd functions are typical for quantization or thresholding in neural networks. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The 'symbolic' method supports ONNX export, a common practice. The only minor concern is the 'logit' function's potential for invalid inputs, but this is a mathematical issue, not a security vulnerability. The license date in the future is likely a placeholder and not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for neural network tensor processing with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though the risk could be conservatively lowered to 0. Overall, the code is safe and free of malicious behavior.",
