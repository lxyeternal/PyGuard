  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for neural network tensor processing with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though the risk could be conservatively lowered to 0. Overall, the code is safe and free of malicious behavior."
