{
  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, allowing multiple distributions to share the same namespace.",
  "sources": "The code imports pkg_resources and calls declare_namespace(__name__), which reads the current module's name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process any external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code only declares a namespace without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources library and declares the current package as a namespace, a common pattern for Python namespace packages. There are no data inputs, outputs, or flows. The code is simple, static, and standard in open-source namespace package implementations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation or complex logic is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely sets up a namespace for package distribution.",
