  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package to allow distribution of multiple packages under a common namespace.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and call to declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only declares a namespace",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace, which is common for namespace packages; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares the current module as a namespace package. This is a standard practice for packages split across multiple distributions under the same namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a structural purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
