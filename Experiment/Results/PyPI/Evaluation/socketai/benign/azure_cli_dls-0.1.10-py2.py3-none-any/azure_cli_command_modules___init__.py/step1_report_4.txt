  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling it to be split across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources and calling declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with standard namespace declaration; no suspicious or unusual behavior or code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' from setuptools and declares a namespace with __name__, which is a common pattern for namespace packages. No input reading, data handling, or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It is standard for setting up namespace packages in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign namespace declaration for Python packages and contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
