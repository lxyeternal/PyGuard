{
  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, likely as part of a larger modular package structure.",
  "sources": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and calls declare_namespace(__name__); these are the only source points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only declares a namespace without handling data or executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace for the current module. This pattern is typical in Python packages to support namespace packages. There are no inputs, no outputs, no data handling, and no execution beyond namespace declaration. No hardcoded credentials, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are evident. The code is straightforward and conforms to standard package practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs only a simple namespace setup typical in Python package distribution.",
