  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None; static namespace declaration without data flow or external input.",
  "flows": "Import of module -> call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, standard, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace with declare_namespace(__name__). It is a standard pattern for setting up namespace packages in Python. There are no untrusted data sources, no data sinks, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The code performs a simple, well-understood operation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
