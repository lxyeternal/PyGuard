  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static help text for CLI commands, with no executable logic, data handling, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The help strings are fixed and do not process user input or external data. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static help documentation with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The current scores are appropriate and justified, indicating no threat.",
