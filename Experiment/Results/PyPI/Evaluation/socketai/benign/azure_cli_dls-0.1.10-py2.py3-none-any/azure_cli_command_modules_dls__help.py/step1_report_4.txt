  "purpose": "Define help documentation and command structure for managing Data Lake Store accounts and filesystems via CLI.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; mainly static help strings and command parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no code execution or data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing; purely descriptive help definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious URL/network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string definitions for command help documentation related to Data Lake Store management. It includes parameter descriptions, examples, and help text for various commands. There are no executable functions, no input handling, no data processing, and no external network calls or system modifications. All help strings appear standard and relevant to the command-line interface. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely documentation and command structure definitions for CLI management of Data Lake Store resources. It poses no security threat or malware risk. The code appears safe, well-structured, and intended solely for user guidance.",
