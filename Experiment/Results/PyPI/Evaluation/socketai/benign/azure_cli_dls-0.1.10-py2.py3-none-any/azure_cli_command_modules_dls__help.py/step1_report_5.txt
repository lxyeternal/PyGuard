  "purpose": "Define CLI help documentation for managing Data Lake Store accounts, filesystems, and associated resources via Azure CLI.",
  "sources": "Help file definitions, command parameters, and example usage texts.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no code executes untrusted input or performs data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is only documentation and help definitions, not executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static help documentation strings defining command groups, commands, parameters, examples, and descriptions for Azure CLI. There is no actual executable logic, data handling, or external network interactions. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. All content appears to be standard documentation meant for user guidance. The only potential concern would be if these help files are manipulated to include malicious commands, but based on the provided static content, this is not the case.",
  "conclusion": "This is purely static CLI help documentation with no executable code or malicious intent. No security risks or malware are present. The code serves as user guidance for Azure Data Lake Store management commands.",
