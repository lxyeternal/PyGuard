  "purpose": "The code provides help documentation for managing Data Lake Store accounts, files, and related resources via CLI commands.",
  "sources": "The code sources are static string definitions for command help text, examples, and parameters, primarily stored in dictionary-like structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only contains static help strings and command specifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code is purely declarative help content with no runtime execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. The code is straightforward help documentation with no executable or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of static help text and command descriptions for Azure CLI Data Lake Store management commands. It does not include any code execution, user input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or data leaks. The help content appears autogenerated or manually crafted, serving solely as documentation.",
