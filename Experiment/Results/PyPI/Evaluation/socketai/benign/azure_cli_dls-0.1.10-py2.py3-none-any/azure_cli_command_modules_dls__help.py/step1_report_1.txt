  "purpose": "The code defines help documentation for Azure CLI commands related to managing Data Lake Store accounts and filesystems.",
  "sources": "The code reads static command parameters, command examples, and documentation strings. No user input or external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input from sources to sinks; the code only contains static help text and command metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code consists solely of structured help documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script provides structured help text for CLI commands, including parameters and examples. It does not include any executable logic, data processing, or code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The absence of runtime input handling or data transformation indicates low risk. The only potentially sensitive information could be in command parameters, but they are documented as inputs rather than processed or stored by this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation for CLI commands and does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It poses no security threat or malware risk. The overall security risk is negligible.",
