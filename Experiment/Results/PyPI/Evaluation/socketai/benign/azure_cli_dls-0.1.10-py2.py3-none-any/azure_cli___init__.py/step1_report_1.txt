  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, allowing it to be part of a namespace package",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own name (__name__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow pathways involving untrusted input or output",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace is common for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares the current package as a namespace package, which is a standard practice for modular packages. It does not contain any input handling, external data processing, or potential data leaks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal, straightforward, and aligns with common package management practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
