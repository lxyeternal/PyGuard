  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package in Python to facilitate namespace sharing across distributions.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; code performs a static namespace declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static declaration without external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward namespace declaration with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace using declare_namespace(__name__), a standard pattern in Python packaging. It contains no input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The purpose is solely to set up a namespace package, which is a common and benign practice. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence in these assessments is high (1). No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. Minor adjustment: the security risk score in Report 4 could be set to 0 for consistency, but the current low value is acceptable.",
