{
  "purpose": "Declare namespace for the package to allow multiple distribution packages to share the same namespace",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; uses package metadata functions",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leakage or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only declares namespace",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'declare_namespace' is common in namespace packages, but can sometimes be used to hide malicious modifications if unexpected; no such anomalies detected here",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the current package. This is a standard practice in Python namespace packages, especially in large projects like Microsoft's. There are no signs of data input, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a clear purpose related to package management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration and poses no malicious threat. It is unlikely to be involved in supply chain attacks or malicious activities.",
