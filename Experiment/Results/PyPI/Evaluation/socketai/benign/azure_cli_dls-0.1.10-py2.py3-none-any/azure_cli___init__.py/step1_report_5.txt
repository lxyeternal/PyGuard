  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling submodules to share a common namespace across distributions.",
  "sources": "Reads the current module's name (__name__) to declare the namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Uses __name__ to declare namespace; no data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__ to set up a namespace package. This is standard practice for namespace packages in Python and does not involve any malicious activity or security risk. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace declaration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe and serves a standard package structuring purpose.",
