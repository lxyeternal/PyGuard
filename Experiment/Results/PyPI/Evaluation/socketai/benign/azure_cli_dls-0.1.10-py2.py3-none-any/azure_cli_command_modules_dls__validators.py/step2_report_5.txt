  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the validity of their conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides validation functions for resource groups and subnets. It uses SDK calls, handles errors, and performs resource ID parsing and validation. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The functions are straightforward, performing resource enumeration, parsing, and validation. No signs of malicious code or dangerous behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (low, given the code's purpose)\n\n- **Justification:** The code is standard utility functions with no malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing resource validation, safe SDK usage, and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The functions perform resource list fetching, validation, and resource ID construction. No suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n- **Justification:** The code's operations are benign, and the low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, resource management and validation functions with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code is similar in nature—listing resources, parsing IDs, validation, and error handling.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. The low security risk score aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for resource validation, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** Same pattern—resource listing, validation, exception raising.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n- **Justification:** Completely benign resource validation code.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard validation functions, no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** Consistent with previous reports; safe SDK usage, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code performs resource validation and ID parsing without any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), justified because the code is utility functions with no security risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports. The code is safe.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** Should remain at 0.1-0.2, as the code is standard validation logic.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No further action or adjustment needed.",
