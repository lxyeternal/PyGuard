  "purpose": "Utility functions for resource validation and management within Azure CLI extensions, including resource listing, ID parsing, and validation of resource groups, accounts, and subnets.",
  "sources": "Resource list retrieval (client.list()), resource ID parsing (parse_resource_id), user input parameters (ns.name, ns.account_name, ns.resource_group_name, ns.subnet, ns.vnet_name).",
  "sinks": "Raising CLIError on invalid input, constructing resource IDs with resource_id(), setting namespace attributes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation functions -> resource listing/parsing -> error handling or attribute setting.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code performs standard validation and resource management tasks without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward resource validation and ID parsing using Azure SDKs and helper functions. No network calls, code injection, or malicious logic are present. Error handling is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are used. The functions are typical utility helpers for Azure CLI extensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard resource validation and management tasks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk scores (~0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the functions.",
