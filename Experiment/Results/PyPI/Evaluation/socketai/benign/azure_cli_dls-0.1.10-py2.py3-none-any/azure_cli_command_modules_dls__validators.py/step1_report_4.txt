  "purpose": "This code provides helper functions for managing Azure DataLake Store accounts and network configurations, specifically validating resource groups and subnets.",
  "sources": "client.list() (fetching account details), ns attributes (input parameters), import statements (module imports), and get_mgmt_service_client() function.",
  "sinks": "Parsing resource IDs, raising CLIError for invalid inputs, and setting namespace attributes.",
  "flows": "Fetching account list -> parsing resource IDs -> raising errors or setting attributes based on input validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code performs standard validation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard Azure SDK modules, defines helper functions for resource validation, and performs input validation and resource ID parsing. All functions appear to use safe, standard library functions for resource management. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present. No hardcoded credentials or data leakage points are detected. The functions raise exceptions only for invalid inputs, which is typical for CLI validation code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard validation tasks for Azure resource management, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses conventional SDK functions and proper input validation. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
