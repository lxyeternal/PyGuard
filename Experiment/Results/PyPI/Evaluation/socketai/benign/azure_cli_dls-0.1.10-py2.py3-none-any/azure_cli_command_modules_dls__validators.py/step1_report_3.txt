  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Azure resources, including resource group retrieval and validation of network parameters.",
  "sources": "client.list() for resource enumeration, get_mgmt_service_client() for service client creation, and input parameters such as account_name, subnet, vnet_name, resource_group_name.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not write or transmit data to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Client resource list retrieval and parsing resource IDs, with internal validation and resource identification; no external data flow or untrusted input flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The functions perform straightforward validation and resource management tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs resource management tasks within Azure, including listing resources, parsing resource IDs, and validating network parameters. All external interactions are via Azure SDK functions and internal validation. No data is transmitted to untrusted sources, no user credentials or secrets are embedded, and no suspicious behaviors like code injection or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard resource management utility functions for Azure. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It safely performs validation and resource identification with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
