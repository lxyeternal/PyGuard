  "purpose": "Defines a command loader class for Azure Data Lake Store CLI commands, initializing command types and loading command tables and arguments.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from azure.cli.core and azure.cli.command_modules.dls, loads command tables and arguments through imported functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports imported modules -> class initialization -> loading command table and arguments functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code strictly follows standard patterns for CLI command loader setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Azure CLI modules, defines a loader class with proper initialization, and loads command tables and arguments via imported functions. No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, and no suspicious code behaviors detected. The code appears to be a typical CLI extension loader, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard implementation for loading Azure CLI commands for Data Lake Store. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a normal part of Azure SDK extension code.",
