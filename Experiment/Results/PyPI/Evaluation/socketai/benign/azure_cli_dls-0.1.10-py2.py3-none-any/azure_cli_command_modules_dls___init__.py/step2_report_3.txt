  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code to determine the actual security posture.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a standard Azure CLI extension loader for Data Lake Store.\n- It imports core Azure CLI modules, defines a loader class inheriting from `AzCommandsLoader`, and loads command tables and arguments.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity are present.\n- The code follows typical patterns for Azure CLI extension development.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None.\n- **Data leaks or untrusted data flows:** Not detected.\n- **Obfuscation or dynamic code execution:** Absent.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials:** Not observed.\n- **Malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors:** No evidence.\n\n### Analysis of the Reports:\nAll five reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard, benign CLI extension loader with no malicious or security risk indicators. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, aligning with the actual code content.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, the code does not introduce any security risk.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured Azure CLI extension loader with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
