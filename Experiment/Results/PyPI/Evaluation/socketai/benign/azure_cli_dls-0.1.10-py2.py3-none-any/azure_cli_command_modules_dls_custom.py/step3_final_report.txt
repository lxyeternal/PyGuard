{
  "purpose": "Management and operational functions for Azure Data Lake Storage accounts, including creation, update, firewall rules, filesystem items, and permissions.",
  "sources": "SDK calls for resource management, filesystem access points, user input parameters for encryption keys, ACLs, IP addresses, and account configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input parameters (e.g., encryption keys, ACL specifications, IP addresses) that could lead to misconfiguration if misused, but no direct data leaks or malicious data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (encryption keys, ACLs, IP ranges) flow into SDK calls for resource configuration and filesystem operations; no untrusted data flows into code execution or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution detected. Validation is standard; no suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure resource management tasks with proper validation and error handling. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there are no signs of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering the handling of sensitive configurations but no active vulnerabilities. The overall structure and logic are consistent, and the code aligns with legitimate management functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure Data Lake Storage management library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
