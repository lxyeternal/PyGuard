{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for a Python distribution, likely part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "The call to pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; uses namespace declaration which is standard in namespace packages, no suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current module as a namespace package. This is a common pattern for modular Python packages, especially in large distributions or plugins. No user input, environment variables, or data flows are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior. The license and copyright comments are standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace package declaration with no signs of malicious activity. It appears benign and standard for Python packaging.",
