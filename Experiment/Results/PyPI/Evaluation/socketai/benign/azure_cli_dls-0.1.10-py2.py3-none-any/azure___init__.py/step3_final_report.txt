  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for Python package organization using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources module and calling declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → call to declare_namespace(__name__) (benign namespace setup).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace, a common pattern in Python packaging. It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
