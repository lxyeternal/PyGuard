  "purpose": "Declare namespace for the package using pkg_resources.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the pkg_resources module and declares the current package as a namespace. This is a standard practice in Python package development for namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The minimal structure and licensing comments do not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a standard purpose in Python package namespace declaration. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
