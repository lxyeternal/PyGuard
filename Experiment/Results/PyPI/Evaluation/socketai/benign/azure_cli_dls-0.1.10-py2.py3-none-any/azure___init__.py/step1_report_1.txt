{
  "purpose": "Declare namespace for the package to allow for namespace package distribution",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's name (__name__) to declare a namespace",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow beyond namespace declaration",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' on __name__, which is typical for namespace package setup. There are no other operations, no data input, or untrusted data handling. The purpose appears to be setting up a namespace for a larger package, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
