  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, allowing for namespace sharing across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow, no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace is a standard pattern for namespace packages, no anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing 'pkg_resources' and declaring a namespace using 'declare_namespace'. This is a typical pattern in Python namespace packages, especially in packaging systems like setuptools. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated code, are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for namespace declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard namespace declaration for a Python package. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and benign.",
