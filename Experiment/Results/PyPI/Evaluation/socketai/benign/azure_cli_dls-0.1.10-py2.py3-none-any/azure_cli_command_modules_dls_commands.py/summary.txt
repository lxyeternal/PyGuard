  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, boilerplate CLI extension code for Azure Data Lake Storage, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects the resource management nature of the commands but does not indicate any threat."
