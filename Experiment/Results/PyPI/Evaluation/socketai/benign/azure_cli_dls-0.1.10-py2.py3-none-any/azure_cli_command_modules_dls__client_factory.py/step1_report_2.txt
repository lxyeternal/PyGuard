  "purpose": "Provide factory functions for Azure Data Lake Storage account management and filesystem access within Azure CLI context.",
  "sources": "Read login credentials via Profile.get_login_credentials and access to cli_ctx and resource endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Return of service client objects and AzureDLFileSystem instances that utilize credentials.",
  "flows": "Credentials retrieved from Profile and passed to AzureDLFileSystem; service clients instantiated with credentials and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Usage of credentials appears standard for Azure SDK. No obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions to retrieve management clients and filesystem objects for Azure Data Lake Storage, leveraging standard Azure SDK patterns. Credentials are obtained via the Profile class, which is part of the Azure CLI login process. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The functions serve as wrappers around SDK calls, with no network activity or data exfiltration evident. The code follows typical Azure SDK usage patterns and does not perform any actions outside the expected behavior for managing Azure Data Lake resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Azure CLI extension code for managing Data Lake Storage resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is likely safe for use as part of Azure management tooling.",
