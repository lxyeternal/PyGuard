  "purpose": "A simple 'Hello World!' print statement with no external input or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no external dependencies, input, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely harmless, with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
