{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure the packaging for the dicomweb-client Python project, including reading version info and defining dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from src/dicomweb_client/__init__.py, reads README.md for long description, and package metadata from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data leaks. No data is sent over networks or written insecurely within this code.",
  "flows": "The only flow is reading the version string from a local file to assign to package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No user input handling or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the version from a file, loads the README, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All operations involve local file reads or static configuration data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data injection, or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply configures the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
