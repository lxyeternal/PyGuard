  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'dicomweb-client' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable from 'src/dicomweb_client/__init__.py'; reads README.md for long description; static configuration data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data used for setup configuration is hardcoded or read from controlled files.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from a file, then uses static data to configure package setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading version info and description files, then invoking setuptools.setup with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No malicious code, external data processing, or suspicious activities detected. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. The code appears to follow common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and standard for package distribution.",
