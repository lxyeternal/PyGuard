  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code quality, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code reads version info from a source file and uses static metadata, which is typical.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The only regex used is to extract the version string, which is a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, aligns with the code.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, correctly notes the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Same observations as above, consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Same as previous, no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to others, with an explicit note that the version extraction uses regex but appears standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n  - The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but given the code's simplicity and lack of actual security issues, this seems overestimated.\n- **Conclusion:** The minor securityRisk score (0.1) is not justified by any real vulnerability or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** All are 0, except report 5, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, this should also be 0.\n- **Any anomalies or errors?**  \n  - The regex for version extraction is standard; no issues there.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.\n  - No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  - All reports should have malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n  - The slight increase in report 5's securityRisk to 0.1 is unjustified; it should be 0.\n\n- **Risk justification:**  \n  - The code does not perform any risky operations, network calls, or handle untrusted input.\n  - The process of reading version info is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are generally accurate, except for report 5's slight security risk elevation, which should be reset to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0** |\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
