  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'dicomweb-client' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; reads '__version__' from src/dicomweb_client/__init__.py.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks for untrusted input, no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from package source to embed in setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No malicious code or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools. It reads the long description from README.md and extracts the version number from a source file. Dependencies are clearly specified with version constraints. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code does not contain any network activity, file modifications, or suspicious operations. The code structure follows typical setup script conventions without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
