  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The filtering of urllib3 warnings is a common practice. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern. The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature."
