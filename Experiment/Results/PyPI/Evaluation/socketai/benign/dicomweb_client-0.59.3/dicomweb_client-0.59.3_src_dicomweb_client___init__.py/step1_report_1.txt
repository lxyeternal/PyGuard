  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and constants from the 'dicomweb_client' library for use in handling DICOM web data.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dicomweb_client.api', 'dicomweb_client.protocol', and 'dicomweb_client.uri' modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in this code snippet; no untrusted data processing or external output occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this code fragment, as it only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation are present. The version string appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a version declaration and import statements from a third-party library, 'dicomweb_client'. It defines an __all__ list for exports, which is common in Python modules. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or suspicious constructs. Since it only imports and re-exports classes and constants, it does not perform any actions that could be malicious. No sensitive data or external communication is initiated here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import module that re-exports selected classes and constants from a DICOM web client library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risk.",
