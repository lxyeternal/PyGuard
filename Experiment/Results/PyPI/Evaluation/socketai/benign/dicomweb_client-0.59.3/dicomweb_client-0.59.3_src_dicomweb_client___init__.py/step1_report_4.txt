{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and functions related to DICOM web clients and URI handling for medical imaging data management.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'dicomweb_client' package, which are internal library modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or data leaks; no data is read from external sources or written to outside systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs import statements and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The version string appears to be a standard package version.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of version declaration, import statements from a third-party library, and defining __all__ for module exports. No input reading, data processing, or dynamic execution is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The imported modules are standard for handling DICOM web services and URIs, indicating a healthcare imaging application setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign module that re-exports classes from the 'dicomweb_client' library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. The overall security risk is negligible.",
