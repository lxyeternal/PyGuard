  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports specific classes and constants from the 'dicomweb_client' library and re-exports them.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, network communication, or data processing is reported.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The version string appears standard.\n- The code's purpose is to serve as an API or interface layer, exposing selected components for use elsewhere.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The code matches the description: it declares a version string, imports classes and constants from the 'dicomweb_client' library, and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n- No issues or malicious behaviors are evident in the code itself.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- None are apparent. The code appears syntactically correct and logically sound for its purpose.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 1, with confidence 1.\n- Given the analysis, these scores seem appropriate:\n  - Malware: 0, since there's no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n  - Security risk: 0, because the code is a benign import/export module.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports justify high scores; all indicate no malicious or risky behavior.\n- Therefore, risk scores should remain low (close to 0).\n\n**Malware considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The 'malware' score should be 0.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is static and does not process untrusted input.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign module for re-exporting classes and constants from a third-party library, with no security concerns.",
