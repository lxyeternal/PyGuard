{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an API module for a DICOM web client, exporting specific classes and constants for use in other parts of an application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dicomweb_client' package modules: api, protocol, and uri.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and constants from the 'dicomweb_client' package and re-exports them. There are no runtime data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code serves as a simple interface or API layer for DICOM web client functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that imports and re-exports classes and constants from an external library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this snippet.",
