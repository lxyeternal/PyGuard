  "purpose": "Import and expose classes and constants related to DICOM web client functionality for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the dicomweb_client library, specifically api, protocol, and uri modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily imports and exports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The version string is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from the dicomweb_client library and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets. The code functions as a simple re-export module, which is common in package design. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that re-exports components from the dicomweb_client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
