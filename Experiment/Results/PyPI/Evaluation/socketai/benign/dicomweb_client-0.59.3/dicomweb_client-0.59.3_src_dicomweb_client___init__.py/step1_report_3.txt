{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and objects from the 'dicomweb_client' library for use in a larger application, likely related to handling DICOM web services.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes from the 'dicomweb_client' package, which may internally read configuration or data, but the import statements themselves do not read untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code only defines imports and an export list. No data processing, network, or file I/O occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input, as this code only performs static import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for module import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, imports classes and functions from a known library ('dicomweb_client'), and defines an export list. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code appears to be a standard module initialization with no dynamic or unsafe behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import and export module setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes selected classes and objects from a third-party library for use elsewhere.",
