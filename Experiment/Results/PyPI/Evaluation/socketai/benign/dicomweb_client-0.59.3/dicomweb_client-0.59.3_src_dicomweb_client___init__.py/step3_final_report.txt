{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that re-exports specific classes and constants from the 'dicomweb_client' library for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string and imports classes and constants from the 'dicomweb_client' library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing classes/constants to defining an __all__ list for export; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string, imports specific classes and constants from a third-party library, and defines an export list. It contains no dynamic execution, input handling, network activity, or other suspicious behavior. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the environment appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module that re-exports components from 'dicomweb_client'. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
