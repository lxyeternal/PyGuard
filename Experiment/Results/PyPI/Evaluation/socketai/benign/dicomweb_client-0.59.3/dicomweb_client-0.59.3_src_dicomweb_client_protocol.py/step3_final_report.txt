{
  "purpose": "Defines a Protocol interface for a DICOM web client, outlining method signatures and expected behaviors without implementation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as URLs, UIDs, search filters, and configuration attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data handling in implementations; no data processing occurs in this interface definition.",
  "flows": "Implied data flows in actual implementations; none in the interface itself.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code is a pure interface (Protocol) with detailed docstrings, no executable logic, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscation. It serves as a contract for implementing classes, with no data processing or network activity. The high scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriate given its role as an interface. The risk score is low (~0.0-0.1), reflecting minimal inherent security risk in a non-implemented protocol.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface definition for a DICOM web client, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are consistent with its nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
