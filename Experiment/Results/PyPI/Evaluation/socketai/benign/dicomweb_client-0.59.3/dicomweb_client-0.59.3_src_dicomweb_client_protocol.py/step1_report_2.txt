{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Protocol interface for a DICOM web client, outlining methods for searching, retrieving, storing, and deleting DICOM data from a server.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input directly; it only defines an interface with method parameters that may accept data such as URLs, UIDs, filters, and other parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in the code, as it lacks implementation. Potential data flows could occur via method parameters such as URLs, filters, or data to be retrieved or stored, but no actual data processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "No actual data flows are present; the interface specifies method signatures without implementation. In a real implementation, flows would involve network requests and data processing based on method inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is purely interface definition with detailed docstrings, no executable logic or embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of interface definitions (method signatures) for a DICOM web client. It specifies various methods for searching, retrieving, storing, and deleting medical imaging data, along with detailed parameter descriptions. There is no executable code, no embedded credentials, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The detailed docstrings indicate intended functionality but do not perform any operations themselves. The structure is standard for an interface or protocol in Python, with conditional imports for compatibility, and no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a purely declarative interface with no implementation, no embedded secrets, and no signs of malicious activity. It serves as a standard contract for a DICOM web client, with thorough documentation. There is no indication of malware or security risks within this interface definition.",
