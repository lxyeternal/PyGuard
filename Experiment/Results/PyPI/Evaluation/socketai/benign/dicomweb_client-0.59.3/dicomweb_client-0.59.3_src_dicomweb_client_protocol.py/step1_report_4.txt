{
  "purpose": "Define a Protocol interface for a DICOM web client with methods for retrieving, searching, storing, and deleting DICOM data.",
  "sources": "No active data sources; only method signatures and class attributes are defined, no data input or external data reads present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling evident; no code that processes external input or writes data.",
  "flows": "No executable flow; interface declarations without implementation prevent data flow analysis.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard interface definition with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns are present. The use of 'pass' indicates placeholders, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a Protocol for a DICOM web client, outlining method signatures, parameters, and documentation. There are no implementation details, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is structurally straightforward, serving as an interface specification. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign interface definition for a DICOM web client with no malicious behavior, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscated or suspicious code. It serves as a blueprint for implementation without executing any logic. Overall, it poses no security risks.",
