  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's nature, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely an interface (Protocol) with method signatures and detailed docstrings.\n- No implementation, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code does not perform any operations; it only defines expected behaviors for a DICOM web client.\n- The imports and class attributes are standard, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- The absence of actual request handling or data flow makes the code inherently safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-Report Analysis**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines a Protocol interface for a DICOM web client.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Only method signatures; no data flow or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None; clean interface.\n- **Analysis:** No executable logic, no embedded secrets, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, matching the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining a DICOM web client interface.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning applies; no implementation, no data handling, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to the interface's potential to handle untrusted data, but since no data is processed here, this is acceptable).\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable given the interface nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines an interface with methods that could, in implementation, send or receive data.\n- **Analysis:** No actual data flow or code execution; only method signatures.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1. Slightly elevated but acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores align with the benign, interface-only code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar interface definition.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code, no embedded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0. The very low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Again, an interface with no implementation.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- All reports describe interface definitions with no executable logic.\n- No embedded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: mostly 0 or very close) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, interface definitions.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it — no security risks in the interface code.\n\n**Note:** If these reports are based solely on the interface definitions, the scores are correct. If implementation code were present, a different risk assessment might be necessary, but given the current code, the assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports' scoring and reasoning are accurate. The code is a benign, standard interface definition with no security concerns.",
