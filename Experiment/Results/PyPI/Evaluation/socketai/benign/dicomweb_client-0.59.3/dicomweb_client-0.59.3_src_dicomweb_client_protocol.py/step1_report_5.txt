{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Protocol interface for a DICOM web client, specifying methods for querying, retrieving, storing, and deleting DICOM data via a web service.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from method parameters such as URLs, UIDs, search filters, and optional media types. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include method implementations where data might be sent over network requests or retrieved from external servers. However, actual implementations are missing (pass statements), so no data leakage or network activity is directly visible.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow occurs in the provided code since methods are only declared with pass statements. If implementations were present, flows would involve data from parameters (like URLs, UIDs, filters) to network requests and responses.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual code structures. The code is purely interface declarations with docstrings, no executable or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of interface definitions (protocols) with method signatures and comprehensive docstrings explaining their intended functionality. No actual logic, data processing, or external calls are implemented. The absence of executable code means there are no malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden code. The presence of detailed comments and use of standard typing practices indicate a standard interface setup without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable interface definition for a DICOM web client. It contains no logic or data handling that could be malicious. It is likely part of a larger package where actual implementations may exist. Based solely on this code, there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
