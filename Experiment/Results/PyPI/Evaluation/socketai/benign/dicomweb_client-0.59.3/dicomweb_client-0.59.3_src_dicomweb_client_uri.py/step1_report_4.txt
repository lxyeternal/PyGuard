  "purpose": "Utilities for DICOMweb URI manipulation, including building, parsing, and validating DICOMweb resource URIs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'build_query_string', 'parse_query_parameters', and 'URI.from_string'. URI object properties and methods read data for URI construction and validation.",
  "sinks": "String outputs from '__str__' and 'update' methods; URL parsing in '_validate_base_url'; exceptions raised during validation. These could potentially leak internal data if misused, but are standard for URL handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to validation functions, then through URI construction methods, with data parsed from or output to strings or URL components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden data. The code adheres to standard URL validation and UID validation per DICOM standards.",
  "analysis": "The code provides robust URI handling for DICOMweb resources, including validation of URLs, UIDs, frames, and suffixes. Validation functions check for common security issues such as URL scheme correctness and UID format conformity. The 'from_string' method carefully parses and validates input URIs, raising exceptions on anomalies. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or network-based malicious actions, is present. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and safe for intended use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured utility for managing DICOMweb URIs, with thorough validation to prevent malformed URL construction. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It is safe for use, assuming proper input data.",
