  "purpose": "Provide utilities for constructing, parsing, and validating DICOMweb URIs and related query parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data from URI strings, function parameters for UID, frame sequences, and query parameters.",
  "sinks": "URI string construction, UID validation, query string formation, URI parsing and validation.",
  "flows": "Input data (URIs, UIDs, parameters) → validation functions → URI class methods and properties → URI string output or parsed object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of permissive mode to bypass standard UID validation; no hardcoded credentials or secret data; no network or file I/O in code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured, standards-compliant way to build and parse DICOMweb URIs with validation routines for UIDs and other components. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The permissive mode is a potential risk if misused, but it is an explicit feature for handling non-conformant UIDs, not malicious activity. All validation is performed locally, and no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are present. Usage of standard libraries and clear structure further reduce suspicion. Overall, the code appears to be a well-implemented utility module for URI handling with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standards-compliant utility for DICOMweb URI manipulation. It includes validation and parsing functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The permissive mode allows flexibility but should be used cautiously. There are no hidden backdoors, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code patterns. Overall, low security risk and malware likelihood.",
