  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility module for DICOMweb URI handling with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The permissive mode introduces a minor potential security concern if misused but is an explicit, controlled feature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the explicit documentation of permissive validation. No action is necessary; the supply chain risk is minimal."
