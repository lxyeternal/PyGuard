  "purpose": "Utilities for DICOMweb URI manipulation, including URI construction, parsing, and validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in functions such as build_query_string, parse_query_parameters, and the URI class constructor; data parsing in from_string method.",
  "sinks": "URL parsing in _validate_base_url, UID validation in _validate_uid, _validate_frames, and URI methods; string formatting and URI string assembly in __str__ and related methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into validation functions and URI constructor; validated data is used to build or parse URI strings; string outputs are generated via __str__ or from_string methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code present. UID validation with permissive mode might relax standard constraints but is explicitly documented. No unusual dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive utility for managing DICOMweb URIs, with careful validation of UIDs, URL schemes, and URI structure. Functions such as build_query_string and parse_query_parameters build and parse query strings securely. The URI class encapsulates URI components and enforces standards through validation functions. No embedded malicious logic, external data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The permissive mode allows relaxed UID validation, which could potentially be exploited if misused, but this is explicitly documented and intended for non-standard data. Overall, the code is well-structured, adheres to standard validation practices, and contains no malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs standard URI construction, parsing, and validation for DICOMweb resources. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe, with thorough validation routines. The permissive mode could theoretically introduce risks if misused, but this is explicitly noted. Overall, the code is secure and does not exhibit signs of malware or sabotage.",
