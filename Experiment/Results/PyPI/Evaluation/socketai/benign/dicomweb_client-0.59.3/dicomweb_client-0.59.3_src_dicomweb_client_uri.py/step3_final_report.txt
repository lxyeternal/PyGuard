  "purpose": "Utilities for DICOMweb URI manipulation, including building, parsing, and validating URIs according to the DICOM standard.",
  "sources": "URI components such as base URL, study UID, series UID, SOP UID, frames, suffix, and input strings for parsing.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input in URI strings during parsing; validation routines to prevent malformed UIDs and frames; no network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into URI components; validation functions check UID formats and frames; constructed URIs are assembled from validated components; permissive mode relaxes validation rules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected; no obfuscation patterns; validation routines are standard and explicit; permissive mode is a documented feature, not hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides comprehensive URI management for DICOMweb resources, including strict validation of UIDs and frames, and flexible parsing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The permissive mode, while relaxing validation, is explicitly documented and intended for handling non-conformant data, not malicious intent. The validation functions are standard, using regex and length checks, and the URI construction and parsing follow established patterns. The overall structure is clear, well-documented, and adheres to standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility module for DICOMweb URI handling with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The permissive mode introduces a minor potential security concern if misused but is an explicit, controlled feature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the explicit documentation of permissive validation. No action is necessary; the supply chain risk is minimal.",
