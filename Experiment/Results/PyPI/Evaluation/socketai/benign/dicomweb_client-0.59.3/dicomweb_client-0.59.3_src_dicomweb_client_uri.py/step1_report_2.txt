  "purpose": "Utilities for DICOMweb URI manipulation, including building, parsing, and validating DICOMweb resource URIs.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, including 'params' dictionary, URI string parsing, and UID validation.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations for URI construction, URL parsing for validation, and UID validation functions that could potentially raise exceptions or process input data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through validation functions and used to construct URI strings, with parsing functions extracting UID components from URL strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The UID validation uses permissive mode, but this is explicitly documented and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for constructing, parsing, and validating DICOMweb URIs, adhering to standard practices and DICOM specifications. Validation functions check URL schemes, UID formats, and sequence orderings. The URI class manages resource components and provides methods for URI manipulation and derivation of parent/child URIs. No malicious code patterns or obfuscated code structures are present. All operations are safe string manipulations, URL parsing, and validation routines. The use of regular expressions for UID validation is standard. No external network operations or data exfiltration methods are implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-documented utility module for handling DICOMweb URIs, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. Its purpose is aligned with legitimate URI handling and validation, with clear boundaries and no suspicious code paths.",
