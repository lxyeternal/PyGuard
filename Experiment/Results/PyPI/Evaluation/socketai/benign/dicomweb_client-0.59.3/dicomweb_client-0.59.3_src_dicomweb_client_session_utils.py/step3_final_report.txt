  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating and configuring requests.Session objects with various authentication methods and SSL options, including support for GCP credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for file paths, user-supplied CA bundle and certificate files, external GCP credentials module.",
  "sinks": "File existence checks, environment variable expansion, external module import, setting session.verify and session.cert.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (file paths, auth objects, credentials) are expanded and validated, then assigned to session properties.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable expansion without strict validation; deprecation warning for external GCP module, but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard session creation and configuration routines with proper validation and logging. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The handling of external dependencies and environment variables is typical, with no evident security flaws. File existence checks mitigate path injection risks, and the deprecation warning is normal maintenance practice. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware scores are zero, consistent with benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for HTTP session management, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
