  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for creating and configuring HTTP requests sessions, including handling authentication and SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as auth objects, username/password, file paths, and optional Google credentials.",
  "sinks": "Uses session objects to perform HTTP requests, potentially including authenticated or SSL-configured requests.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to configure requests.Session objects, with optional file path expansion and verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code performs standard session setup and configuration. Usage of warnings for deprecated features is noted but not malicious. No obfuscated or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for creating and configuring requests.Session objects, with options for authentication, SSL certificate setup, and Google Cloud credentials. It employs standard practices such as environment variable expansion for file paths and existence checks for security files. The deprecated warning indicates maintenance but not malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or suspicious network behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, legitimate utility functions for HTTP session management with no malicious intent. It handles configuration securely and transparently, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
