{
  "purpose": "Expose specific classes from the 'dicomweb_client' package as part of an API interface module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dicomweb_client' modules ('web', 'file', 'protocol').",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports and exports classes without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from a third-party package and defines '__all__' for exports. It contains no data processing, user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API interface module with no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
