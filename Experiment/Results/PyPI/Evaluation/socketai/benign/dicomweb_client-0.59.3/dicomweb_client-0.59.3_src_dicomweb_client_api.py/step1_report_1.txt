  "purpose": "To import and expose classes for DICOM web client operations, likely for handling medical imaging data.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from the 'dicomweb_client' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code only imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward imports with no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports three classes from a third-party package and defines the module exports. There are no data inputs, external connections, or code execution paths that could be malicious. The package appears to be related to DICOM web services, likely used for medical imaging data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident based on this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as an interface for importing classes from a known package. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
