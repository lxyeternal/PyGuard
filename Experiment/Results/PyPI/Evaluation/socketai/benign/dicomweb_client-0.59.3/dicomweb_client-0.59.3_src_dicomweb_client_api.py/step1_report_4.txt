{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an API module that imports classes related to DICOM web client functionality, likely for handling medical imaging data over a web interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'dicomweb_client' package: 'web', 'file', and 'protocol' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only performs import statements and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward and typical for an API interface.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from an external package and defines an __all__ list for exports. It does not contain any code execution, data handling, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The simplicity suggests standard library use for medical imaging communication, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API module for exposing certain classes from a third-party DICOM web client library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
