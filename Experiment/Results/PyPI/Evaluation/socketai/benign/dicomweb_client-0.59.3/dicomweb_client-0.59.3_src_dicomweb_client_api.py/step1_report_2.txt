{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports specific classes from the dicomweb_client library for API interactions with DICOMweb servers.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dicomweb_client modules: web, file, protocol.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Import sources are not flow sources for data manipulation; they are module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; code is straightforward and uses standard import/export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes related to DICOMweb communication and explicitly exports them via __all__. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs here. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a simple module export setup. Since it involves only imports and export declarations, there is no suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module interface for DICOMweb client classes. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and is standard in structure. No anomalies or malware are present.",
