  "purpose": "To provide an API interface for DICOM web client functionality by importing relevant classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from dicomweb_client.web, dicomweb_client.file, and dicomweb_client.protocol modules",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak",
  "flows": "Imports data from external modules, but no data flows are present within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only straightforward imports and exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes related to DICOM web client functionality and exposes them via __all__ for external use. No data processing, user input, or network communication occurs here. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present. The code appears to be a simple module export setup without any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module that re-exports classes for API use without any malicious intent or security issues.",
