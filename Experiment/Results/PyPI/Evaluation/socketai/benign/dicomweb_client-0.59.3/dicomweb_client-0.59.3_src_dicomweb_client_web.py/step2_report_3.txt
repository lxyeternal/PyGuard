  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive, well-structured DICOMweb client with URL parsing, request retries, multipart handling, and standard data processing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The confidence is high (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Use of retries, logging, and validation are standard. The conclusion that the code is legitimate and low risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard network requests, data encoding/decoding, and response handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. Confidence is high (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code's functions for network I/O, data parsing, and retries are standard. No malicious signals are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data flow, response parsing, and handling server responses. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries and practices. Confident (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code's response handling and URL construction follow standard practices. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights URL parsing, request methods, and data handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. Uses retries and standard libraries. Confidence is high (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's structure and logic are typical for an SDK of this kind. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes URL parsing, response headers, and data flow. No secrets or obfuscation. Uses standard patterns. Confidence: 0.95. Malware: 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior—no hidden code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, and the code is readable and standard.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Given the thorough validation, standard use of libraries, and no evidence of malicious intent, a low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate.\n\n- **Overall:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented open-source DICOMweb client. No supply chain or malware concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust Malware Score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher than 0, but still low, around **0.1-0.2**.\n- **Confidence in assessment:** High, around 0.95.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1-0.2\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured DICOMweb client with no malicious or obfuscated patterns detected.",
