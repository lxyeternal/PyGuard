  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive, standard DICOMweb client with URL handling, request retries, multipart processing, and data parsing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low risk, mainly due to standard network operations and handling of potentially sensitive medical data).\n- **Justification:** The detailed analysis aligns with the code's purpose. No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The low security risk is appropriate given the context.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard network requests, data encoding/decoding, and no malicious behavior. Uses 'retrying' for robustness, no signs of obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the detailed reasoning. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on response parsing, multipart handling, and standard data flow. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning matches the code's behavior. The low security risk reflects standard network and data handling.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes URL parsing, request handling, and data processing. No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code's purpose and implementation. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—standard network request wrappers, multipart handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** The low scores align with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, which is consistent with the code's structure and purpose.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation patterns are present; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher than zero but low, reflecting typical concerns about networked data handling and potential data sensitivity, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)  \n**Risk Score:** ~0.1–0.2 (standard low risk for a network client handling sensitive data, no malicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured DICOMweb client. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the detailed analysis. No evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation is detected.",
