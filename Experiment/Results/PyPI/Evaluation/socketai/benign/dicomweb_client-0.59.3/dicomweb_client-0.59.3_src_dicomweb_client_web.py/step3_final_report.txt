  "purpose": "A comprehensive Python client for interacting with a DICOMweb service over HTTP, facilitating data retrieval, storage, and deletion with robust URL handling, request retries, and multipart processing.",
  "sources": "URL parsing, request parameters, response headers, data encoding/decoding functions",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods, response handling, data parsing functions",
  "flows": "Input data (URLs, parameters) → HTTP requests → server responses → data decoding/parsing",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code follows standard patterns without suspicious or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of a DICOMweb client, utilizing common libraries such as requests and pydicom. It performs URL validation, request retries, multipart message handling, and data parsing in a transparent manner. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation patterns are present. The request retry logic and response handling are implemented with standard best practices. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration patterns are evident. The security considerations are typical for such networked data clients, with input validation and error handling properly addressed.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, secure, and transparent DICOMweb client with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, consistent with standard network data clients handling sensitive medical data.",
