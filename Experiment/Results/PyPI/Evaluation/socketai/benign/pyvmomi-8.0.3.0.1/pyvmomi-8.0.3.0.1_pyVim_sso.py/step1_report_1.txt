  "purpose": "Helper module for performing SSO operations, including certificate handling, security token requests, and SOAP message construction for authentication and authorization.",
  "sources": "Reads from certificate files (_extract_certificate), private and public key files (in SecurityTokenRequest), environment variables, and data from SSL connections.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP/HTTPS requests with SOAP messages, signs XML requests with private keys, embeds signatures into XML, and performs cryptographic hashing and signing operations.",
  "flows": "Reads certificates and keys -> constructs SOAP requests -> signs requests -> sends requests via HTTP/HTTPS connections -> receives responses -> extracts assertions or handles faults.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of cryptographic operations appears standard. The code performs signature creation and certificate verification as expected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "Reviewed code for malicious activity: It handles SSL certificates, signs SOAP messages, constructs SAML requests, and performs cryptographic hashing and signing. No evidence of data exfiltration, network suspicious domains, or malicious backdoors. Certificate validation and signature processes seem proper. The code includes standard cryptographic practices and error handling. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs. All functions appear to serve legitimate security purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate helper module for SSO and security token operations. It implements cryptographic signing, certificate extraction, and secure communication with an STS. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
