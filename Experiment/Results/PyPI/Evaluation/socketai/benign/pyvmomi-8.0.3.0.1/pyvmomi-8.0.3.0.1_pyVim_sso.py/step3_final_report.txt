{
  "purpose": "The code provides cryptographic signing, certificate extraction, and SOAP message handling for SSO token requests, including SAML assertions and certificate validation.",
  "sources": "Reads certificate files, private/public keys, and input data for cryptographic operations; constructs SOAP requests; reads network responses.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission of SOAP messages; cryptographic signing outputs; certificate validation checks.",
  "flows": "Certificate files → cryptographic functions → SOAP message construction → network transmission → response processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard cryptographic libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard certificate parsing, cryptographic signing, SOAP message creation, and network communication for SSO token exchange. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Cryptographic operations follow best practices, and certificate validation is properly handled when certificates are provided. No suspicious network domains or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. External risks could arise from misconfigured certificates or keys, but these are inherent to cryptographic implementations, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SSO token handling, cryptographic signing, and secure communication. It shows no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are accurate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
