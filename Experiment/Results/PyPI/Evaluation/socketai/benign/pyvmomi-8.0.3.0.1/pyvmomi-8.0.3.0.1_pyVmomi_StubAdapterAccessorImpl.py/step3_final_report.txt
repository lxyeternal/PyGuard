{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a VMware SDK module that manages property access and emulates legacy type behaviors for managed objects, facilitating backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'info' object properties and 'mo' managed object; accesses type information and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Invokes 'InvokeMethod' with constructed 'info' and 'mo' objects, passing property names and types as parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'info' and 'mo' into 'InvokeMethod' via the constructed method call, with type adjustments and legacy handling in between.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs standard SDK operations.",
  "analysis": "The code handles property access, type mapping, and legacy behavior emulation within a VMware SDK context. It dynamically adjusts types, especially for list types of managed objects, and invokes methods accordingly. No external untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to code injection or data leaks. The use of dynamic method invocation is typical for SDKs and appears controlled. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure and purpose align with legitimate SDK support functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility within a VMware SDK for property management and legacy support. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores reflect its safe, standard nature: malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, low security risk (~0.1-0.2).",
