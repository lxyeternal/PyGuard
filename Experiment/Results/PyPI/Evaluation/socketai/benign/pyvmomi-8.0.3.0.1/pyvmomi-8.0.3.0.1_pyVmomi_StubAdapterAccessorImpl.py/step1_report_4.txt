{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a vSphere/VMware SDK wrapper for managing VM objects, properties, and types.",
  "sources": "Imports from .VmomiSupport module, and internal variables such as _legacyTypes",
  "sinks": "Method InvokeMethod (called within InvokeAccessor), object property accesses, type manipulations",
  "flows": "InvokeAccessor reads property info, possibly modifies info.type, then calls InvokeMethod with parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities. Use of legacy type mappings and dynamic type adjustments are typical for SDK compatibility but could obscure behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages VMware object types and properties, emulating legacy behavior for compatibility. It uses internal mappings to modify type information, especially for list types of ManagedObjects. The main function InvokeAccessor prepares property info and invokes a method on the managed object. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. It relies on external modules for core functionality. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows were observed. Its structure appears consistent with SDK compatibility layers rather than malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK support module designed for VMware VM object property access and type handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Its complexity is typical for SDK compatibility code, and there are no indicators of malicious intent.",
