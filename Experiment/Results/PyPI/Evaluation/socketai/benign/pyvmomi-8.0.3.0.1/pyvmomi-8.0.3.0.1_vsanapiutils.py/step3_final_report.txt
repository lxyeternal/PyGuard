{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for vSAN API stub creation, version management, and task handling, facilitating vSAN system interactions.",
  "sources": "Network request to fetch 'vsanServiceVersions.xml' over HTTPS, reading SSL context, and input parameters for stub creation.",
  "sinks": "Fetching remote XML data, constructing API stubs, and managing tasks; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects identified.",
  "flows": "Network request to remote URL -> parse XML -> determine version -> create vSAN API stubs -> manage tasks.",
  "anomalies": "Insecure SSL context override (`ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_https_context`) which disables SSL verification, exposing MITM risks.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs vSAN API stubs for vCenter and ESXi, manages vSAN-related systems, and retrieves version info via network. No malicious routines, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only security concern is disabling SSL verification, which is a common but insecure practice. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate vSAN management functions. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident. The network fetch and SSL override are standard but should be addressed for production security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for vSAN API interactions with a minor security concern due to insecure SSL handling. No malicious intent or malicious code is detected. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, reflecting the insecure SSL context override but not malicious behavior.",
