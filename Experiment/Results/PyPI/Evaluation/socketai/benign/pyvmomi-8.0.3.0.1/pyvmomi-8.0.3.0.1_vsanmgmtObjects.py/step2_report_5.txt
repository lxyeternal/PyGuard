  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a comment header with no executable logic, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - Confirmed: There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code present in the snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of code, data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code is just a comment, this is justified.\n   - No reason to increase the risk score because there's no executable code or potential attack vector.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports assign malware score = 0.\n   - This is correct; comments cannot be malicious unless they contain obfuscated or hidden code, which they do not.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made beyond the straightforward observation that this is just a comment header.\n   - All reasoning is based on observable facts.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code snippet is purely a comment with no executable or data-processing content. It poses no security risk, no malware, and no obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. Given the code's nature, I concur with their assessments. No adjustments are necessary.",
