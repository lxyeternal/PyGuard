  "analysis": "The code is limited to header comments indicating copyright ownership. There is no actual code, input reading, data processing, or potentially malicious behavior. Given the lack of executable content, there are no source, sink, or flow elements to analyze. This is typical boilerplate license text with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet contains only licensing comments with no executable or malicious code present. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected. The code is benign.",
