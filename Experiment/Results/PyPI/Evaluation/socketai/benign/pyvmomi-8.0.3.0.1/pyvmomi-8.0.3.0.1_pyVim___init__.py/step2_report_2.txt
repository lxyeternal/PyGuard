  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. All reports correctly identify that the code contains only comments with no executable code, data flows, or logic. They consistently conclude that there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present.\n\n2. The scores assigned to obfuscated code (0 or 0.0), malware (0), and security risk (0) are appropriate given the absence of any executable or suspicious content.\n\n3. Since the reports are uniform and accurate in their assessments, there is no reason to adjust the scores.\n\n4. The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the fact that only comments are present. No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n\n5. The risk scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the lack of any code or data processing.\n\n6. The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate because the assessment is straightforward: only comments are present.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — only comments, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code snippet is benign and contains no security concerns.",
