  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided code contains only comments with no executable code, data handling, or logic. There are no source, sink, or flow points, and no anomalies or malicious activity detected.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; no issues are present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly emphasizing the absence of executable code and malicious activity.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, since only comments)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct, no security concerns)\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the snippet.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is appropriate because there's no executable code or data flow.\n   - No report suggests any reason to assign a higher risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - Since there's no executable code, data handling, or suspicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities, focusing solely on the visible content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The snippet is purely a comment with no executable or malicious content. The security posture is benign, and no risks or malware are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.",
