  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for monitoring, waiting on, and managing VMware vSphere tasks via the pyVmomi SDK, including progress updates, error handling, and filtering.",
  "sources": "Reads task.info, task.info.progress, task.info.entity, and task.info.error; user-provided callbacks for logging and progress updates.",
  "sinks": "Logs messages, raises exceptions on errors or blocked tasks, invokes user callbacks for progress updates.",
  "flows": "Polls task status via GetTaskStatus, updates progress, handles errors, and manages filters for task monitoring.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard pyVmomi SDK functions for task monitoring and management. It includes proper exception handling, filtering, and progress callbacks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical SDK usage. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to exception handling and callback execution, which are standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate VMware task management utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are accurate and appropriate.",
