  "purpose": "Implement a caching decorator for functions with cache reset capability.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (args and kwargs) used to generate cache keys.",
  "sinks": "Function call results stored in __cached__ attribute; cache reset method modifies __cached__.",
  "flows": "Arguments are used to generate cache key -> cache is checked/updated -> function result returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'or None' in key construction could lead to ambiguous cache keys; no thread safety measures.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward cache decorator attaching a cache dictionary to the function object. Cache keys are constructed from args and kwargs, with potential issues if args are empty or None, but generally hashable. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The cache reset method is attached but not exposed via decorator syntax. No security vulnerabilities are evident; the main concern is thread safety in concurrent environments. The reports are empty, providing no additional findings or issues. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior suggest a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score around 0.1 due to minor concurrency considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard caching decorator with minor correctness and thread safety considerations. The reports are empty and do not identify any issues. Therefore, there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
