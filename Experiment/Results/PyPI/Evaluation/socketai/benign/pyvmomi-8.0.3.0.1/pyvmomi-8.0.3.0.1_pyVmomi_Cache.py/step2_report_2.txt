  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears to implement a caching decorator correctly, with a cache reset method.\n   - No malicious or obfuscated code is evident.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are all empty (\"Empty response\") and provide no details about potential issues.\n   - Without specific content, I cannot identify errors or flaws in the reports themselves.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - Since all reports are empty, and no issues are described, the risk, malware, or obfuscation scores should logically be zero.\n   - If any scores are assigned higher than zero without justification, they should be reconsidered.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation is present.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should be minimal or zero.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No suspicious behavior or code patterns are present.\n   - Malware score should be zero.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - Since no details are provided, any assumptions about vulnerabilities are unwarranted.\n   - The code appears safe and well-structured.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - Given the lack of content, scores should be uniformly low or zero.\n   - Any higher scores are unjustified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports lack content, so no issues are identified. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores should reflect this, with all being zero.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nRequest more detailed reports to enable proper review. As it stands, the current data indicates no security concerns.",
