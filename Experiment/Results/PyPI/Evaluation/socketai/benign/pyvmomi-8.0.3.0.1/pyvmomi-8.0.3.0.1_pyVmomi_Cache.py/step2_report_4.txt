  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Presence of Issues:**\n   - The provided code is a decorator for caching function results.\n   - The implementation appears generally correct, with a key construction based on positional and keyword arguments.\n   - The cache is stored as an attribute `__cached__` on the function, and a reset method `__resetcache__` is provided.\n   - No obvious security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident from this code snippet.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary:**\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no detailed analysis or findings.\n   - Since no actual report content is provided, I cannot identify specific issues or false claims within those reports.\n   - The absence of detailed responses prevents validation or critique of any supposed vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - Without detailed report content, I cannot evaluate the accuracy of the scores assigned.\n   - If the reports claimed vulnerabilities or malware, but provided no evidence or analysis, their scores might be unjustified.\n   - Conversely, if the reports were claiming this code is malicious or vulnerable without basis, their scores should be lowered.\n\n4. **Malware and Risk Scores:**\n   - The code appears benign and standard.\n   - No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n   - Therefore, malware score should be very low or zero.\n   - Risk score should also be minimal unless there's an undisclosed context.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Since reports contain no details, I cannot evaluate whether their claims are assumption-based or evidence-based.\n   - Any assumption that this code is malicious or vulnerable without evidence should be challenged.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Without specific scores provided, I recommend that:\n     - Malware score be set to 0.\n     - Obfuscated score be set to 0.\n     - Risk score be very low, e.g., 0.1 or less, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code itself is not problematic.\n   - The reports lack content; therefore, no issues can be confirmed.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports (if any) should be reviewed critically, likely lowered unless justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on the available information, I estimate:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0.1 (or similarly low)\n\nThis is a conservative assessment given the absence of evidence suggesting malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
