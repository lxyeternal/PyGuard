  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The provided code is a cache decorator implementation in Python.\n   - The code appears syntactically correct and implements a caching mechanism with a reset function.\n   - There are no obvious security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors in this code snippet.\n   - Since the reports are empty (\"Empty response\"), there's no additional context or claims to evaluate.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic, Reasoning, or Summary**:\n   - All reports are empty, indicating no analysis or findings were provided.\n   - Without specific issues reported, it's impossible to identify flaws or mistakes in the report.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - No issues are provided, so no scores are assigned or need to be reviewed.\n   - Any scores assigned would be arbitrary without actual findings.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - Since no issues are reported, the risk score should logically be zero.\n   - The malware score should also be zero, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims About Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims are made, so there's nothing to challenge.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:\n   - With no issues reported, scores should be consistent with a clean bill of health.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Review**: The code itself appears correct and does not contain any obvious security flaws or malicious behavior.\n- **Reported Issues**: None provided; all reports are empty.\n- **Scores**:\n  - **Malware Score**: 0.0 (no malicious activity detected or claimed)\n  - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n  - **Risk Score**: 0.0 (no issues reported, no vulnerabilities identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the lack of detailed reports, I recommend no escalation or concern based solely on this data.\n- If future reports provide specific issues, a more thorough review would be necessary.\n\n**Summary**: The code is clean, and with no issues reported, the overall risk and malware scores should remain at zero.",
