{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures the Python package 'pyvmomi', including dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', 'test-requirements.txt', 'README.rst', and file system walks for package data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling points observed.",
  "flows": "Reading files (requirements, test requirements, README) -> processing and passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic behaviors observed. The code appears to follow standard packaging procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations for a Python package: reading dependencies, gathering package data, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input data that could lead to security issues were detected. The functions are straightforward, and all data sources are static files or directories used in packaging. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script for 'pyvmomi'. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It follows conventional practices for Python package configuration.",
