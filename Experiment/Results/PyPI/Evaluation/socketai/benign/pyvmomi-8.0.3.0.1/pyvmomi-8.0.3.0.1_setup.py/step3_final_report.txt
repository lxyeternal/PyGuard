  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging the pyvmomi SDK, reading local files for metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', 'test-requirements.txt', and package files within 'pyVmomi' directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reading static files and directory traversal to gather package data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reads, directory traversal for package data, and invokes setuptools.setup() with static, trusted data. No dynamic execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unwarranted given the benign nature of the code. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign setup configuration for the pyvmomi SDK. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The security risk is effectively zero.",
