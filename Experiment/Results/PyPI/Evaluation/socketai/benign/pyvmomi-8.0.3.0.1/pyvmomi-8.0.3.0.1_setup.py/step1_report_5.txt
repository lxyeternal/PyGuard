{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the 'pyvmomi' Python SDK package, including dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads files such as 'requirements.txt', 'test-requirements.txt', and 'README.rst'; reads package files in the 'pyVmomi' directory; reads input from the environment via 'os' module.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'open' to read files; calls 'setup' function with package configuration; no other direct sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads dependency lists from files and package data from directory traversal; feeds data into 'setup' for package distribution; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs standard package setup tasks without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for Python package distribution, including reading static files, configuring package metadata, and defining dependencies. It uses typical 'os' and 'setuptools' functions without any dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious data handling. No external inputs are directly used in a way that could cause security risks. The code does not include any network activity, credential handling, or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It only reads static files and sets up package metadata for distribution. There are no anomalies or suspicious activities identified.",
