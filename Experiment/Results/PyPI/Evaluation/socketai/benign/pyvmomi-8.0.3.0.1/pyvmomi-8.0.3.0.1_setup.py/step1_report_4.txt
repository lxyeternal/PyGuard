{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the pyvmomi Python SDK package for distribution, including reading dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads from files ('requirements.txt', 'test-requirements.txt', 'README.rst'), environment variables (indirectly via os.path and open), and package files in 'pyVmomi'.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code mainly performs file I/O, package metadata definition, and setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads external files to gather dependencies and package data, then uses setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing only safe modules (os, setuptools). It reads dependency lists and package data, then invokes setup() with metadata. No untrusted input processing or potentially malicious code exists. The code does not contain obfuscated parts or external code execution. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It solely performs package setup tasks without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
