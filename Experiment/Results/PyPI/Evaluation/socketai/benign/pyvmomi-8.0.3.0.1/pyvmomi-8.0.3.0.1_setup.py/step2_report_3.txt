  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims and scores, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script is a setup configuration for packaging; reads local files and directories.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code, no dynamic behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup process.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard setup script.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external connections.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, reads files, no external code execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected, but notes a securityRisk of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, as the code is standard but the presence of file reads and setup process could, in theory, be misused, though no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, reads static files, no dynamic input.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no external network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior. The code only reads local files and directories, performs package setup, and does not execute any untrusted code or network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation patterns.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Almost all reports assign 0, except report 4, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, a very low security risk score (e.g., 0.0 or 0.05) is more appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.05 (to acknowledge the minimal risk associated with file I/O in setup scripts, but not malicious)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation.**",
