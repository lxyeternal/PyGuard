{
  "purpose": "The code segments a text document into paragraphs, sentences, and tokens, with options to process hyphenated words and preserve text offsets.",
  "sources": "Reading input document from command line arguments, files, or stdin; using regex to split paragraphs; tokenization via syntok.tokenizer.Tokenizer.",
  "sinks": "Outputting tokenized sentences to stdout; no data sinks like network, file, or database writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input text is read, split into paragraphs, tokens are generated via the Tokenizer, and sentences are yielded for printing; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code relies on external libraries (syntok, regex) and standard I/O; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs text segmentation tasks by leveraging the syntok tokenizer and regex for paragraph splitting. It processes input from files or stdin, tokenizes the text, and outputs tokenized sentences. No data is transmitted over the network or stored insecurely. The only potential concern could be reliance on external libraries, but these are standard and widely used. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate text processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard text segmentation utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input reading, tokenization, and output display without data leaks or harmful actions.",
