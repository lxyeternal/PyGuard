{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for text segmentation, splitting documents into paragraphs, sentences, and tokens, and handling hyphenation and offsets. It primarily processes textual data for linguistic analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from command line arguments (file paths or stdin), and uses the 'document' parameter in functions such as 'analyze', 'process', 'preprocess', and 'preprocess_with_offsets'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any sensitive data leaks, network communication, or write to external systems. It processes data in-memory and outputs tokenized sentences to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files or stdin; text is split into paragraphs; paragraphs are tokenized; tokens are segmented into sentences; sentences are output as strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python modules, third-party 'regex' and 'syntok' libraries, and typical data processing patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs text segmentation tasks without any network calls, file modifications, or external system interactions. It uses well-known libraries for tokenization and segmentation. There are no indications of malicious payloads or secret data handling. The functions are standard and do not contain any suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward text processing utility aimed at segmentation and tokenization for linguistic purposes. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and suitable for use in natural language processing pipelines.",
