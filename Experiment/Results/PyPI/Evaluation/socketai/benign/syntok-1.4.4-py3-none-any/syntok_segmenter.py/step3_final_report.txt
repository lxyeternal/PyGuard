{
  "purpose": "The code segments text documents into paragraphs, sentences, and tokens using standard NLP libraries, without external untrusted sources beyond input files or stdin.",
  "sources": "Input text from files or stdin, processed internally with no external data leaks or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Outputs tokenized sentences to stdout, with no external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input text → tokenization and segmentation functions → output sentences to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs straightforward NLP processing with standard libraries (`regex`, `syntok`). It reads input, processes paragraphs and sentences, and outputs tokenized sentences. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are well-structured, and the logic is predictable and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP utility for text segmentation with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
