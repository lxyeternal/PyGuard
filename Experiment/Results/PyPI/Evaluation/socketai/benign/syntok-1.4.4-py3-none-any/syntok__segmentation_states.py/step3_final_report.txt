{
  "purpose": "The code implements a sentence boundary detection state machine for NLP, processing tokens from an iterator, managing internal queues and states to segment sentences accurately.",
  "sources": "Input tokens read from an iterator stream, accessed via the _stream property.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could be tokens that influence state transitions or token classification, but no external data sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Tokens are fetched from the stream into the queue; state transitions depend on token values, brackets, punctuation, and context, with source-to-sink flow confined within token processing and state changes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious operations detected. Extensive set definitions for linguistic features are standard for NLP tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive NLP sentence segmentation state machine, managing tokens, brackets, abbreviations, numerals, and sentence starters. It uses standard techniques, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The logic is consistent, and the code is transparent and well-structured. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified based on the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign NLP component for sentence boundary detection. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores and low malware/security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
