  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a utility or script for handling data, possibly involving user input or external data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input, environment variables, or external files",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, logs, or external servers; possibly writes to files or databases",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env/file) to sinks (output/logging/storage), possibly passing through transformations or validations",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data or environment variables, processes it, and outputs or logs results. No malicious system calls, network connections, or dangerous eval/exec usage are evident. No embedded hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments are present. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and not suspicious in isolation. No anomalies such as backdoors or privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script without malicious intent. It performs typical data processing tasks securely, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
