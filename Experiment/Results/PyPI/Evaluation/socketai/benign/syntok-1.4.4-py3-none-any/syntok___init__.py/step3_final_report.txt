  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network calls, file I/O, user input, external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, subprocess calls, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks through code logic, data processing, and external calls.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code snippets; all reports indicate no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe benign code with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate across reports. Security risk scores of 0.2 reflect minimal concern, aligning with benign descriptions. High confidence levels are justified where code is present; low confidence where code is missing. The assessments are internally consistent and appropriately cautious given the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. Scores are justified and consistent with descriptions. No adjustments are necessary based on current data.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
