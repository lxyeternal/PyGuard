  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, but the exact intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, imported modules, and potentially user-provided inputs or network data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or data leaks via printing or logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like network or file operations, possibly passing through transformations or evaluations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious obfuscation or malicious code patterns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious domain connections were detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed step-by-step: initial imports and environment reads, execution of functions, and output handling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as unauthorized data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, were found. No suspicious network calls or file modifications were observed. The code appears standard and benign based on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this review, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a typical, benign Python script without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
