{
  "purpose": "A regex-based tokenizer for linguistic processing, splitting input text into tokens while handling hyphens, apostrophes, punctuation, and Unicode whitespace.",
  "sources": "Input text from files or stdin, read via the tokenize() method.",
  "sinks": "Outputs tokenized strings to stdout; no external system modifications or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input text → regex splitting → tokens with spacing and offsets → output tokens as reconstructed text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Regex patterns are standard for NLP tokenization.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a comprehensive NLP tokenizer using regex to handle various linguistic features. It reads input, processes it into tokens with associated spacing and offsets, and outputs tokenized text. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. The regex patterns, while complex, are typical for linguistic tokenization and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The code structure is clear, and no suspicious behaviors such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured NLP tokenizer with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It processes input text safely and efficiently, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the overall security assessment is benign.",
