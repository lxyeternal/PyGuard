{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to tokenize input text into smaller units called Tokens, handling various punctuation, whitespace, and special characters for text processing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text from command line arguments (files) or standard input (stdin). It also reads pattern matches within the text during tokenization, such as whitespace, punctuation, and special characters.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs tokenized text by joining token values, primarily to the console or files, but does not write or transmit untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input text flows from files or stdin into the tokenizer, which processes and yields tokens. Tokens are then joined into strings and printed. There are no external network or data transmission sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive regex matching and token splitting but does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No malicious code or payloads are evident. The only notable feature is the 'replace_not_contraction' option that replaces \"n't\" with \"not\" or leaves it as is, which is a benign transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a text tokenizer that uses multiple regex patterns to split text into tokens based on whitespace, punctuation, hyphens, apostrophes, and other delimiters. It manages token offsets and spacing to allow reconstruction of original text. No external network access, system modifications, or data leaks are present. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation, and only performs text processing functions. The only feature that modifies token content is the optional contraction replacement, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured tokenizer intended for text processing. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The design focuses solely on tokenizing input text with configurable options for hyphen and contraction handling.",
