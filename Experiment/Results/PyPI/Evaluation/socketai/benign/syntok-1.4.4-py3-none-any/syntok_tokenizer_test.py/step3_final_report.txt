{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the syntok.tokenizer module, verifying tokenization, punctuation handling, hyphenation, offsets, and text reconstruction.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'tokenizer_test.txt' file and accesses class variables such as _hyphens and _apostrophes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network/system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from file flows into tokenizer.split() and Tokenizer.to_text(), with outputs compared to expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of a tokenizer library, involving file I/O, string processing, and assertions. No malicious or malicious-looking code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The tests rely on local test data files, which is typical for such testing environments. No external network activity or system modifications are observed. The code structure and logic are clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for a tokenizer module, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
