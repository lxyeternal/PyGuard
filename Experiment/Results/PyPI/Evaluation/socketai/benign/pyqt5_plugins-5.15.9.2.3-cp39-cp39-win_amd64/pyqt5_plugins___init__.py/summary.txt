  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment setup routine for Qt/PyQt applications, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The placeholder comments are benign and likely internal markers. The overall supply chain security posture is safe, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
