  "purpose": "Dynamically imports PyQt and Qt modules, and defines a custom widget plugin for Qt Designer.",
  "sources": "The code reads package distribution versions, segment strings for dynamic imports, and class instantiation for custom widgets.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import statements and class methods that instantiate and return widgets or icons.",
  "flows": "Imports package versions -> constructs module names -> dynamically imports modules -> defines plugin class -> creates widget instances.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the use of dynamic string formatting for module imports and class names, which is common in plugin systems but could hide malicious intent if misused. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The comment with CAMPid seems unrelated and possibly an obfuscation or tracking attempt but has no direct malicious impact.",
  "analysis": "The code uses version-based string formatting for import paths, which is a common practice in versioned plugin systems. It dynamically imports modules and defines a Qt Designer plugin class. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code segments are evident. The dynamic import mechanism itself is not inherently malicious but could be exploited if the module names are manipulated, which is unlikely here as they are constructed from controlled strings and the package version. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Qt Designer plugin with dynamic module loading based on the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The use of dynamic import strings appears intentional for version management, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
