{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports specific PyQt and Qt modules based on the major version and defines a custom widget plugin for Qt Designer.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from package resources, dynamic import statements, use of class attributes to access plugin components.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network access, file writing, or system commands detected.",
  "flows": "Uses version info to construct module names for import, then creates widget instances and plugin metadata for Qt Designer.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a TODO comment with a suspicious numeric string. Usage of dynamic import based on package version is uncommon but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No external network activity or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the package's major version to dynamically import specific modules, then defines a plugin class for Qt Designer that creates and describes a custom widget. The dynamic import mechanism may be unconventional but appears intended for compatibility across different Qt/PyQt versions. The code's structure is typical for plugin definitions, with no signs of malicious activity. No external data access, system modification, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard PyQt plugin implementation that uses dynamic imports based on package version. No malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks are evident. It is a legitimate plugin definition with no indications of malware or security issues.",
