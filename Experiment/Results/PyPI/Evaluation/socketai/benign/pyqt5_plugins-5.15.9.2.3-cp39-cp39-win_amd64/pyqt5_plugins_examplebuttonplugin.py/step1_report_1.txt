{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports and integrates a custom PyQt widget plugin into a Qt Designer environment.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution, importlib.import_module, import_it function, and class methods.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to external data leakage or unsafe actions; the code primarily handles plugin creation and registration within the environment.",
  "flows": "The code reads package version info to dynamically import modules, then uses imported modules to create and register a custom widget plugin with Qt Designer.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a TODO comment with a suspicious numeric string, but it appears to be a placeholder or comment. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns are detected. Dynamic imports are based solely on version info, which is typical for plugin management.",
  "analysis": "The script determines the major version of the current package using pkg_resources, then uses this to construct module names for import. It imports core PyQt modules and a specific plugin module. The class 'ExampleButtonPlugin' defines a custom Qt Designer widget plugin, implementing necessary methods to initialize, identify, and instantiate the custom widget. The code appears to be a standard plugin registration script, with dynamic module handling based on version info, which is common in modular plugin systems. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. The initial comment and string formatting are benign and seem related to project-specific identification or versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical PyQt custom widget plugin loader with dynamic imports based on package versioning. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The use of dynamic imports and plugin registration appears standard and safe within the context of a plugin system.",
