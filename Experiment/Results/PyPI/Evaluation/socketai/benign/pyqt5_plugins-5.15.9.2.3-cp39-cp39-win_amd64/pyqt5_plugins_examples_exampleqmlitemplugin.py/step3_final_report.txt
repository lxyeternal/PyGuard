  "purpose": "Dynamically imports PyQt and Qt modules based on version variables and registers a QML extension type.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module calls constructing module names from controlled variables; debug logs; exception handling during imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration; standard module import and registration flows.",
  "flows": "Source: dynamic import string construction -> importlib.import_module; sink: QtQml.qmlRegisterType registration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import strings based on version variables; extensive debug output; TODO comments indicating incomplete code; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled dynamic imports based on version variables, with exception handling and verbose debug logs. No suspicious activity, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The dynamic import logic is predictable and not influenced by external untrusted input. The registration of QML types is standard. The debug logs are benign. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The exception handling is appropriate. Overall, the code is a benign plugin loader with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader for PyQt/QML with controlled dynamic imports and debug logging. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0. The overall assessment is that this code is benign and safe for use.",
