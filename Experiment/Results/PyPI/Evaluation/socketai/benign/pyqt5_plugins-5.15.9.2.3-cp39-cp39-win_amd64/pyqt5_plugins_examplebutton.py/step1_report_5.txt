{
  "purpose": "Define a custom PyQt button class that uses dynamic import and string formatting for the button text.",
  "sources": "import_it function call for dynamic module import, and format string in setText method.",
  "sinks": "setText method could potentially inject untrusted data if 'major' was untrusted, but 'major' appears to be a static import.",
  "flows": "import_it loads PyQt.QtWidgets, which is used to create a QPushButton; setText uses 'major' to format button label.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import function 'import_it' might be suspicious if it's designed to load modules dynamically, but no malicious activity is evident here; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules via a custom import_it function, likely for modularity or dynamic loading. It then defines a subclass of QtWidgets.QPushButton, initializing it with a parent widget. The button text includes a formatted string incorporating 'major', which is imported from another module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward and intended for GUI element creation, with no external data sources or sinks indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple PyQt GUI class definition with dynamic module import and string formatting. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident. It appears to be legitimate application code.",
