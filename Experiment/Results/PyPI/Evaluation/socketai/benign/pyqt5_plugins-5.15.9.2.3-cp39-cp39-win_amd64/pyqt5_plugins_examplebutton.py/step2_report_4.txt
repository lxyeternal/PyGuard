  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code snippet.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom . import import_it\nfrom . import major\n\nQtWidgets = import_it(\"PyQt\", \"QtWidgets\")\n\n\nclass ExampleButton(QtWidgets.QPushButton):\n    def __init__(self, parent):\n        super().__init__(parent)\n        self.setText('pyqt{}-tools Example Button'.format(major))\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines a custom QPushButton with dynamic text based on 'major'.\n- **Sources:** Importing local modules `.import_it` and `.major`, dynamic import of `PyQt.QtWidgets`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; straightforward code; dynamic import is unusual but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious activity.  \n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature; perhaps 0.1 would be more appropriate.  \n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; dynamic import is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly notes no malicious activity.  \n- The security risk score again seems slightly high but acceptable.  \n- Malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n\n- **Error:** JSON parse error, but the embedded content appears consistent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; dynamic import is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The low security risk score (0.1) aligns well with the benign analysis.  \n- Malware score is 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly identifies the code as benign.  \n- Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Observations & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no network activity, no code injection, no data exfiltration, or suspicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1–0.2). Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators, a risk score of **0.1** would be more fitting across the board.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- The use of a custom import function `import_it` is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. Its presence warrants a cautious risk score, but not a high one, unless further context suggests malicious intent.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable, though slightly conservative regarding security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary & My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** (minimal risk, mainly due to dynamic import pattern, but no evidence of malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe and benign. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the observed code behavior.",
