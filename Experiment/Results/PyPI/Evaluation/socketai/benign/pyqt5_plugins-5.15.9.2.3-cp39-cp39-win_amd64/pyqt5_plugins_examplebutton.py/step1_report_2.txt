{
  "purpose": "Define a custom PyQt button class with dynamic text based on imported 'major' version.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'import_it' and 'major'; use of import_it to load 'PyQt' QtWidgets module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, dynamically importing QtWidgets, then creating a GUI widget with text that includes 'major' version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom import function 'import_it' for dynamic import; no explicit malicious behavior but unusual pattern for standard PyQt code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an 'import_it' function and 'major' variable, then dynamically imports the QtWidgets module from PyQt. It defines a subclass of QPushButton that sets its text to include the 'major' version. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The dynamic import could be used maliciously if 'import_it' is malicious, but based solely on this code snippet, it appears to be intended for modular or version-based loading. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious actions are evident. The code structure is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard PyQt widget subclass with dynamic text. While the use of 'import_it' is unusual, it does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No malware or security risks are evident within this fragment.",
