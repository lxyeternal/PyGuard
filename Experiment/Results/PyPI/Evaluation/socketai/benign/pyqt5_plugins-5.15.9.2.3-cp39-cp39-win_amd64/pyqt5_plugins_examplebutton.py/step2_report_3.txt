  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code snippet shows a straightforward PyQt subclass with dynamic text based on an imported 'major' variable.\n- All reports mention the use of a custom 'import_it' function to load 'QtWidgets' from 'PyQt' and a 'major' variable.\n- No evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation in the code.\n\n**Step 2: Identify logical flaws or errors in reports**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and straightforward.\n- One report mentions a \"JSON parse error\" — this appears to be a raw response formatting issue, not an issue with the code itself.\n- No contradictions or inaccuracies in the reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned**\n\n- Confidence scores are high (0.8–0.9), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), aligning with the conclusion that the code is benign.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk or malware scores**\n\n- Since all analyses find no malicious behavior, malware score should remain at 0.\n- Security risk is low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- No reason to increase scores unless evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities appears.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions**\n\n- The only potential concern is the use of 'import_it' — if this function is malicious or used maliciously, it could be a vector. However, the reports acknowledge this and find no evidence.\n- The code's dynamic import pattern is unusual but not malicious.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, low security risk, high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (appropriate, minimal risk, benign code)  \n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The only minor point is the unusual use of dynamic import, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, benign code)  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
