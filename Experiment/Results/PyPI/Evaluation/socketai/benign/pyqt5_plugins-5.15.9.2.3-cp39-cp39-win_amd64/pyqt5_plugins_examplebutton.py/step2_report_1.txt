  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  The code is straightforward: importing local modules, dynamically importing `QtWidgets`, defining a subclass that sets button text based on `major`. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The report notes the unusual use of `import_it`, but clarifies it isn't inherently malicious. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (mild, considering dynamic import)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (justified)  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity or data leaks. The use of `import_it` is noted as unusual but not suspicious.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity. The report appropriately dismisses potential concerns.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8 (justified)  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  The report mentions a JSON parse error, but the raw response included appears valid. Likely a formatting or parsing mistake in the report. The code itself, as described, is benign.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The report's mention of a parse error seems to be an error in the report itself, not the code. The analysis correctly states no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (reasonable)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (justified)  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Same as previous, straightforward code with no signs of malicious activity. The use of `import_it` is noted but not suspicious.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Similar to others, no malicious behavior detected. The dynamic import and string formatting are benign in context.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The report correctly interprets the code as legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.2) in some reports due to the use of dynamic import (`import_it`). This is a minor concern but not inherently malicious. Given the benign nature of the code, I would suggest lowering it to 0.1 across all reports for consistency.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** Reduce from 0.2 to **0.1** in all reports to reflect that the dynamic import is unusual but not dangerous.\n- **Confidence:** Maintain high confidence (0.9) given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The use of dynamic import is noted but not malicious. The scores should be consistent and slightly conservative regarding the security risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis and the evidence provided.",
