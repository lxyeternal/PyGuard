{
  "purpose": "Define a custom PyQt QPushButton class with dynamic text based on imported 'major' version.",
  "sources": "Importing local modules '.import_it' and '.major', and dynamic import of PyQt.QtWidgets.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leak or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are evident; data flows from module imports to class instantiation without external input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import via 'import_it' is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules, uses a custom import function 'import_it' to dynamically load 'QtWidgets' from 'PyQt', then defines a QPushButton subclass that sets its text based on a 'major' version variable. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The structure is straightforward, and the only potentially unusual element is dynamic import, which is not suspicious by itself. No external input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily defining a GUI component with dynamic text. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
