{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom PyQt button class that dynamically sets its text based on an imported 'major' value.",
  "sources": "Importing 'import_it' module and 'major' variable; calling import_it to load PyQt 'QtWidgets'.",
  "sinks": "self.setText() method, which sets the button label; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "import_it('PyQt', 'QtWidgets') → usage of QtWidgets.QPushButton → setting button text with formatted string involving 'major'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom import mechanism 'import_it'; no obvious malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The dynamic text formatting is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and a variable using a custom import function, then defines a QPushButton subclass that sets its label dynamically based on 'major'. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is the use of 'import_it', which could be misused, but within this snippet, it appears to be benign and intended for modular imports. Overall, the code is straightforward and typical for PyQt GUI components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple GUI component definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard pattern for dynamic UI labels using imported configuration.",
