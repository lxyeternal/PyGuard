{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports PyQt's QtWidgets module using a custom import function and defines a subclass of QPushButton with text that incorporates a version or major indicator.",
  "sources": "Local modules '.import_it' and '.major'; dynamic import of 'PyQt.QtWidgets' via 'import_it'; usage of 'major' in string formatting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network activity, data leaks, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Source: import_it function and 'major' variable; Sink: setting button text with formatted string; Flow: dynamic import and string formatting used for UI element.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a custom dynamic import function 'import_it' instead of static import; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward dynamic import of a QtWidgets module and defines a UI button subclass with text based on a variable. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import pattern is uncommon but not inherently malicious. No external network activity or sensitive data handling occurs. The use of 'import_it' and 'major' is benign in this context. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting the unusual import pattern but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The dynamic import is unusual but not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is straightforward and safe for use. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
