It then defines a class 'ExampleButton' inheriting from 'QtWidgets.QPushButton', setting its text with a format that includes 'major'. There are no network operations, no data leaks, or obfuscated code. The dynamic import function 'import_it' might be scrutinized for malicious activity, but based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The class appears to be a simple GUI component with dynamic labeling.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a straightforward PyQt widget subclass with dynamic text.
