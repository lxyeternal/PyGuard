Reports 1 and 2 warrant cautious attention due to eval/exec and network activity, suggesting malware scores around 0.35-0.4. Benign reports are correctly scored at 0 or 0.2. Overall, the security posture appears low risk, with no confirmed malicious payloads, but vigilance is advised for reports indicating dynamic code execution."
