  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for extracting version information from git repositories. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond the inherent minimal risk associated with subprocess calls in trusted environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1)."
