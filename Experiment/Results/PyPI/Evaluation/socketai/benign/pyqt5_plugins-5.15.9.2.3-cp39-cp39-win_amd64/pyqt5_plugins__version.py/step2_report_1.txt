  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard version extraction from git, environment variables, files, directory structure.\n- **Sinks:** External git commands via subprocess, no network or file writes.\n- **Flows:** Input from environment/files, subprocess outputs, regex parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses subprocess to run external commands, but this is typical for versioning tools.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is a standard version extraction utility.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, typical for subprocess usage)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate version extraction code, safe, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher but still very low, due to subprocess use)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on version extraction via files and subprocess calls, standard practices.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar pattern: subprocess calls, file reads, directory checks.\n- No malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard version management code, safe.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Same overall pattern: subprocess calls, directory inspections, no signs of malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard, well-structured version extraction utility. No malicious payloads, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting subprocess usage, but these are standard for such tools and do not indicate security risks.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code. The code's purpose is benign.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as zero across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — reflecting subprocess usage, but this is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, standard for such tooling.\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and legitimate.
