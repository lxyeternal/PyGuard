{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract version information from a git repository or source tree, primarily for use in source distributions and build processes.",
  "sources": "Reads version keywords from files (e.g., _version.py), environment variables, and directory names; executes external git commands via subprocess to gather repository state.",
  "sinks": "External subprocess calls to git commands; no network or file writing; regex parsing of command outputs.",
  "flows": "Input from files and environment variables; subprocess outputs parsed with regex; directory heuristics used to infer version info.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to invoke external commands, which could be manipulated if environment is compromised, but this is standard for version control tooling; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard version extraction tasks using subprocess calls to git CLI tools, regex parsing, and directory heuristics. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are controlled and do not process untrusted user input. The code is well-structured and typical for such utilities, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for extracting version information from git repositories. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond the inherent minimal risk associated with subprocess calls in trusted environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1).",
