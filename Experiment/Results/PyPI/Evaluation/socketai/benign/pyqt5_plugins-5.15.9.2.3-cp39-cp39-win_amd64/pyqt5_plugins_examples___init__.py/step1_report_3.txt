  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, but without additional context or comments, the exact goal is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; the code does not show reading from network, files, environment variables, or user input.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present. There are no obvious points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly consists of definitions and straightforward operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code structure is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. It does not perform network communication, file manipulation, or sensitive data handling. No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic execution or embedded backdoors, are present. The absence of external data sources and sinks suggests it is likely benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a typical utility or processing script with no evident security concerns.",
