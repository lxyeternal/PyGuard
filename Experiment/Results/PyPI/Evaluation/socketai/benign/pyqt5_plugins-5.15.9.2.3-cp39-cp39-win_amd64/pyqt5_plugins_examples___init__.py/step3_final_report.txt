  "purpose": "Review open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, imported modules, system commands, network calls, and any untrusted data flows.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, data exfiltration points, environment variables, and file modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like system commands or network transmissions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets across all reports show no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The assessments are cautious, acknowledging limitations due to incomplete snippets but consistently conclude benign behavior. Malware scores are zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting minimal but acknowledged potential concerns. Confidence levels are appropriate given the context. No anomalies or suspicious flows are identified. The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent with the scores assigned.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippets and analyses, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security posture is benign, with minimal risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the assessments. No adjustments are necessary.",
