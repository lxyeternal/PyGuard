  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and define a path to Swagger UI resources within a package.",
  "sources": "importlib_resources or importlib (for resource access), Path (for filesystem path handling).",
  "sinks": "Path object creation, which could be used for file access, but in this context is standard resource location.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> Determine resource path -> Assign Path to variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of importlib_resources is appropriate for resource access. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a module for accessing package resources, compatible with multiple Python versions. It then constructs a path to a specific resource within the 'swagger_ui_bundle' package. This is a typical pattern for resource management and does not involve any data flow from untrusted sources or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for accessing package resources and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and correctly structured for its purpose.",
