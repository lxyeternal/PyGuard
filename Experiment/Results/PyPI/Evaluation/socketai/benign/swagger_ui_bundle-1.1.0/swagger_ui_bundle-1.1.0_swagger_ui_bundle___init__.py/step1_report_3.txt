{
  "purpose": "The code aims to import a package for resource management and define a file path to a Swagger UI bundle resource.",
  "sources": "The import statements read modules 'importlib_resources' or 'importlib.resources'. The 'swagger_ui_path' variable reads the resource location using 'importlib_resources.files'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the access to resource files via 'importlib_resources.files', which could be exploited if the resource path is manipulated or if the package is maliciously replaced, but in this context, it appears to be a straightforward resource access.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules based on Python version, then constructs a file path from the package resource 'swagger_ui_bundle'. The path is used to locate Swagger UI assets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code adapts to different Python versions correctly and performs standard resource path resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard way to handle package resource paths with compatibility for Python versions before 3.9. No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The resource path is fixed to a known package resource, indicating standard resource handling. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and legitimate, used for locating static resource files within a package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
