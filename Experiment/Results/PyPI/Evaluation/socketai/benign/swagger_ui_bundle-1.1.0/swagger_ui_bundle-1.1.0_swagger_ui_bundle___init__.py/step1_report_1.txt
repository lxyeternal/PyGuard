{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import a resource management library and set a path to the 'swagger_ui_bundle' vendor files, likely for serving or accessing Swagger UI assets.",
  "sources": "Import statements for importlib_resources or importlib.resources, and the assignment to 'swagger_ui_path' using the importlib_resources.files() method.",
  "sinks": "The assignment to 'swagger_ui_path' could be a sink if the resulting Path object is used in a way that accesses untrusted file paths, but in this code snippet, it's only setting a variable.",
  "flows": "Import of resource management library -> determination of resource files path -> assignment to 'swagger_ui_path'. No data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed. The code simply manages resource paths; it does not handle user input, network data, or execute code dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports a module for resource access, compatible with different Python versions. It then constructs a Path object pointing to static Swagger UI files within a package. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. It appears to be standard resource path setup for serving or accessing static assets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for accessing static Swagger UI assets. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
