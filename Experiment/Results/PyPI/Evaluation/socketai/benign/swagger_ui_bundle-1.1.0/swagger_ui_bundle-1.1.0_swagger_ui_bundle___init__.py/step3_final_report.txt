  "purpose": "Set up a resource path to static Swagger UI assets within the 'swagger_ui_bundle' package, with compatibility handling for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import of importlib_resources or importlib.resources, and the files() method to locate the resource directory.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of the Path object to 'swagger_ui_path' without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Import of resource management module -> retrieval of resource directory -> construction of Path object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static, with no dynamic execution or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import with a fallback for older Python versions, then constructs a Path to static assets within a package. No user input, network activity, or code injection is present. The resource path is fixed and used for static asset access, indicating no malicious intent. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for accessing static resources within a package. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.1) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
