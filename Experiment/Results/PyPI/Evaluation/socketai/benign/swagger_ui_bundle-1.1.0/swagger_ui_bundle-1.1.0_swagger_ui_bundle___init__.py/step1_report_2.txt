  "purpose": "Load the file path for the Swagger UI bundle resource, possibly for serving documentation or UI in a larger application.",
  "sources": "importlib_resources.files() to access resource files within the 'swagger_ui_bundle' package",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects; static resource path access",
  "flows": "importlib_resources.files() → Path concatenation with '/vendor/swagger-ui-4.15.5'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code dynamically imports a resource accessor based on Python version, which is standard practice. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'importlib_resources' or fallback to 'importlib.resources' depending on Python version, which is typical for compatibility. It then constructs a Path object pointing to a resource directory within the package 'swagger_ui_bundle'. The code only accesses a resource path; no data input, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is present. No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward resource path setup for static assets, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a documentation UI setup.",
