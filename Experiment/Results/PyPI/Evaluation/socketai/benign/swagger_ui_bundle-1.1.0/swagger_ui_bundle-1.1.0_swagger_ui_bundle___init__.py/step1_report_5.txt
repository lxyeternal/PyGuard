  "sinks": "Path construction using the importlib_resources.files() output",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> accessing resource files -> constructing a Path object to a specific directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of importlib_resources is standard for resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for compatibility with Python versions prior to 3.9, importing the appropriate resource management module. It then constructs a Path object pointing to a resource directory within the package 'swagger_ui_bundle'. The purpose appears to be to locate static Swagger UI files. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing resource path resolution for Swagger UI files. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and appears to be a standard resource loading pattern.",
