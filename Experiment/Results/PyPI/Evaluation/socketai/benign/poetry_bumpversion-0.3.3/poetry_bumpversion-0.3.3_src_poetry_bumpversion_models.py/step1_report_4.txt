  "purpose": "Define Pydantic data models for plugin configuration, version instruction processing, and pyproject.toml data structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements, module-level constants, class attributes, default parameter values.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are evident; data models are static and used for configuration parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models using Pydantic, with conditional import handling and default values. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no credential handling. The constants and class attributes are typical for configuration schemas. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration model definitions without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate.",
