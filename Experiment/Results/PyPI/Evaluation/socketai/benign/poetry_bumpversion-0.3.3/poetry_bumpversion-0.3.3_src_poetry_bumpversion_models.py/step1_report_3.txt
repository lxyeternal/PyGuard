  "purpose": "Defines Pydantic models for configuration management and version control in a plugin system.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pydantic library, constants, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; data is used for configuration only.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into Pydantic models for validation and structure but does not lead to any security-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The import fallback is a common pattern for compatibility; no malicious intent apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines data models using Pydantic, with some default constants for version markers. It includes a fallback import for pydantic, which is typical. There are no code injections, network operations, or credential handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of configuration data models with no malicious or security risks.",
