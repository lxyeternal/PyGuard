  "purpose": "Define Pydantic models for plugin configuration and version update instructions in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pydantic library, constants for version markers, class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; code does not process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import handling with fallback, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models using Pydantic for configuration management. The fallback import pattern ensures compatibility if the primary library path is unavailable. All classes are straightforward data containers with default values, no dynamic code execution, or unsafe operations. No external data is processed at runtime, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, intended for configuration modeling, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration module.",
