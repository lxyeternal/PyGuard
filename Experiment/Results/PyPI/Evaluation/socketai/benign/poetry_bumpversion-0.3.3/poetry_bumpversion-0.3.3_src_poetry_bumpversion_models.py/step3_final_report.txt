  "purpose": "Defines Pydantic models for configuration and version update instructions within a plugin system.",
  "sources": "Constants CURRENT_VERSION_MARKER, NEW_VERSION_MARKER; class attributes; fallback import statement for pydantic.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external data processing, no network activity, no code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A – purely declarative data models with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback import pattern for pydantic, which is a common compatibility approach; no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward Pydantic data models used for configuration purposes. It employs a standard fallback import pattern for compatibility, which is benign. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The models only define data schemas, with no runtime processing of untrusted data or dynamic code execution. The fallback import is a common pattern and not malicious. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of configuration schemas for a plugin system. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The fallback import pattern is a common compatibility measure, not malicious. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0.",
