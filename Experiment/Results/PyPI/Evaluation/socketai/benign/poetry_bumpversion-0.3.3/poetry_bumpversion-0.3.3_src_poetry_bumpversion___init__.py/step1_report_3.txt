{
  "purpose": "This code defines the version of a package or module, typically used to specify the current release version.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the hardcoded string '__version__ = \"0.3.3\"'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output exists in this minimal code; the version string is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and conventional for setting a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single variable assignment setting __version__ to '0.3.3'. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. It appears to be a simple static declaration of the package version, which is common in Python projects. The comment suggests it is part of a Poetry plugin intended to update this version value in the __init__ file, but the provided code itself does not perform any such update or dynamic operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign declaration of a version string with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
