  "purpose": "Declare the version string for a Python package or plugin.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string. It does not perform any file I/O, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The comments suggest it is part of a plugin to update __version__ in __init__ files, but the snippet itself only declares a version variable. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no further action or score adjustment is necessary.",
