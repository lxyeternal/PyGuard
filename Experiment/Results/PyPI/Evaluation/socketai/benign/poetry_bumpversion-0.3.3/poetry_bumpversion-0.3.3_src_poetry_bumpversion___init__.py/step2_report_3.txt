  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, consisting solely of a static assignment of a version string to the variable `__version__`. There are no signs of input handling, dynamic code execution, external communication, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Functionality:**  \n   The code is minimal and straightforward, serving only to declare a version string. The reports correctly identify that it does not perform any file I/O, network operations, or other potentially risky behaviors.  \n   The comment about it being part of a plugin to update `__version__` in `__init__` files is not reflected in the code snippet, but this does not impact the safety assessment of the provided code.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is simple, static, and benign. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any risky behavior.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely declarative with no malicious or suspicious behavior, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unjustified.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   - The reports mention that the code does not perform any dynamic operations or external interactions, which is accurate.  \n   - The code's purpose as a version declaration is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- The code is safe and benign.  \n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a simple, static version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The current scoring is appropriate.",
