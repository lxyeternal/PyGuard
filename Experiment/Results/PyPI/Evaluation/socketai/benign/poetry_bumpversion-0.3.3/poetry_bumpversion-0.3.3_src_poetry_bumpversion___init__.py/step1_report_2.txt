  "purpose": "To define the version string (__version__) for a Poetry plugin, likely used to specify the plugin's version.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string \"0.3.3\" to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "The __version__ variable itself; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static version string to the variable __version__. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, and no network operations. This is typical version declaration code for a Python package or plugin. The code is simple and has no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to declare the plugin's version number. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
