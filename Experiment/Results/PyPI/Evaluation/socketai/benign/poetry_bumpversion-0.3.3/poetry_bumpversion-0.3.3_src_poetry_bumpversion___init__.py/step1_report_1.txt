  "purpose": "Defines the package version with a variable __version__",
  "sources": "The code assigns a string to the variable __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only performs a simple assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string for the package. It does not include input handling, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. The comment suggests it is part of a plugin to update the __version__ in __init__ files, but the code snippet provided does not perform any file I/O or dynamic modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define a version string. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
