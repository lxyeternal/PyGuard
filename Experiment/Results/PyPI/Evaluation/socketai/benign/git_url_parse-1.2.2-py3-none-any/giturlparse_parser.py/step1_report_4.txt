  "purpose": "This code parses various formats of Git repository URLs and returns their components as a structured object.",
  "sources": "The input URL string provided to the Parser class during instantiation.",
  "targets": "The returned Parsed object containing parsed URL components.",
  "flows": "The URL string is processed by multiple regex patterns; upon a match, the captured groups are used to populate the Parsed object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The regex patterns focus solely on parsing URL components. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured approach to parse different URL formats using regular expressions, extracting components such as user, resource, port, owner, and name. It performs straightforward string manipulation and pattern matching. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks are evident. The only potential concern is the permissiveness of regex patterns, but they serve the explicit purpose of URL parsing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a URL parser for Git-related URLs, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle sensitive data, perform network operations, or include any backdoors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
