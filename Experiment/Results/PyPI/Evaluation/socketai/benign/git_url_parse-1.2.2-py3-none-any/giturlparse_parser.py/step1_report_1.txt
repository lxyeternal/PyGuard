{
  "purpose": "The code parses various formats of Git URLs to extract components such as protocol, user, resource, port, owner, and name.",
  "sources": "The URL string provided during the instantiation of the Parser class.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform actions that could leak data or execute untrusted code directly.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> parse() method -> regex matching -> extraction of URL components into a Parsed object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code solely performs pattern matching and parsing. No obfuscated or malicious code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns to match and extract components from various Git URL formats. It creates a Parsed namedtuple to store the parsed components. The parse method applies regexes sequentially to the input URL. If no regex matches, it raises a ParserError. The _get_protocols method extracts protocols from the URL if present. The code is straightforward, focusing on parsing URL components with no dynamic code execution or external data fetching. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions solely as a URL parser for Git URLs. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. The implementation appears standard and secure for its purpose.",
