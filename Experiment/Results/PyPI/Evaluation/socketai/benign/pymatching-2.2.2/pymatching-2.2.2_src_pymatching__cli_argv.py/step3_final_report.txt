  "purpose": "A minimal CLI wrapper that forwards command-line arguments to the 'pymatching' library's CLI function.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (command-line arguments)",
  "sinks": "pymatching.cli() processing of input (external library call)",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> pymatching.cli()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward argument forwarding; no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard sys and an external library, then defines a function that passes user input directly to the library's CLI handler. It does not perform any processing itself. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The security implications depend on the internal implementation of 'pymatching.cli()', which is outside this snippet. The code is benign, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the simplicity and external dependency. The primary concern is trusting 'pymatching' to handle inputs securely; this cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the trustworthiness of the 'pymatching' library. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The current reports' scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
