{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface wrapper that passes command-line arguments to the 'pymatching' library's CLI function.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments from 'sys.argv'.",
  "sinks": "The 'pymatching.cli' function could potentially process untrusted input from the command line, but no specific sinks for malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'sys.argv[1:]' into 'pymatching.cli'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' and 'pymatching', then defines a function that forwards command-line arguments to 'pymatching.cli'. This is a typical pattern for CLI wrappers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment. It relies on the 'pymatching' library's implementation, which is outside the scope of this analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple CLI wrapper that delegates arguments to the 'pymatching' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or security risks in this snippet. It appears benign.",
