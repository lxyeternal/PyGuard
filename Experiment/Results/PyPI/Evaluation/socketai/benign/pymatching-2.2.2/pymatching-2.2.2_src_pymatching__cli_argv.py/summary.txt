  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the trustworthiness of the 'pymatching' library. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The current reports' scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity."
