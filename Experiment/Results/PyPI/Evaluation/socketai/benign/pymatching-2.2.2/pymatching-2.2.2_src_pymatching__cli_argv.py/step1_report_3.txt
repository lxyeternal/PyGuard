{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface wrapper that passes command-line arguments to the 'pymatching' library for processing.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv[1:]",
  "sinks": "Passes data to pymatching.cli() which could process the arguments further",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] -> pymatching.cli()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and pymatching libraries, then defines a function that forwards command-line arguments (excluding the script name) to the pymatching library's CLI method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper for the pymatching library's command-line interface. The script does not process or handle sensitive data directly, nor does it contain any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper that forwards arguments to pymatching. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
