  "flows": "No data flow since there are no sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment directive ('pragma no cover') which is unrelated to malicious intent but indicates code coverage handling.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string to a variable named __version__, which is a common practice for versioning Python packages. The comment 'pragma no cover' suggests this line is excluded from coverage reports, typical in release or version-defining lines. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs present. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are detectable from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with a coverage directive comment. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
