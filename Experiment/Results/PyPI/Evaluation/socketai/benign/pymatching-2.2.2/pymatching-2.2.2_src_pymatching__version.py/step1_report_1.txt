  "flows": "No data flows, as the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a hardcoded version string; no unusual or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to the variable __version__. This is a common practice for Python packages to specify version info. No input sources, sinks, or data flows are present. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident. The code is straightforward and serves as metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard practice in Python modules.",
