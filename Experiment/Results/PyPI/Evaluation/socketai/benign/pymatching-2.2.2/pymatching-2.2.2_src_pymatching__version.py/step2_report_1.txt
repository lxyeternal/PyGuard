  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input sources, data flows, or sinks are present.\n   - No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected.\n   - The code is standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of malicious or security-related concerns.\n   - The mention of the `'pragma no cover'` comment is correctly identified as a coverage directive, not a security issue.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and the code is straightforward, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or risky.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis and are reasonable.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The uniformity across reports indicates consensus.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration. All evidence points to it being safe with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
