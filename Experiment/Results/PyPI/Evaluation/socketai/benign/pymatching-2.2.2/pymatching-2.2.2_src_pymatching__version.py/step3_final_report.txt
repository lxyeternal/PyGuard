  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to __version__ for package identification.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a standard version declaration with a comment for coverage exclusion.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice in Python packages for versioning. No input sources, data flows, or sinks are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The comment 'pragma no cover' is a typical coverage directive, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
