  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious code, or security concerns are detected.\n   - The code is standard practice for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The mention of the `pragma no cover` comment is appropriate; it’s a common coverage directive, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security risk, the risk scores are appropriately set to 0.\n   - No justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The presence of a version string assignment is benign.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All claims are cautious and based on the code’s simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - They align with the analysis that this is a standard version declaration.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign version assignment.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
