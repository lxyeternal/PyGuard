  "purpose": "Defines the version string of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads a string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing beyond assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only version string assignment, no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string '2.2.2' to the __version__ variable, which is common practice in Python packages. No input, no external data sources, and no operations that could lead to security issues or malicious behavior. The comment indicates it is excluded from coverage but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version assignment statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
