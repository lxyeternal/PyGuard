  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script's function: fetch issues, parse changelog entries, categorize, and display.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity. Uses public API data and standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence (0.95), no malware, no security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, consistent description.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, no code injection, no backdoors, only public API usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also accurate, slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still reasonable.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous, accurate.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation, standard API usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, accurate.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to hardcoded owner/repo info, but that’s typical configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (acceptable, given the hardcoded repo info)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (consistent with the presence of hardcoded repo info, which is standard for such scripts)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are 0, with a couple at 0.1 due to hardcoded repo info, which is acceptable and not malicious.\n\n**Overall:** The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the analysis. The logic and reasoning are sound, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — minimal, mainly due to static repo info, which is typical and not risky.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign, standard script for extracting and formatting changelog info from GitHub issues. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The scores reflect the true security posture of the code.",
