  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected; uses public API and standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward data retrieval and formatting without any dynamic code execution, secrets, or malicious patterns. It uses regex to parse issue bodies, categorizes messages, and prints formatted output. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The only minor concern is the hardcoded repository info, which is typical for such scripts and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. It is a standard, transparent script for processing GitHub issues. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to static configuration, not malicious activity.",
