  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source library for quantum error correction graph management and decoding. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input files, which is typical for such scientific libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard low risk for such code."
