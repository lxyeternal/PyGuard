{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for constructing and decoding quantum error correction graphs, supporting multiple formats and models.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays, scipy sparse matrices, external graph libraries (networkx, rustworkx), and models (stim.DetectorErrorModel).",
  "sinks": "No external network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration; data flows are internal within library functions and data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal representations, then to decoding functions, with no external system calls or malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Usage of deprecated features is normal maintenance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, open-source-like implementation for quantum error correction graph management. It interfaces with standard scientific libraries and external models, performing internal data processing without external communication or code execution. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation signals are present. The code's purpose is scientific and computational, with input validation and safe handling of data. The external dependencies are standard and do not introduce security risks. The overall design and code clarity support a high confidence in its legitimacy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source library for quantum error correction graph management and decoding. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input files, which is typical for such scientific libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard low risk for such code.",
