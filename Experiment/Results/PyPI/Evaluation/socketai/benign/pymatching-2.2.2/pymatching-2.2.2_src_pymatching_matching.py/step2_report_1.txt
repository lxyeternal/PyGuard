  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code implements a class for quantum error correction graphs, supporting multiple formats and models.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No explicit network or system sinks; data flows are internal, from input parameters to internal structures, then to decoding.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious code; relies on standard open-source libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals. The confidence is high (0.95), and malware is scored as 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing secure data handling from various input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious network activity; the code handles data securely.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a secure API for graph management, with no malware signals. Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The class supports multiple data formats and external libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or code execution; data flows are within library calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious signals; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports; handles various input formats and external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity or external data exfiltration; data is processed internally.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured library, with no malware signals. Confidence 0.95, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with prior findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages quantum error correction graphs, loading from various sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious network activity or code injection; data flows are contained within the library.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior. Confidence 1, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with previous reports; appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears as a legitimate, open-source-like implementation for quantum error correction graph management.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports consistently indicate no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risks:** The potential security risk is minimal, mainly related to untrusted input data (files, external graphs), but no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores justification:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the analysis. The obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the clear, readable code.\n\n### Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (or similar low value) — standard for a library that processes untrusted data but does not perform network or system modifications.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, open-source-like library for quantum error correction graph management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The risk primarily stems from external data inputs, which are standard and well-handled.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo action needed; the dependency appears safe.",
