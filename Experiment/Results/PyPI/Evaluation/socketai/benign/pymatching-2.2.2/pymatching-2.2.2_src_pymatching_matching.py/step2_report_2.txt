  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, data flows, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is legitimate, with no malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals. It notes the reliance on well-known open-source libraries and standard practices. The confidence level is high (0.95).\n\n- **Critical evaluation:** The code is a scientific library for quantum error correction, involving data loading, graph manipulation, and decoding. No external network communication, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The only potential concern might be if external files or inputs are maliciously crafted, but the code only loads data into internal structures without executing or transmitting it.\n\n- **Malware, obfuscation, risk scores:** Given the analysis, malware score should be **0**, obfuscated **0**, and overall risk **0.2** (standard low risk for such libraries).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data handling, input validation, and standard library usage. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Critical evaluation:** The code interfaces with external files and libraries but does not execute untrusted code or communicate externally. The risk is minimal.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report notes extensive support for multiple formats and external libraries, with no malicious activity. It highlights proper input validation and standard practices.\n\n- **Critical evaluation:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a typical scientific library.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.1**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms the code is legitimate, with no malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It highlights safe handling of data and external dependencies.\n\n- **Critical evaluation:** The code’s purpose is clear, and no suspicious activity is observed.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a standard, well-structured implementation for quantum error correction, with no signs of malicious activity. It emphasizes safe data handling and external library use.\n\n- **Critical evaluation:** No malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, no code injection.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are **0**. The code is purely scientific, with no malicious payloads or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are **0**. The code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns, mainly related to handling untrusted input files, which is standard for such libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, the code appears to be a legitimate, open-source library for quantum error correction graph management and decoding. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (standard low risk for scientific code handling external data)\n\n**Note:** The low risk score accounts for the potential issues if untrusted files are used maliciously, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, transparent, and intended for legitimate scientific and quantum computing purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
