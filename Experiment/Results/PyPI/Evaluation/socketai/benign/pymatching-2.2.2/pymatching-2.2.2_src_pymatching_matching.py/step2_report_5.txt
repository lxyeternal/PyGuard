  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the claims, examining the code, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class's role in constructing and decoding quantum error correction graphs, supporting multiple formats. Matches the code's functionality.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network I/O or external data leaks are indicated; data flows are internal and from trusted sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries (numpy, scipy, networkx, rustworkx, stim, custom C++ backend). No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report rightly concludes the code appears legitimate and safe, with high confidence (0.95). Obfuscated and malware scores are zero.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes input sources (matrices, graphs, files). No issues.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or code execution; data is processed internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is secure, with a high confidence (0.9). Malware is zero.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent with the code. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the class's role and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or external system interactions; data flows are within trusted boundaries.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses external libraries as intended.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes the code is legitimate and safe, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is zero.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct description of the class's functionality and input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity or code injection points; data flows are confined to internal processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code, no backdoors, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. Uses standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code appears safe, with very high confidence (0.95). Malware is zero.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class's purpose and data inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or system modifications; data is processed within the library.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes the code is legitimate and safe, with maximum confidence (1.0). Malware score is zero.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior in any report.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, but justified given the code's purpose and external library dependencies. The code is primarily for scientific computation, with no network activity or external command execution.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard risk level for scientific libraries with external dependencies, no active malicious behavior)\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, open-source library for quantum error correction graph management, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
