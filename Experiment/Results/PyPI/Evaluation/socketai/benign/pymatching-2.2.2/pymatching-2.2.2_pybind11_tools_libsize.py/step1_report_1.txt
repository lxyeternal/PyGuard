{
  "purpose": "A build script to measure and compare the size of a specified shared library (.so) file.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for file path and save file; reads the size of the specified file; reads previous size from a save text file.",
  "sinks": "Reads input from files; writes the current file size to the save file.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> File existence check -> File size measurement -> Optional comparison with previous size -> Write new size to save file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The script only handles file size measurement and comparison, which is typical for a build/debug process.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input arguments, checks for the existence of the specified file, retrieves its size, compares it to a previous size stored in a text file, and updates the save file with the new size. It performs straightforward file I/O and size computation, with no network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The comments clarify its purpose as a debugging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for tracking file size changes during builds. It contains no malicious code or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
