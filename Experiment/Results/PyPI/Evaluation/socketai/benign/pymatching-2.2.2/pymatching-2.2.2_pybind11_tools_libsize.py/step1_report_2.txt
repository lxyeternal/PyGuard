  "purpose": "The script calculates and compares the size of a specified shared library (.so file) to a previously saved size, then updates the saved size.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], os.path.exists(), os.path.getsize(), open() for reading and writing",
  "sinks": "open() for reading and writing files, print() for output",
  "flows": "User provides file paths via command-line arguments -> script checks file existence and size -> reads previous size from save file -> compares sizes -> updates save file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or malicious code behavior, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic, no external network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code processes command-line arguments to determine file paths, checks for file existence, reads file size, compares with previous size stored in a file, and outputs the size difference. It then updates the saved size. All operations are standard file and system interactions without any suspicious or malicious logic. No sensitive data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs simple file size comparison and updates without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility for tracking file size changes. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
