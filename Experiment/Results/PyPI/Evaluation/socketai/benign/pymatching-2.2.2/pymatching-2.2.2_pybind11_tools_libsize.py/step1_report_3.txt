{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to measure the size of a specified shared object (.so) file and compare it to a previously stored size, indicating any changes over time.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments for the filename and save file; checks file existence; reads from the save file; reads the binary size of the target file.",
  "sinks": "The only file operations involve reading from the save file and writing the new size to it; no other sinks like network or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input args -> file existence check -> get file size -> compare with stored size -> output difference -> write new size to save file.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs straightforward file size checks and comparisons, with no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs basic filesystem operations: checking for file existence, obtaining file size, and reading/writing a simple integer value to a file. No user input beyond command-line arguments is used; no network communication or system modifications occur. The code logic is simple and transparent, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads. It serves a specific utility purpose without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build utility script that measures and logs file sizes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
