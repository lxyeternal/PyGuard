{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to measure the size of a specified shared object file (.so) and compare it to a previously saved size, for debugging or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for file paths, checks for file existence, reads a saved size from a text file, and gets the size of a specified file.",
  "sinks": "Writes the current file size to the save.txt file.",
  "flows": "Reads file paths from command-line arguments -> checks file existence -> reads previous size from save.txt -> computes size difference -> outputs info -> overwrites save.txt with new size.",
  "anomalies": "None observed. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. Uses standard file and system operations appropriate for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file size measurement and comparison, utilizing common Python modules os and sys. It includes argument validation, file existence checks, and simple read/write operations. No dynamic execution, no external network communication, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The logic is simple and transparent, serving a utility function without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for debugging purposes that compares file sizes between runs. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use and does not appear to be malicious.",
