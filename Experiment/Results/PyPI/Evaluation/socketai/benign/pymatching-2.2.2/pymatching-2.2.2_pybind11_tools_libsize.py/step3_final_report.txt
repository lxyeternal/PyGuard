  "purpose": "A utility script to measure the size of a specified shared object (.so) file, compare it with a previous size stored in a text file, and update the stored size for future comparisons.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for file paths, checks file existence, reads previous size from save file, and gets current file size using os.path.getsize.",
  "sinks": "File system operations including os.path.exists, open for reading and writing, and os.path.getsize.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> file existence check -> file size measurement -> optional previous size read -> size comparison -> output -> update save file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward file size measurement and comparison. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple file existence checks, size measurement, and comparison with previous data stored locally. It uses standard library functions without obfuscation or malicious behavior. No external network calls or dynamic code execution. The logic is transparent and typical for a build or debugging utility. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The only minor robustness concern is lack of validation of the save file content, but this does not impact security. Overall, the script is benign with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, transparent utility for tracking file size changes. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
