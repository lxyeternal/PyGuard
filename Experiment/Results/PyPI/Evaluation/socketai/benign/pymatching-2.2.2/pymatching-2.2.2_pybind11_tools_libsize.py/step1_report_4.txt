{
  "purpose": "This script calculates the file size of a specified shared object (.so) file and optionally compares it to a previously saved size to detect changes.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for file path and save file, checks file existence, reads previous size from save file if present, and gets file size using os.path.getsize.",
  "sinks": "Writes the new file size to the save file; no other sinks that could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> file existence and size checks -> optional reading of previous size -> comparison -> overwrite save file with current size.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code solely performs size checks and comparisons.",
  "analysis": "The script performs simple file size calculations and comparisons, relying on user-provided filenames. It uses standard library functions and straightforward control flow without obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no external data flows, network activities, or insecure practices. It is a utility script with no malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for tracking file size changes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It simply performs file size comparisons with standard functions, and the code appears safe.",
