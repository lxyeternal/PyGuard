The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input files, which is typical for such scientific libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard low risk for such code."

The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The current reports' scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity."
