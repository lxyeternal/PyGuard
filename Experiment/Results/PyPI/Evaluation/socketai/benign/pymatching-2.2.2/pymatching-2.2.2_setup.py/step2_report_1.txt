  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, code logic, environment variable influence, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a build script for a Python package with CMake extensions, reading environment variables like CMAKE_ARGS, CMAKE_GENERATOR, DEBUG, ARCHFLAGS, and system info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess to invoke 'cmake' commands, influenced by environment variables.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses `exec()` to run code from a local version file, which could be risky if the file is tampered with. Environment variables influence subprocess calls, which could be exploited if manipulated.\n- **Conclusion:** The script appears standard for a build process, with no explicit malicious code. The main concern is the reliance on environment variables and execution of external commands, which is typical but could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously controlled.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected, no malicious payloads)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.3 (moderate, due to environment variable influence)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup script, focusing on build configuration via environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls to build commands, environment variables influence build behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; standard build practices. Environment variables are used to configure build, which is normal.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, minimal security concern assuming trusted environment variables.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, similar to above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls for CMake, environment variables influence commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or backdoors; typical build configuration.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; standard build setup.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, managing build configurations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External subprocess calls, environment variables affecting build commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no backdoors, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, minimal security concern.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build script for a Python package, using environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls, environment variables influencing build.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard build process, no malicious activity.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Use of environment variables:** Standard for build scripts; potential risk if environment is maliciously manipulated, but this is a common aspect of build systems.\n- **Execution of subprocess commands:** Typical in build scripts; no signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Exec() on version file:** Slight concern if the version file is tampered with, but common practice.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The security risk scores are moderate (around 0.2-0.3), reflecting the reliance on environment variables and subprocess calls, which could be exploited if environment is compromised, but this is typical for build scripts.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2-0.3 (standard build process risks)\n\n**Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no signs of supply chain attack or malware.**",
