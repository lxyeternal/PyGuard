  "purpose": "Library initialization and seed setup for the pymatching package",
  "sources": "Import statements from pymatching._cpp_pymatching and pymatching.matching, call to randomize() at import time",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data leakage points",
  "flows": "Import modules -> call to randomize() during import",
  "anomalies": "Immediate call to randomize() at import, which is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from a C++ extension and the main package, then calls randomize() to seed the random number generator using system entropy. There are no external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. The call to randomize() is standard for probabilistic libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting benign initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script for the pymatching library, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
