{
  "purpose": "To generate Morse code signals using a hardware device via the pylibftdi library.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function; the Morse code string and the Morse map dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Device port manipulation (device.port = ...); potentially leaking data through device control; printing 'Bye!'.",
  "flows": "User input (source) flows into output() function, which controls device port; device port commands could potentially be exploited if device firmware is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No network activity, cryptomining, or data exfiltration present. The code interacts solely with hardware.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user input through standard input, converts it to Morse code signals by toggling a device port. It uses standard library functions and the pylibftdi library, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The control flow is straightforward, with no suspicious data handling or malicious actions detected. The only external interaction is with hardware via the BitBangDevice, which is typical for such applications. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Morse code generator that interacts with hardware. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated or harmful code segments. It appears safe for use.",
