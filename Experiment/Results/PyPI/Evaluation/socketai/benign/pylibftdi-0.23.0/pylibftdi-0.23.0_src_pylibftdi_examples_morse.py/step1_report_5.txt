  "purpose": "Generate Morse code signals using a BitBangDevice connected to a physical actuator such as an LED or buzzer.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from stdin via input() function; uses device.port to control hardware.",
  "sinks": "Sets device.port to control hardware output; potentially untrusted data from user input affects device control.",
  "flows": "User input -> device.port control in output() function, through parsing of input string and Morse code map.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no network activity; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script interacts with hardware through pylibftdi's BitBangDevice, controlling hardware based on user input. The code reads input from stdin and uses the device.port attribute to signal Morse code. No external network connections, no code injection points, and no storage of sensitive data are present. The control flow is straightforward, and no suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors is evident. The code's primary function is to convert input text into Morse code signals via hardware control, which is benign. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Morse code generator that interacts with hardware devices. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on current analysis.",
