{
  "purpose": "The code generates Morse code signals via a hardware device controlled through the pylibftdi library, based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from stdin, specifically the input() function, and retrieves Morse code mappings from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "Sets the device.port attribute to 1 or 0 to signal Morse code dots and dashes; interacts with the hardware device via pylibftdi.",
  "flows": "User input is processed and translated into Morse code signals, which are then sent by setting device.port; no untrusted external data flows into system commands or network.",
  "anomalies": "Uses an infinite loop for continuous input; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code does not perform any network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Morse code generator that interfaces with hardware via the pylibftdi library. It reads user input, converts each character into Morse code signals, and controls a hardware device by toggling its port. There are no external data sources other than user input. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code does not send data over the network, modify system files, or perform any suspicious activity. Its structure is simple, and it relies on hardware interaction, which is legitimate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Morse code signaling tool with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply converts input into hardware signals without any suspicious operations or external communication. No security risks or malware concerns are identified.",
