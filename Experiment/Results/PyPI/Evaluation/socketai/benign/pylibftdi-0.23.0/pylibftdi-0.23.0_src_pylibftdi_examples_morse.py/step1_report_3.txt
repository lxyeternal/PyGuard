  "purpose": "To generate Morse code signals using a BitBangDevice connected to a hardware actuator such as an LED or buzzer.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from standard input (`input()`) to determine the string to encode into Morse code.",
  "sinks": "Sets the `port` attribute of the `BitBangDevice` to control hardware output; no external data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "User input -> `output()` function controlling `device.port` based on Morse code symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard Morse code encoding and hardware control logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functions. No network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Morse code generator using the pylibftdi library to control hardware via bit-banging. It reads user input from the terminal, converts characters to Morse signals based on a predefined map, and toggles the `port` of a `BitBangDevice` instance accordingly. It incorporates timing based on WPM to produce accurate signals. There are no external data transmissions, file manipulations, or obfuscated constructs. The code operates solely on user input and hardware control, with no malicious or suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Morse code signal generator intended for hardware control. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident. It performs as documented, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
