{
  "purpose": "The code generates Morse code signals via a bitbang-capable device, such as an LED or buzzer, based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from stdin using input() or isatty() to determine terminal interaction.",
  "sinks": "Controls the device port (device.port = 1 or 0) to produce Morse signals; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input → output function → device.port manipulation for signal generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; normal Morse code logic. No external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily interacts with user input and controls a hardware device for Morse signaling. It imports standard libraries and pylibftdi for hardware control. The Morse code mappings and timing calculations are straightforward. The input reading process is typical, with handling for terminal vs. non-terminal environments. Device control is limited to setting the port high or low, with delays for signal durations. There are no dynamic code executions, backdoors, or network communications. Overall, the code appears to perform its intended function without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Morse code generator for hardware devices, with no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It solely manages hardware signals based on user input, adhering to expected behavior.",
