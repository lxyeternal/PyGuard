{
  "purpose": "The code generates Morse code signals through hardware control using pylibftdi, converting user input into signal patterns on a connected device.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via input() and terminal detection (isatty), retrieves Morse code mappings from a predefined string.",
  "sinks": "Controls device.port to toggle signals based on Morse code symbols, affecting hardware output.",
  "flows": "User input → Morse code mapping → device.port toggling based on symbols → hardware signaling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Morse code generator that interacts solely with hardware via pylibftdi. It reads user input, maps characters to Morse signals, and toggles the device port accordingly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's control over hardware signals is benign, assuming the hardware is trusted. Timing calculations follow standard Morse conventions. No external data leaks or network activity are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Morse code generator controlling hardware signals with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as such.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
