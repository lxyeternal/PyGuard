{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for error handling related to FTDI library operations.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in this code.",
  "targets": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the code only defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that declares two exception classes for error handling, along with module metadata. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded secrets. The code is minimal and typical for such utility modules. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Python wrapper library. It does not contain malware, security issues, or obfuscation.",
