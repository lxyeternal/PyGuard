  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports consistently indicate that the code is straightforward, containing only class definitions for exceptions, with no input/output handling, external communication, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of obfuscation, embedded secrets, or malicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The code appears correct and minimal. The exception classes inherit properly from `Exception`, and the module comments and structure are standard for such utility modules. No logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. Since there's no malicious activity, this seems appropriate.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, no reason exists to assign a higher risk score.\n\n5. **Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a minimal, benign module defining exception classes, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided.",
