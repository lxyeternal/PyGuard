{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for a Python wrapper around libftdi, mainly for error handling related to missing libraries or other FTDI-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines classes and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output actions; no data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The only notable point is the inclusion of license and authorship information.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining two custom exceptions inheriting from Exception and a comment header. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external data interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving only as part of error handling in a larger library. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
