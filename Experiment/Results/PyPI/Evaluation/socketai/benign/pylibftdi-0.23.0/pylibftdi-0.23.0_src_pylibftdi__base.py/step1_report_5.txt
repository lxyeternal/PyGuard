  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the pylibftdi library",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module-level documentation and the definition of two custom exception classes, 'FtdiError' and 'LibraryMissingError'. There are no dynamic features, external data reads, or suspicious constructs. The code's structure is simple and standard for error handling. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated elements are present. The code serves as part of a larger library and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign part of a Python library for FTDI device interaction. It only defines exception classes with no suspicious or malicious features.",
