  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code only defines two custom exception classes (`FtdiError` and `LibraryMissingError`) and contains license and author comments.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions.\n   - No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks:**\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as part of a larger library.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of security concerns.\n\n4. **Any Issues or Logical Flaws?**\n   - No issues identified; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Potential for Re-evaluation:**\n   - Since the code is minimal and benign, the scores seem reasonable.\n   - No reason to increase the malware, obfuscated, or risk scores.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, standard module defining exception classes for error handling.\n- No malicious or security-related issues are present.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
