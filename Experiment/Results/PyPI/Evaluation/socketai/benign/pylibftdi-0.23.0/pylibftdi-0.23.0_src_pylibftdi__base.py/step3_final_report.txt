{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes, 'FtdiError' and 'LibraryMissingError', serving as error handling components within a larger library related to FTDI device management.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external data reads, or environment interactions; only class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external communication points; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code solely establishes exception classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module defining two exception classes inheriting from 'Exception'. It contains no dynamic code, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations. The structure and comments are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Given its benign nature, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence that it is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structural component of a larger library, serving error handling purposes. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are justified and appropriate.",
