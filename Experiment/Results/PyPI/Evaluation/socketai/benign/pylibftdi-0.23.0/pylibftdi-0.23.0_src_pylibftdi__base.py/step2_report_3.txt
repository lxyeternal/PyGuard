  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**\n   - All reports agree that the code only defines two exception classes (`FtdiError` and `LibraryMissingError`) and contains no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, embedded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n   - The code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for such utility modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears correct and idiomatic for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - Since the code is purely definitional, there’s no basis for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n   - The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a simple, safe, and standard part of a larger library, with no security issues.",
