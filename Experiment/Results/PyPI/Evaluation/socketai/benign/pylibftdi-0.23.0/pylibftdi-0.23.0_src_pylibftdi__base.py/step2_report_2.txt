  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, containing only class definitions for exceptions, with no input/output, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving error handling purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident. The code correctly defines custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The class names and inheritance are appropriate for their purpose.\n   - The comments and metadata are consistent and standard.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is justified given the benign nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of security issues.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` scores are 1, reflecting high certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional with no runtime logic, so no vulnerabilities are implied.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is based on the code content.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimates align with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, with no security concerns or malicious features. The existing scores are accurate and justified.",
