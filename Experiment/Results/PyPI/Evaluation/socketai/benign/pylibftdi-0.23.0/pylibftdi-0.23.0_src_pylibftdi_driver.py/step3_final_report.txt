  "purpose": "Python wrapper for libftdi, enabling device enumeration, version info retrieval, and library management for FTDI devices.",
  "sources": "Library loading functions, device enumeration calls, version info retrieval, error handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data exfiltration or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Library loading -> version retrieval and device enumeration -> internal error handling and data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads external hardware libraries dynamically, enumerates connected FTDI devices, retrieves version info, and handles errors appropriately. It uses ctypes correctly, with proper error checking and resource management. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors are present. The dynamic library loading is standard for hardware interaction but could pose minimal risk if libraries are untrusted; however, this is typical in such contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard Python interface for libftdi, performing device enumeration and version management without any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk stems from dynamic library loading, which is common in hardware interface code but does not indicate malicious intent.",
