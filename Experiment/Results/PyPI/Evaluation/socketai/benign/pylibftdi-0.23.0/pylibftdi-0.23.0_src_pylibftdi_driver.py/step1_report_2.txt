  "purpose": "Interface to the libftdi library for FTDI device management, including library loading, version retrieval, and device enumeration.",
  "sources": "Library loading functions (_load_library), version info functions (libusb_version, libftdi_version), device enumeration (list_devices), environment variables are not directly accessed, input parameters for library paths and device IDs.",
  "sinks": "Error message generation (FtdiError), error string retrieval from libraries, device info (manufacturer, description, serial) are returned but no sensitive data is collected or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Library search and load -> version retrieval -> device enumeration -> error handling and string decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code handles library loading and device info retrieval in a standard way. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard library loading, version checking, and device enumeration for FTDI devices using ctypes. It carefully handles potential library absence, errors, and resource cleanup. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Error handling is appropriate, and no sensitive information is leaked or transmitted without explicit intention. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, well-structured library interface for device management with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate implementation for interacting with FTDI devices, focusing on safe library loading, version checking, and device listing.",
