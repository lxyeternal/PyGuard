  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package initialization script for a Python wrapper around libftdi.\n- No external data input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code primarily imports modules, sets constants, and issues a version warning.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n**1. Purpose & Sources:**\n- All reports correctly identify the purpose as a device wrapper library.\n- Sources are mainly module imports and version info; no untrusted input.\n\n**2. Sinks & Flows:**\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No network, file, or output operations involving external data.\n\n**3. Anomalies & Analysis:**\n- No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code.\n- The analysis correctly states the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n**4. Conclusions & Confidence:**\n- All conclude the code is benign, which is accurate.\n- Confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), justified by the simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious activity or code behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk Score (0):** No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.\n\n**Any deviations?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are correct in their assessments and scoring. No changes needed.",
