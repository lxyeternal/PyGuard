{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the pylibftdi Python package, importing modules, defining constants, and issuing a version warning for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version info, and the Python version check warning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static imports and constants only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py for a Python hardware interface library, performing module imports, setting constants, and issuing a version warning if Python < 3.7. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing from untrusted sources. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
