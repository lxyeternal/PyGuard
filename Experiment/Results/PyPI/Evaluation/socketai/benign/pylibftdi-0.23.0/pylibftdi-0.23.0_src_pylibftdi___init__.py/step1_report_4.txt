{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a Python wrapper for the libftdi library, providing classes and constants for interfacing with FTDI devices.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as sys, _base, bitbang, device, driver, serial_device, util, and reads version, author, and license information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data outputs, network communications, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and defines constants; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Python package initialization and metadata file. It imports necessary modules, sets version and author info, defines constants, and issues a warning for older Python versions. There are no functions executing untrusted data, network activity, or system modifications. All code appears to be standard for a package's __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer for a Python wrapper library with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
