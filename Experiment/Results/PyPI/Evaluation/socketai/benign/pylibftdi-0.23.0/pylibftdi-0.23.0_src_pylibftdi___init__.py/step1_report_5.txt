{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python wrapper for the libftdi library, facilitating interaction with FTDI devices via Python.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are read; the code imports modules and sets up constants and class references.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted, nor any network or file operations performed.",
  "flows": "The code primarily establishes module-level variables and imports, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments are present. The version and author info are standard comments. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata, imports, and constants for the pylibftdi package. It conditionally warns on older Python versions. All components are typical for a library wrapper. No dynamic execution, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources are present. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate Python wrapper for libftdi, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely sets up module structures and constants without processing untrusted data or performing harmful actions.",
