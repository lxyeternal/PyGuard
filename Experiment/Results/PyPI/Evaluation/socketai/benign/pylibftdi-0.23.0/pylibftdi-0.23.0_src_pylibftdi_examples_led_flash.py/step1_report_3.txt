  "purpose": "To blink an LED connected via an FTDI interface at a specified rate.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments (sys.argv), importing modules (sys, time, pylibftdi)",
  "sinks": "Modifying the port state of the FTDI device, which controls the LED",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> flash_forever() -> bb.port ^= 1 (toggling LED state)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an FTDI device in bit-bang mode and continuously toggles the first bit (D0) to blink an LED. It optionally takes a flash rate argument from the command line. The code contains a straightforward loop with sleep intervals calculated for the desired flash rate. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious operations are present. The use of pylibftdi appears legitimate, and the purpose matches the code comments.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign utility for blinking an LED via an FTDI device, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
