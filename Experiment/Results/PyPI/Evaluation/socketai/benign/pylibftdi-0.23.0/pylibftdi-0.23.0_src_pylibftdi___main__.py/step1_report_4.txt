  "purpose": "Support for 'python -im pylibftdi' as a REPL with preloaded modules and constants related to pylibftdi.",
  "sources": "Imports from the pylibftdi package, which may include modules, classes, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets up the environment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward initialization module with comments explaining usage.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an entry point for a Python module, importing specific symbols from the pylibftdi package to facilitate an interactive session. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose and usage example, and the import list matches likely public API components. No input handling, network activity, or sensitive data manipulation is present. The code structure is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module intended for interactive use with pylibftdi. It merely sets up the environment with relevant imports. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
