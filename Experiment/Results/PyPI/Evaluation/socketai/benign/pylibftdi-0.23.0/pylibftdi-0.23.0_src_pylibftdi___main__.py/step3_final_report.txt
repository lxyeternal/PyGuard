{
  "purpose": "Support for 'python -im pylibftdi' as an interactive REPL with preloaded modules and constants.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pylibftdi/__init__.py, including constants and classes like ALL_INPUTS, Device, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward import and comment structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal bootstrap module for an interactive environment, importing constants and classes for device management. It contains only comments and import statements, with no data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and serves as a setup utility for an interactive FTDI device management environment. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
