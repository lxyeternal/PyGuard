{
  "purpose": "Provides Azure AD and MSI authentication functionalities, including token caching, refresh, and retrieval, using standard SDK practices.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network requests to Azure endpoints, token parameters, logging outputs.",
  "sinks": "Auth headers in requests, token storage, error and warning logs, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and parameters → token requests → token caching/refresh → session configuration with tokens.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling in token retrieval, default hardcoded client IDs, logging of sensitive info, deprecated class raising NotImplementedError.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure SDK authentication routines, with legitimate network requests to Azure endpoints for token management. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. Exception handling is broad but typical for robustness. Hardcoded client IDs are common in SDKs. No signs of malicious payloads or data exfiltration. Overall, the code aligns with expected SDK practices and is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard Azure SDK authentication code with no malicious intent or sabotage. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with a minimal risk (~0.1-0.2).",
