{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous polling mechanism for Azure resource operations, managing long-running operations (LROs) with error handling and status updates.",
  "sources": "Reads 'retry-after' header from responses, initial request headers, and request URLs from operation objects.",
  "sinks": "Makes HTTP GET requests via an asynchronous client, potentially exposing request headers and URLs.",
  "flows": "Uses the headers from the initial response to re-inject 'x-ms-client-request-id' during status requests; updates operation status based on responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard async/await patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an asynchronous polling class tailored for Azure long-running operations. It handles different status endpoints, manages retries based on 'retry-after' headers, and raises exceptions on failure conditions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. It relies on external modules and classes for exceptions and operation handling, which are not included here, but their usage appears consistent with typical SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate asynchronous polling implementation for Azure SDK operations. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It safely manages operation status polling, including error handling, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
