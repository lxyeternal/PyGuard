  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code appears to be a standard Azure SDK async polling class with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None apparent; the logic aligns with typical SDK patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate given the standard functionality; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is a typical Azure long-running operation poller.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None; the logic and flow are consistent with expected SDK practices.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The low risk reflects the benign nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is a standard polling class.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None; the code follows expected patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 are justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, low security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No, standard implementation.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is a typical async polling class.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with clear, standard code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, indicating low security risk, which is appropriate given the code's purpose.\n\n### My final estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, standard SDK code)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately conservative. The code is a legitimate Azure SDK component for polling long-running operations, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
