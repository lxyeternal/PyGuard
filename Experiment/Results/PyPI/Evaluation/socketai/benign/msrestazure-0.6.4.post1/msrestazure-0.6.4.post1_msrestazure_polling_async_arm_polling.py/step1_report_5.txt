{
  "purpose": "Asynchronous polling class for managing long-running operations in Azure, facilitating status checks and operation handling.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'retry-after' header from responses, reads 'x-ms-client-request-id' from request headers, and requests status URLs via the '_client' object.",
  "sinks": "Uses the '_client.async_send' method to send HTTP requests, potentially exposing request data or headers. Raises exceptions on failure conditions.",
  "flows": "Polling loop retrieves status URLs using headers, makes GET requests to status links, and updates operation status based on responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code uses asynchronous patterns and standard Azure SDK practices without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an async polling mechanism for Azure long-running operations. It reads request headers to include in polling requests, polls status URLs based on operation state, and handles exceptions correctly. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no data leakage or unauthorized actions observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, designed for Azure SDK operation management. No signs of malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as an async poller without malicious features.",
