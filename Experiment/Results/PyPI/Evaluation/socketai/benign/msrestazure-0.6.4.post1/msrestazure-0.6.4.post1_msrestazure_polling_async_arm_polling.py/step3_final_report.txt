  "purpose": "An async polling class for Azure long-running operations, managing status checks, delays, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Headers like 'retry-after' and 'x-ms-client-request-id' from responses; URLs from operation objects; request headers for network calls.",
  "sinks": "Injects 'x-ms-client-request-id' into request headers; performs HTTP GET requests to status URLs; updates operation status based on responses.",
  "flows": "Polling loop that waits based on 'retry-after' header or default timeout, requesting status URLs, and handling success or failure conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Azure SDK async polling logic, with proper header management, URL handling, and error handling. It uses injected headers for request correlation and performs network requests to URLs provided by the operation object. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code aligns with typical SDK practices and does not contain any signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure SDK component for managing long-running operations. It performs standard network requests, handles errors appropriately, and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
