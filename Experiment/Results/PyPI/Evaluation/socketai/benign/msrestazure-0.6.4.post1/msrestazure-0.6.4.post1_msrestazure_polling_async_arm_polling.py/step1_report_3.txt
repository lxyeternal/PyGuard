{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous polling mechanism for Azure resource operations, managing status updates and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'x-ms-client-request-id' header from the initial response request headers; reads response headers such as 'retry-after'; retrieves status URLs from the operation object.",
  "sinks": "Uses the retrieved headers for making GET requests via the client's async_send method; raises exceptions based on operation status; updates operation status based on responses.",
  "flows": "The code flows from polling the operation status via request_status, which uses headers from the initial response, to making GET requests with injected headers, then processing responses to update operation status, repeating until completion or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious URLs; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The code performs standard async HTTP polling operations, with proper exception handling and header management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of an async Azure long-running operation poller. It reads request headers to re-inject 'x-ms-client-request-id' for each status request, which is standard practice. The methods handle different status URL retrievals and errors appropriately. No unusual or malicious behavior is detected. The use of asyncio for concurrency is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Azure SDK implementation for polling operation status asynchronously. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It follows expected patterns for such operations.",
