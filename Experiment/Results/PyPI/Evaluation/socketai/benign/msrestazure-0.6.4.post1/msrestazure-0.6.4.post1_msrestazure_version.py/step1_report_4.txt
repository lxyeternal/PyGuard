  "purpose": "This code defines the version string for a Python package, specifically 'msrestazure'.",
  "sources": "The source is a hardcoded string assignment to 'msrestazure_version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is present; it's a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward comment header followed by a single line assigning a version string to a variable. No input handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The comment is a license statement and documentation, not executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a license header and a static version assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
