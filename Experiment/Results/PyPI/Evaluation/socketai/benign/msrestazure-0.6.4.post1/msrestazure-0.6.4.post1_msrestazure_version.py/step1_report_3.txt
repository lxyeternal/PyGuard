  "purpose": "Define the version of the msrestazure package as a string variable.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '0.6.4.post1' to the variable msrestazure_version.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code simply assigns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header followed by a straightforward variable assignment. The assignment is static and hardcoded, with no dynamic input or external interactions. No functions, network operations, or data processing are present. The license text is standard, and the variable assignment appears to serve as metadata or version info.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only a license header and a simple static variable assignment for versioning purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
