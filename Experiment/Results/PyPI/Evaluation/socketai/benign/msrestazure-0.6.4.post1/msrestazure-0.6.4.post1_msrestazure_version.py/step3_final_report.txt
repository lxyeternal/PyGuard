  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment and a single static variable assignment. There are no functions, input/output, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should all be 0, with high confidence, as the code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata snippet with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate; the malware score should be 0, aligning with the code's nature.",
