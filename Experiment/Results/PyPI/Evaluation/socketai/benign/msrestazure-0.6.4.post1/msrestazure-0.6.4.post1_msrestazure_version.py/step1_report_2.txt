  "purpose": "This code appears to be a metadata or header section of a Python package, mainly providing licensing information and a version variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the license text (comments) and assigns a version string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors; the code is standard license header and variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a simple assignment statement for a version string. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no external communications. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign header and version variable assignment, typical for open-source packages. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
