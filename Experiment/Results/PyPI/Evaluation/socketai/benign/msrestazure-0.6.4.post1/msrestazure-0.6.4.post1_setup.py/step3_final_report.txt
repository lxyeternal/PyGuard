{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools for package configuration, defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long_description, static strings for metadata, and dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static 'setup.py' script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a local README file, specifies dependencies, and uses standard package discovery. No code injection, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. Minor potential issues like missing file validation are not security concerns. Overall, the code poses no security risks and is a standard package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and safe nature.",
