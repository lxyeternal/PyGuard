  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the msrestazure Python package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read 'README.rst' file for long_description, package metadata (name, version, author, etc.), and dependency specifications in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; standard setup script execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a typical setup script with proper metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file used for Python package distribution. It includes package metadata, dependency requirements, and package discovery via find_packages. It reads 'README.rst' for long_description, which is a common practice. The code contains no dynamic execution, external code loading, or untrusted input handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Dependencies are version-restricted but benign. Overall, this is a typical and safe setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
