  "purpose": "Defines module exports and version for a Python package related to Azure configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.azure_configuration and .version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of licensing information, import statements from local modules, and setting the __all__ and __version__ variables. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or perform any network or system actions. The imports are relative and typical for package setup. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply manages package metadata and exports.",
