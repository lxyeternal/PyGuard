  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python module initialization script, mainly importing local modules and setting module metadata.\n- No untrusted input handling, dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation.\n- The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only notable point is a slightly elevated \"securityRisk\" score (0.1) in report 3, but the reasoning states it's minimal and not indicative of actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** process external input, execute dynamic code, or perform any network or system actions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious strings.\n- The code is purely for module setup and metadata.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only point to critique is the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in report 3. Given the code's nature, this should be 0, as there's no actual security risk.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Most assign 0, except report 3 assigns 0.1. Given the benign nature, this should be 0.\n- **Confidence:** All are 1, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- Since the code is purely static and has no malicious or risky behavior, the risk score should be **0** across all reports.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code's purpose is configuration and versioning, typical for package __init__.py files.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n- The reports correctly dismiss any suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (corrected from 0.1 in report 3)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate in their reasoning, but the minor risk score in report 3 should be lowered to 0 for consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature and the thorough reasoning provided in the reports.",
