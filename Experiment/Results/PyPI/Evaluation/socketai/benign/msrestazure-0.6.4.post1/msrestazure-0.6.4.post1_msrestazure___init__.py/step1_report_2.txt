  "purpose": "Module initialization for Azure-related configuration, setting version and exporting AzureConfiguration class.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.azure_configuration and .version), assignment of __version__ from msrestazure_version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import statements bring in local module data, assignment of __version__ from a variable; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard licensing header, straightforward imports, and variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a licensing header, standard import statements, and assigns a version variable from a module. There are no dynamic code execution, external network calls, hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a simple module setup for an Azure SDK component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python module for configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports local modules and sets a version variable, adhering to standard practices.",
