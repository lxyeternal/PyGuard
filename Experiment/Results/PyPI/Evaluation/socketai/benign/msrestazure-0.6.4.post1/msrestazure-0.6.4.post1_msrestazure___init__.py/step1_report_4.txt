{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a simple Python package component that imports configuration and version information for Azure-related functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules '.azure_configuration' and '.version', and the assignment of __version__ to msrestazure_version.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __version__ from msrestazure_version, and __all__ declaration which is benign.",
  "flows": "Import of local modules -> setting __version__ to imported version -> exporting __all__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious strings or network calls, and only standard import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, import statements, and module attribute definitions. No untrusted input handling, no external data sources, no network calls, and no obfuscated or dynamic code. It functions as a simple package component to expose version info and configuration class.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign component of a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It appears to be standard boilerplate code for exposing package version and configuration.",
