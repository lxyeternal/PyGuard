{
  "purpose": "This module appears to set up and expose configuration information and versioning for a software component related to Azure.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .azure_configuration and .version",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static imports and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of licensing comments, import statements from local modules, and setting __all__ and __version__ variables. There are no user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The import statements suggest dependency on other modules within the package, but there are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The licensing header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization snippet with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It simply imports configuration and version information and exposes the 'AzureConfiguration' class for external use.",
