{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and imports specific classes and variables for Azure configuration management.",
  "sources": "Imports 'AzureConfiguration' from a local module, imports 'msrestazure_version' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data flows to external systems, no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Import statements bring in data from local modules, and module metadata assignment sets version info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module initializer with licensing comments, import statements, and module exports. No suspicious or malicious activity is present. It simply exposes the 'AzureConfiguration' class and sets a version variable. All elements are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module entry point with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only imports and exposes configuration elements with no security risks identified.",
