  "purpose": "Module initialization and version setting for the package, including license and metadata information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.azure_configuration and .version).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment of variables.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license headers, import statements, and variable assignments for __all__ and __version__. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as setup and metadata declaration. The absence of any suspicious activity, data leaks, or malicious code indicates a benign nature. The minor security risk scores assigned in some reports (e.g., 0.1) are slightly overcautious; given the code's simplicity, the risk score should be 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate, though the risk score can be confidently set to 0 for consistency.",
