  "purpose": "Manage and poll long-running Azure operations, including response validation, URL extraction, and asynchronous status updates.",
  "sources": "Response headers ('azure-asyncoperation', 'location'), response body content, request URL for polling.",
  "sinks": "Response headers and bodies used to determine operation status; response content deserialized into resource objects.",
  "flows": "Headers and response body data flow from responses to status determination methods; threading initiates polling; URL validation ensures safe URL usage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; threading and network interactions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SDK patterns for managing long-running operations, including URL validation, response deserialization, threading, and exception handling. No malicious indicators such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Response validation and response handling are thorough, and threading is used appropriately for asynchronous polling. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard practices with minimal residual concern. Overall, the code is legitimate, secure, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK component for managing Azure long-running operations, with no signs of malicious or maliciously sabotaging behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action required.",
