{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for managing long-running operations in Azure SDK, including polling and response handling.",
  "sources": "Response headers (_get_header_url), response content (_is_empty, _deserialize, get_outputs, get_status_from_*), response status codes, and input parameters in functions.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization functions, setting resource attributes, response status updates, exception raising on invalid responses, and thread callbacks.",
  "flows": "Header URL extraction (_get_header_url) to response processing (_deserialize, get_outputs), status determination (get_status_from_*), and thread-based polling (_poll, _start).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials. Use of threading for async polling is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. No suspicious network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of polling for Azure long-running operations, with proper error handling and response validation. URL validation is cautious, preventing invalid URLs. The deserialization process and response handling are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. Threading is used appropriately for asynchronous polling without suspicious or hidden actions. There are no signs of backdoors, data leakage, or malicious network activity. The structure and logic are consistent with expected SDK behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation for managing long-running Azure SDK operations. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured for its purpose without any evident security risks.",
