{
  "purpose": "The code implements classes and functions to handle long-running operations, particularly in the context of Azure resource management, including polling status updates and deserializing responses.",
  "sources": "Input sources include responses from REST API calls, specifically response headers ('azure-asyncoperation', 'location') and response bodies containing status or resource information.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are methods that deserialize response bodies, update internal states, and handle responses, but there are no direct sinks involving untrusted data being executed or leaked in an insecure manner.",
  "flows": "The data flows from API responses (sources) through status checks and deserialization processes (sinks) via methods like _deserialize, get_outputs, and various get_status methods, with polling loop control in _poll and threading management in AzureOperationPoller.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. Usage of threading and response parsing appears standard. URL validation is performed to prevent URL injection. No untrusted code execution or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs response validation, status checks, deserialization, and threading to poll long-running Azure operations. URL validation ensures URLs are well-formed before use, and exception handling covers common failure modes. No signs of malicious intent, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code is consistent with typical SDK-like operation management, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing long-running API operations with proper validation and error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The overall security risk is very low, and no malicious intent is detected.",
