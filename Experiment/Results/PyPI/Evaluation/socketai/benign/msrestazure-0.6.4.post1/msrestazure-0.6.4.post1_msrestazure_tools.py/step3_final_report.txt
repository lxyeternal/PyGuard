  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing, validating, constructing, and managing Azure resource IDs, including registration and response handling.",
  "sources": "Resource ID strings, URLs, HTTP response content, request headers",
  "sinks": "Network requests (session.post, session.get), response parsing (json.loads), request header modification",
  "flows": "Input parameters and responses flow into regex parsing, validation, network requests, and response handling",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors; standard SDK utility functions",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure resource ID parsing, validation, and registration workflows. It uses regex for parsing, network requests for resource provider registration, and response parsing. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The automatic registration mechanism is typical for SDKs but could be misused if inputs are malicious, though no evidence suggests malicious intent here. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Network interactions are routine API calls, and no data exfiltration or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate Azure SDK utility code for resource ID management and registration. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The network requests are standard API interactions. The risk level is low, justified by the network activity involved in resource registration. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
