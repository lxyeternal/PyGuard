  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code handles Azure API errors with models and exceptions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard error handling, deserialization, and exception classes. No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The low security risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe error handling, deserialization, and error message formatting. No malicious intent or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report. The analysis is thorough, and the low risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on error response parsing, JSON deserialization, and error message formatting. No signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) possibly due to the mention of deserialization of untrusted JSON data. However, this is standard for error handling, and no malicious activity is indicated. The reasoning remains sound.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a structured error deserialization utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Well-justified. The code is straightforward error handling.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing safe deserialization, error formatting, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent, and the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign malware=0. Given the code's purpose (error handling, deserialization, exception classes) and the absence of any suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic, this is appropriate.\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's clarity and straightforward structure.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.2, which is still quite low. The code is primarily error handling, which inherently carries minimal security risk. The slightly higher score in Report 3 (0.2) due to deserialization of untrusted JSON is reasonable, but overall, the risk remains low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting standard error handling with minimal security implications.\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary. The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall conclusion that the code is a standard, safe error handling module with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
