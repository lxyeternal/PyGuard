{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for handling and deserializing Azure REST API error responses, with some compatibility and error handling utilities.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include HTTP response objects, error message strings, and JSON data from API responses.",
  "sinks": "Data is formatted into error message strings, including JSON dumps and string concatenations, primarily for logging or exception messages.",
  "flows": "Response content is deserialized into error data objects, then formatted into strings for exception messages; no untrusted data flows directly to system commands or network actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; the code handles errors and deserialization securely without evident malicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of error data classes and exception handling for Azure API responses. It performs safe deserialization, string formatting, and error reporting. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or code injections are present. The code uses standard libraries and predictable logic. The exception handling appears appropriate, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. Overall, the code functions as error handling utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for Azure API error processing and does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured, and no malicious or obfuscated code elements are identified.",
