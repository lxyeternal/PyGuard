{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for handling Azure-related errors, deserializing error responses, and managing exceptions for REST API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from response objects, error messages, and JSON payloads within exception handling and deserialization methods.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction, JSON deserialization, string formatting, and exception raising.",
  "flows": "Response data is deserialized into error objects, then formatted into error strings. Error details can include inner errors and additional info, but only within controlled error handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code constructs. Uses standard libraries and proper error handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses solely on error handling and deserialization. It uses safe, standard Python patterns and libraries, with no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activity. It manages exceptions and error messages carefully, with no insecure data handling. No signs of code injection, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The class hierarchy and function logic are typical for error processing modules. Overall, the code appears standard, well-structured error management code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard error handling module for Azure REST API responses. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It responsibly manages errors, deserializes responses, and formats error messages, with no suspicious or malicious signals detected.",
