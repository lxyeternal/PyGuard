  "purpose": "Define error handling classes and exceptions for Azure REST API interactions, including deserialization and error message formatting.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (json, six, requests.RequestException, msrest.exceptions, msrest.serialization), class initializers, error message parsing, response handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage through error message string formatting, deserialization of untrusted JSON data, error message construction.",
  "flows": "Response data from REST API -> deserialization functions -> error message parsing and formatting -> string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Usage of deserialization without validation of input data could potentially lead to exceptions or information leaks if error data is crafted maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes structured error classes for Azure REST API responses, with detailed error message formatting. It employs deserialization of JSON error responses and string construction for error reporting. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The deserialization process could potentially be misused if malicious JSON error payloads are provided, but this is a standard error handling pattern. No unsafe code injection, credential theft, or hidden backdoors identified. The code appears to be part of a larger SDK or library for handling Azure errors securely. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured error handling module with no signs of malicious behavior. Its purpose is to process and format error responses from Azure REST APIs securely. No malware, backdoors, or malicious activity detected.",
