  "purpose": "Error handling and deserialization of Azure API error responses, providing structured error information.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON error payloads from response objects, accessing error attributes and response text.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting, JSON deserialization, string concatenation for error display.",
  "flows": "Response data flows into deserializer, then into error classes, and finally into formatted error strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Standard error handling practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of error classes and deserialization logic for Azure API errors. It reads JSON error responses, deserializes them into structured objects, and formats error messages for display. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The deserialization of untrusted JSON data is a common pattern in error handling but could be exploited if crafted maliciously; however, this does not indicate malicious intent by the code itself. The overall structure is clear, well-structured, and uses standard practices. The low risk score (0.1-0.2) is justified given the context, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe error handling module for Azure SDKs, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The deserialization of untrusted JSON data is typical in error processing but does not constitute malicious behavior. The overall security risk is very low, and the code poses no significant threat.",
