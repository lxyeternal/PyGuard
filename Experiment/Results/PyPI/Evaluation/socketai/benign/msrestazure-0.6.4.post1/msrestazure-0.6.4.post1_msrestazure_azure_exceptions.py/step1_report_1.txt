{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for handling and deserializing Azure API error responses, including custom exceptions and error data models.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from API responses, particularly JSON content and response objects.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that untrusted data flows into which could lead to code execution, data leaks, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses into deserializer functions, then into error data models and exception objects. No malicious source-to-sink flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears standard and well-structured for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements error handling and data deserialization for Azure REST API responses. It uses safe practices like try-except blocks, proper JSON parsing, and clear separation of concerns. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. The only potential concern might be reliance on external response data, but the deserialization process appears standard and safe. No malicious behavior, code injection points, or suspicious activities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for Azure error handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is primarily focused on error data modeling and exception management, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
