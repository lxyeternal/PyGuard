  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard error handling module for Azure API responses. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe and typical for its purpose.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard error handling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Focuses on error deserialization and formatting; no malicious activity or obfuscation. Potential concern about deserialization of untrusted JSON, but this is a common pattern in error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable, considering the slight increase in securityRisk due to deserialization of untrusted data.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just standard error processing.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard error handling and deserialization. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for error handling and deserialization, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any reports.\n- **Risk Score:** The only slight concern is the deserialization of untrusted JSON data, which is a common pattern but could be exploited if crafted maliciously. However, this is a standard practice in error handling and does not inherently pose a significant security risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk:** Given the standard nature and the handling of untrusted data, a risk score of **0.2** is reasonable. It reflects a minimal potential for issues if deserialization is exploited, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2          |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings. The code is a standard, well-structured error handling module with no signs of malicious intent or significant security risks.",
