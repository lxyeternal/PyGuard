{
  "purpose": "The code provides import statements and a version identifier for the bsdiff4 package, as well as a simple test function that runs tests from a submodule.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, the bsdiff4.format module, and the local .test_all module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily imports modules and defines a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are evident. The test function simply calls another module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines a version string, and includes a test function that triggers a test suite from a local module. There are no indications of data processing, user input handling, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a typical module with import statements, version info, and a testing utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
