  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of BSDIFF4 patch utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores are justified, and the absence of obfuscation or malware is confirmed. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain use assuming the 'core' module is trustworthy."
