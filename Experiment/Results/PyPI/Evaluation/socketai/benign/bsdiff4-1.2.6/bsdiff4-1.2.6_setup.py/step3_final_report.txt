  "purpose": "Package setup configuration, including reading metadata and defining build parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for description, reading 'bsdiff4/__init__.py' for version string.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of version string via eval(), which executes the string as code.",
  "flows": "Reading version data from file -> passing string to eval() -> executing code within eval().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on version string read from source file; no other suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks, reading description and version info. The primary security concern is the use of eval() to parse the version string, which could execute malicious code if the source file is compromised. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The eval() usage is a known anti-pattern; replacing it with ast.literal_eval() would enhance security. Scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3) are consistent with the identified risk. No evidence suggests malicious intent or malware; the risk stems from potential exploitation if the source is tampered with.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with a minor security concern due to eval() usage on source data. No malware or obfuscation detected. The scores are appropriate; the main recommendation is to replace eval() with a safer parsing method to mitigate potential code execution risks.",
