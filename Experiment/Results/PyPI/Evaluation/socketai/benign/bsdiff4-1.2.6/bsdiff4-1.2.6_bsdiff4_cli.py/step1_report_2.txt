  "purpose": "The script provides command-line tools for generating and applying BSDIFF4 patches for files, including displaying patch details.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments; reading patch files from disk",
  "sinks": "Reading patch files; displaying information; calling functions that generate or apply patches",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> functions (file_diff, file_patch, read_patch) -> output/display",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious or malicious code present. Use of eval() is generally risky but here it is only evaluating variable names constructed from static strings, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI utility for file patching, using standard libraries and third-party functions from 'bsdiff4'. It reads input files and patch files, displays information, and generates patches. There is no network activity, no obfuscated or dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data that could lead to security issues. The use of eval() is on a controlled string and does not pose a malicious risk, though it is generally discouraged. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for BSDIFF4 patch generation and application. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats identified. The use of eval() is benign in this context but should be avoided for best practices. Overall, the code is safe.",
