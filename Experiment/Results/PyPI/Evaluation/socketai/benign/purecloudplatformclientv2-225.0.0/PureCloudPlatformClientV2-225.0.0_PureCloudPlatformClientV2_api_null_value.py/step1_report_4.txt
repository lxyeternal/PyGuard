{
  "purpose": "Implement a singleton pattern for the ApiNullValue class, which represents a nullable JSON value in models.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, function parameters, and instance checks within the singleton decorator.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The singleton decorator controls instantiation, ensuring only one instance of ApiNullValue is created; data flow is limited to class instantiation and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The singleton pattern is implemented correctly without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton decorator that enforces a single instance of the ApiNullValue class. The class itself is simple, representing a JSON nullable value with methods returning None. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The singleton implementation is standard and safe. No suspicious or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a straightforward singleton pattern for a class representing a JSON nullable value. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and benign.",
