  "purpose": "Define a singleton decorator and a class representing a JSON nullable value for models.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, class attributes, method returns",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily creates a singleton class instance",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton decorator that ensures only one instance of a class exists. The decorator uses an internal dictionary to store instances. The class ApiNullValue is a simple data holder with methods returning None, indicating it represents a nullable JSON value. No user input, external data, or sensitive information is processed. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or system modifications. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and designed to implement a singleton pattern for a placeholder class representing a nullable JSON value. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies.",
