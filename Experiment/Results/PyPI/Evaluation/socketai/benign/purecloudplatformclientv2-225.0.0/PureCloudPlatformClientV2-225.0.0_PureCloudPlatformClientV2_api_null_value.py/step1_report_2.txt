{
  "purpose": "Defines a singleton decorator and a class ApiNullValue used to represent JSON null values in models.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing from external sources; it only defines functions and a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only creates singleton instances and simple methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present. The singleton pattern is straightforward and does not involve dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard singleton pattern via a decorator function. The ApiNullValue class is a simple data structure with methods returning None. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve a utility purpose without any external interactions or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, implementing a singleton pattern and a utility class for representing null JSON values. There are no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
