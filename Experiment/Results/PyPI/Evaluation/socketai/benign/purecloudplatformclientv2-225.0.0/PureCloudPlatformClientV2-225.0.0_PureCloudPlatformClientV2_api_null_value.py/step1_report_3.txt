  "purpose": "Define a singleton decorator and a class representing a nullable JSON value.",
  "sources": "No external data input; the code defines a decorator and a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely defining a pattern and a class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the singleton pattern is straightforward. No obfuscation or suspicious language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton decorator that stores instances in a dictionary and applies it to the ApiNullValue class, which is a simple class representing a JSON null value. The class contains methods to return None for serialization purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. The implementation is standard and adheres to common Python coding practices. No external data input, no network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a singleton pattern and a simple data representation class without any malicious or suspicious features. It appears safe and intended for standard use cases.",
