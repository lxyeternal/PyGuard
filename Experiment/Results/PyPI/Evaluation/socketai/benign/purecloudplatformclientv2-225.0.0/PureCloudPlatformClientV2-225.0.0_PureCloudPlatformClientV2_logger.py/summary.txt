  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, with a slight increase to around 0.3 for security risk to account for silent exception handling that could hide misconfigurations. Overall, it is safe for supply chain use."
