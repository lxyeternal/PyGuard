{
  "purpose": "This code provides a customizable logging utility for an API client, supporting different formats and log levels, and redacting sensitive headers.",
  "sources": "Log input parameters such as method, url, request_body, response_body, headers, and configuration properties like log_file_path and log_format.",
  "sinks": "Log output via file and console handlers; the code does not directly write untrusted data to external systems beyond logging.",
  "flows": "Log methods generate LogStatement objects which format data and send to the logger; data flows from input parameters to formatted log output.",
  "anomalies": "The code only redacts 'Authorization' header; no other sensitive info is explicitly handled. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured logging utility with configurable output and levels. It performs standard logging setup, redacts 'Authorization' headers to prevent leakage, and formats logs in text or JSON. Error handling is minimal but does not introduce security issues. No data leakage, malicious behavior, or supply chain attack vectors are apparent. It appears to be a benign, well-structured utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a logging utility with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It appropriately redacts sensitive headers and provides configurable logging features without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
