{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining package info, imported modules (`sys`, `setuptools`), and the `setup()` function call.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static and does not process data flows or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library. It imports only necessary modules, defines static metadata, dependencies, and calls `setup()`. There are no dynamic behaviors, network activities, or untrusted data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and security risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content. The confidence level is high (1), given the static and straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
