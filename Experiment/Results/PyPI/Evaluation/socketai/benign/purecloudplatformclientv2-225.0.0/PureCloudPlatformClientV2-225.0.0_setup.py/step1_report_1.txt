  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'PureCloudPlatformClientV2' Python package, defining its metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'setuptools', and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; standard setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It imports necessary modules, defines package information such as name, version, author, and dependencies, and calls setup() with these parameters. No external input handling, no network operations, or execution of untrusted code present. All components follow typical conventions for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
