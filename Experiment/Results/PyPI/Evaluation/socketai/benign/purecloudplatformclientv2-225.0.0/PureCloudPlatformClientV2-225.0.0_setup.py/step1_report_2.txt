  "purpose": "Setup script for the PureCloudPlatformClientV2 Python SDK package.",
  "sources": "The script reads package metadata such as name, version, description, author details, URL, keywords, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sinks": "The script does not process untrusted data or execute untrusted code; it only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "The script primarily reads static configuration data and passes it to setuptools for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The email and URL are standard for package metadata. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata and dependencies in a straightforward manner. There are no inputs from external sources at runtime, no dynamic code evaluation, and no suspicious behaviors. All data is static and related to package configuration. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for Python package setup without any anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
