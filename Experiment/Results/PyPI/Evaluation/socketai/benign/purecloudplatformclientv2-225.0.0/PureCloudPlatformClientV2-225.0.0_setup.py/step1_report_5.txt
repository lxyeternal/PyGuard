{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the 'PureCloudPlatformClientV2' Python library.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, setuptools), variables defining package metadata (NAME, VERSION, REQUIRES), and setup() function parameters (name, version, description, author, author_email, url, keywords, install_requires, packages, include_package_data, long_description).",
  "sinks": "The setup() function calls, which package and prepare the code for installation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as this is a static package configuration.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; all variables are hardcoded or predefined, with no user input or dynamic data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns detected. The script is a standard Python package setup script with no obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package. It imports necessary modules, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static parameters. There are no indications of malicious code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The script contains no dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or network activity. All components serve a standard purpose in packaging the library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of the package distribution process.",
