  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logic, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard REST client, no suspicious or malicious patterns, uses reputable libraries, and handles SSL properly.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior; the low risk score reflects typical security considerations for network code.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The score is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on configuration and standard practices. Minor concern about deleting 'Content-Type' header for multipart requests, but this is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just standard request handling.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Highlights that SSL verification can be disabled via configuration, which could be insecure but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Disabling SSL verification is a security concern but not malicious per se.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score is appropriate; no malware detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; standard implementation; configuration-driven; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard REST client with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly lower risk, which is acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; all are straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting typical security considerations for network code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to SSL verification options and handling untrusted data, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented REST client library with no malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. The scores are consistent and justified based on the code's content and analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The existing scores are reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code does not pose a security threat based on the provided analysis.",
