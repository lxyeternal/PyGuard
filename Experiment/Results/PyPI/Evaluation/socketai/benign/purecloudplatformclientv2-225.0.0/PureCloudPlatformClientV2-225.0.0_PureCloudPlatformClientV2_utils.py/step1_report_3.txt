{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for serializing objects into JSON-compatible formats and for marking functions or classes as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Input data to serialize in 'sanitize_for_serialization' (via object attributes, function arguments).",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued in 'deprecated' functions; data returned from 'sanitize_for_serialization'.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'sanitize_for_serialization', potentially transforming complex objects into JSON-compatible dicts; deprecated functions issue warnings when called.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'warnings' module for deprecation notices; no apparent hardcoded credentials or malicious code; no suspicious network or file operations; reliance on external 'ApiNullValue' and object attributes could be misused if objects are maliciously crafted, but this is standard for serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a serialization function that converts objects, including datetime and custom models, into JSON-compatible formats, and a decorator to mark functions/classes as deprecated with warning messages. The serialization logic appears standard, with handling for various types. The deprecation decorator issues warnings but does not execute any malicious activity. No network access, file manipulation, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All functions are for utility and warning purposes, with no signs of malicious intent. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard serialization and deprecation warnings without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical utility module with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
