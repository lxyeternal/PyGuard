  "purpose": "Utility functions for serializing Python objects to JSON-compatible formats and marking functions/classes as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Input data in serialize functions, especially objects passed to sanitize_for_serialization. Deprecated decorator monitors function calls.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in serialize functions, warnings in deprecated decorator, attribute access in sanitize_for_serialization.",
  "flows": "Input objects → sanitize_for_serialization → output data; Deprecated decorator → warnings emitted during function/class calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of warnings for deprecation is standard. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides serialization support and a deprecation warning decorator. The sanitize_for_serialization function carefully converts complex objects into JSON-compatible data, checking for specific types, handling datetime objects, and converting custom model objects via attribute maps. It avoids executing or interpreting untrusted input directly. The deprecated decorator issues warnings when functions or classes are used, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is evident. The code relies on standard libraries and clear control flows, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for serialization and deprecation warnings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
