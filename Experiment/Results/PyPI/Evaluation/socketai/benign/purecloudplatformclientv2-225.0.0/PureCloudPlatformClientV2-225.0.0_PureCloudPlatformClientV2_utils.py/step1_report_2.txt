{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for serializing objects for JSON transmission and marking functions or classes as deprecated with warnings.",
  "sources": "Input data includes objects passed to 'sanitize_for_serialization' and parameters to the 'deprecated' decorator.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points are warnings issued in the 'deprecated' decorator, and data returned by 'sanitize_for_serialization'.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed into 'sanitize_for_serialization' which converts it for JSON serialization, potentially including nested objects. The 'deprecated' decorator issues warnings when decorated functions or classes are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or malicious code patterns observed. The functions perform standard serialization and deprecation warnings without hidden behaviors. Use of 'warnings' and data conversion is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common utility functions. 'sanitize_for_serialization' converts objects to JSON-compatible forms, including handling of dates, lists, dicts, and custom models. The 'deprecated' decorator issues warnings when decorated functions or classes are used. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. No obfuscated code or malicious data flows detected. The warning mechanisms and data serialization are typical for such utilities. Overall, the code appears benign with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard serialization and deprecation warnings with no malicious behavior detected. It is safe and typical for utility modules.",
