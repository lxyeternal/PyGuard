  "purpose": "Utility functions for data serialization, type checking, and deprecation warnings in a Python SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "Input data for serialization in 'sanitize_for_serialization'; decorator argument 'reason' for deprecation warnings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly indicating data leaks, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'sanitize_for_serialization' for JSON serialization; decorator argument flows through 'deprecated' to issue warnings.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides serialization support and a deprecation decorator. The serialization function processes various data types, including dates, lists, dicts, and custom models, converting them into JSON-compatible formats. The 'deprecated' decorator issues warnings for deprecated functions or classes, with flexible use either with or without a reason string. No network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code appears standard, with no obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for API SDKs, providing data serialization and deprecation warnings. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code functions as intended for safe serialization and warning mechanisms.",
