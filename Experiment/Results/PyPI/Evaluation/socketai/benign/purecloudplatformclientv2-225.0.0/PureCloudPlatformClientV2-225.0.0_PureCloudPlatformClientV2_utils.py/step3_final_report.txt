  "purpose": "Utility functions for serializing Python objects into JSON-compatible formats and a decorator for issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'obj' in 'sanitize_for_serialization', and the decorated functions/classes in 'deprecated'.",
  "sinks": "The 'warnings.warn' calls in 'deprecated' which issue warnings; data accessors like 'getattr' on objects with 'swagger_types' and 'attribute_map'.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to 'sanitize_for_serialization' flows through type checks and attribute access; in 'deprecated', function/class invocation triggers warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard handling of data types and warnings; reliance on object attributes 'swagger_types' and 'attribute_map' is typical for generated SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard serialization and deprecation warning utilities. It handles various data types safely, including primitives, lists, dicts, datetime objects, and custom models. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The use of 'warnings.warn' is appropriate, and the handling of custom model attributes is typical for SDKs. The code is clear, well-structured, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code for data serialization and deprecation warnings, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects its benign purpose.",
