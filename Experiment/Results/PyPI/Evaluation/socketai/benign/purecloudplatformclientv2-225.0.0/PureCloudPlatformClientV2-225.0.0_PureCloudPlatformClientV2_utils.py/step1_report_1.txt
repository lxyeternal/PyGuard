  "purpose": "Utility functions for data serialization and deprecation warnings within a Python package, facilitating JSON serialization and marking functions/classes as deprecated.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys, warnings, inspect, functools, six, and internal class ApiNullValue.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in 'sanitize_for_serialization' where data is converted and in 'warnings.warn' where warnings are emitted.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'sanitize_for_serialization' for serialization; deprecated functions trigger warnings via 'warnings.warn'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of 'warnings.warn' for deprecation is standard practice. No suspicious code injections or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'sanitize_for_serialization' safely converts various data types to JSON-compatible formats, including handling dates and models with 'swagger_types'. It also handles different Python versions and avoids dangerous conversions. The 'deprecated' decorator issues deprecation warnings with customizable messages, supporting both with and without reasons. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the code follows typical patterns for such utilities. No external network access, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for serialization and deprecation warnings, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles data serialization and warning emissions without engaging in any harmful actions.",
