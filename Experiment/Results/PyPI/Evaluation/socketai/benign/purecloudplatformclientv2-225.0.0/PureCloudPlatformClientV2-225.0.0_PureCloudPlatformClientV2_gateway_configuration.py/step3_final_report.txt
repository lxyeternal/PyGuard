  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for a network gateway, managing host, protocol, port, login path, API path, username, and password with input normalization and validation.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, property setters for host, protocol, port, path_params_login, path_params_api, username, password",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through setters to internal attributes; no external data flow or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data container with normalization logic",
  "analysis": "The class performs basic input validation and normalization, storing credentials securely within the object. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or external dependencies are evident. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a configuration holder with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration class with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
