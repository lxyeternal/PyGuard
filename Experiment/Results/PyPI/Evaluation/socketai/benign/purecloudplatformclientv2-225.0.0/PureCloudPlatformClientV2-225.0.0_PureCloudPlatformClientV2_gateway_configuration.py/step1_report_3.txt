  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for a gateway with properties for host, protocol, port, login and API paths, username, and password.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters for host, protocol, port, path_params_login, path_params_api, username, password; property setters and getters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no use of untrusted data in insecure operations like system calls, network requests, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to internal variables via setters; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code or obfuscation. Path parameters are sanitized to remove trailing slashes but no validation of content.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward configuration holder with properties and setters that sanitize inputs to avoid trailing slashes. It does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No risky operations, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely stores configuration data with basic input sanitization.",
