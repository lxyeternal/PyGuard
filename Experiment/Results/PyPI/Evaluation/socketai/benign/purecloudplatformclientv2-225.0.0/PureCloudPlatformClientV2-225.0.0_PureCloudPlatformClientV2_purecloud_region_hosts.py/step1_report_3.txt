  "purpose": "Define an enumeration of API host URLs for different regions related to PureCloud services.",
  "sources": "The enum values assigned to each member, which are static string URLs.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines static data and a method to retrieve it.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method assigns an 'apihost' attribute, but in an Enum class, this is unconventional and may cause confusion, as Enum members are typically immutable. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with URL strings representing different API hosts. Each enum member is assigned a URL string. The constructor (__init__) assigns the URL to an instance attribute, which is unusual for Enums since they are generally intended to be constant. The get_api_host() method returns this attribute. No external input processing, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code's structure is simple and primarily static, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration of API endpoint URLs with a simple accessor method. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The unusual use of __init__ in an Enum class is a minor structural anomaly but not malicious.",
