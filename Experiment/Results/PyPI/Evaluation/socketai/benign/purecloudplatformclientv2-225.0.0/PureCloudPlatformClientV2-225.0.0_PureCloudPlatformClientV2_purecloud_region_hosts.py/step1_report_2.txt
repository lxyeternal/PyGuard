{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various PureCloud API host URLs and provide a method to retrieve the host URL.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions, __init__ method, get_api_host method",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; class simply stores and returns predefined URLs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors identified",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with static API endpoint URLs for different regions. The __init__ method assigns a URL to an instance attribute. The get_api_host method returns this URL. All URLs are hardcoded within the enumeration, with no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign enumeration of API hosts with a simple accessor method. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated behavior.",
