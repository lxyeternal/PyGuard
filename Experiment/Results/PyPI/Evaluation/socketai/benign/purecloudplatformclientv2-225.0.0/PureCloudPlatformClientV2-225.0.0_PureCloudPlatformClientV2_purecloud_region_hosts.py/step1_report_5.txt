  "purpose": "Define an enumeration of API host URLs for different regions, with a method to retrieve the URL associated with each enum member.",
  "sources": "Enum member definitions with URLs, the __init__ method assigning the URL to an instance variable, and get_api_host method returning this variable.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; method get_api_host returns stored data without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Enum members initialized with URLs, stored in self.apihost, retrieved via get_api_host(). No data flow from untrusted sources or to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. Enum class used appropriately. __init__ method assigns URL to self.apihost, and get_api_host returns it. No hardcoded credentials beyond the expected URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class for API host URLs per region. Each enum member holds a URL string. The __init__ method assigns this URL to an instance variable. The get_api_host method retrieves the stored URL. No dynamic code execution, no input/output operations involving external untrusted data, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward enum definition for regional API endpoints with a simple accessor method. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It serves a utility purpose without security concerns.",
