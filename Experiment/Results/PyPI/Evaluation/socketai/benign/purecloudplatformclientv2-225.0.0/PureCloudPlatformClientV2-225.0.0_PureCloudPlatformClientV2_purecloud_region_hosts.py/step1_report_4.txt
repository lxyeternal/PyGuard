  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various regional API host URLs related to PureCloud services, providing a method to retrieve the API host URL.",
  "sources": "Enum members containing URL strings assigned as class variables; __init__ method assigning apihost; get_api_host method returning the URL.",
  "sinks": "get_api_host method returns the URL; no apparent untrusted data sinks or external data flow points.",
  "flows": "Enum member values assigned to apihost in __init__, then returned via get_api_host; no external input or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method stores the URL in an instance attribute but is not used to modify or fetch external input; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; class design is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum with URL strings as members, representing different regional API endpoints. Each enum member's value is a URL string, which is stored in the apihost attribute during initialization. The get_api_host method simply returns this stored URL. There is no use of untrusted input, no network activity, no code execution, nor any suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple configuration container without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign enumeration of API host URLs for different regions. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data flows that could compromise security. It appears to be a straightforward, safe configuration class.",
