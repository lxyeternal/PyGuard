  "purpose": "Defines a set of regional API endpoint URLs as enum members with an accessor method.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL strings within enum members.",
  "sinks": "The get_api_host() method returns the stored URL; no untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "Enum member initialization assigns URL to 'apihost'; get_api_host() retrieves this value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __init__ in an Enum class to assign an instance attribute, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static enumeration of API URLs with an unusual but harmless use of __init__ in an Enum. No dynamic code, external inputs, secrets, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The minor structural anomaly does not introduce security risks. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score is effectively 0, with a very slight overestimation in one report at 0.1, which is acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration class with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The use of __init__ in an Enum is unconventional but harmless. All assessments are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
