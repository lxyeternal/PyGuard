{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different regional API host URLs related to PureCloud service, providing methods to retrieve the API host URL.",
  "sources": "Enumeration values assigned as strings representing URLs; class initialization with URL strings.",
  "sinks": "The get_api_host method returns the stored URL, which could be used elsewhere in network requests or logging.",
  "flows": "Enumeration values are assigned at class definition; get_api_host returns these URLs for potential network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials beyond the URL strings. The use of Enum and __init__ is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines an Enum with URL strings and includes an __init__ method to store the URL in an instance variable. The get_api_host method returns this URL. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. No dynamic code execution, no external data input handling, and no secret or credential management is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward enumeration of API endpoints with a simple accessor method. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation for managing API URLs.",
