  "purpose": "Configuration management for an SDK, including dynamic reloading, credential handling, SSL settings, and proxy configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from files (INI/JSON), environment variables, class attributes, and filesystem events.",
  "sinks": "Stores sensitive data such as API keys, tokens, credentials in memory; no data exfiltration or network leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from files or environment to class attributes; live reload monitors file changes to update configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution; standard threading and filesystem watcher usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK configuration handler with live reload capabilities. It uses common libraries and patterns, manages sensitive data securely in memory, and employs threading for filesystem monitoring. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The live reload feature, while potentially risky if misused, is implemented securely here. No network activity or data exfiltration points are evident. The configuration loading and updating mechanisms are straightforward and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard configuration management tasks without malicious intent or security risks. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
