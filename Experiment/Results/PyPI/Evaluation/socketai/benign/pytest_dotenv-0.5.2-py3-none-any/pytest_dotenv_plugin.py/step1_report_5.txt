  "purpose": "The code configures pytest to load environment variables from specified dotenv files during test setup.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via dotenv.load_dotenv and dotenv.find_dotenv based on configuration options.",
  "markets": "No direct untrusted input sources; environment variable file paths are specified via command-line options or configuration, not user input.",
  "flows": "The environment variable file paths are read from configuration options and then passed to load_dotenv, which loads environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Usage of dotenv is standard for environment management in tests.",
  "analysis": "The script defines pytest hooks to load environment variables from files specified in configuration. It supports multiple env files and can override existing environment variables. The command-line option '--envfile' allows overriding environment variables with a specific file. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or secret exfiltration. It only manages environment variables for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration for managing environment variables during pytest runs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for testing environment setup.",
