  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and assessing the validity of their conclusions, the scores assigned, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward pytest configuration script that loads environment variables from dotenv files during test setup.\n- It uses standard libraries (`dotenv`, `pytest`) and common practices.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The environment variables are loaded from files specified via configuration or command-line options, with no indication of untrusted input sources or malicious intent.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; it correctly loads environment variables from specified dotenv files during pytest startup.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are evident; the code is a standard setup for environment management.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the code's nature, these are low but acknowledge minimal inherent risk in environment configuration.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The **security risk scores** are slightly higher than zero, perhaps reflecting a general caution about environment variable management. However, since no actual malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present, these scores could reasonably be 0 or very close to it.\n- The **malware scores** are correctly assigned as 0, given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The **confidence scores** are high (0.9 to 1.0), justified by the code's simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; no changes needed.\n- The scores align with the analysis; no overestimation or underestimation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, due to environment variable handling, but not problematic)\n\nThe code is a standard, safe pytest environment setup with no supply chain or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code poses no security threat, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
