{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to load environment variables from specified .env files during the pytest testing setup process.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable configurations from .env files specified via command-line options or ini settings.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only loads environment variables into the process environment.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read from files and injected into the environment, but no untrusted data flows are evident beyond standard dotenv loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code primarily interacts with environment variable files and pytest configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dotenv and pytest modules, defines pytest configuration options to specify environment files, and loads these environment variables at different points during pytest startup using load_dotenv. The use of dotenv is standard for managing environment configurations in test environments. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for managing environment variables during pytest runs, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
