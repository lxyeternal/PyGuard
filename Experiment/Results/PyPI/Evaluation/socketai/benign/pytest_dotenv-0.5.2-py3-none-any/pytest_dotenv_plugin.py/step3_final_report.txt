  "purpose": "Manage environment variables during pytest startup by loading specified dotenv files, allowing configuration via ini and command-line options.",
  "sources": "Reading dotenv files specified in configuration and command-line options, using find_dotenv and load_dotenv functions.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables loaded into process environment; no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Source: dotenv files specified via ini or command-line -> load_dotenv -> environment variables in process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard practices, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest plugin setup that loads environment variables from dotenv files during test initialization. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The environment variables are loaded into the process environment, which is typical for test setups. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pytest environment configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
