  "purpose": "The code configures pytest to load environment variables from specified .env files during testing setup.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable configurations from dotenv files and command-line options.",
  "sinks": "Loads environment variables into the process environment, potentially overriding existing variables based on configuration.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument or ini configuration -> load_dotenv() -> environment variables in the process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of dotenv is standard for environment management.",
  "analysis": "The script defines pytest hooks to load environment variables from specified dotenv files, respecting override options. It retrieves configuration from ini files and command-line arguments, then loads environment variables accordingly. There is no indication of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful actions. The use of dotenv files is common for managing environment settings in testing, and no suspicious patterns or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for managing environment variables during testing with pytest. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
