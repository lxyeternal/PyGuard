{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable loading for pytest test sessions using dotenv, allowing configuration via ini files and command-line options.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration options from pytest ini and command-line arguments; loads environment variables from specified dotenv files.",
  "targets": "Loads environment variables into the process environment, which could affect subsequent code execution or tests.",
  "flows": "Configuration options -> dotenv files -> environment variables",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of dotenv is standard for environment management; no suspicious dynamic code or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages environment variables for pytest using dotenv and configuration options. It reads environment configuration files and applies them, with options to override existing variables. No data is sent over the network, no secrets are embedded, and there are no malicious code patterns. The functions used are standard and safe. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for environment setup, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment configuration setup for pytest, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely loads environment variables for testing purposes, following typical practices.",
