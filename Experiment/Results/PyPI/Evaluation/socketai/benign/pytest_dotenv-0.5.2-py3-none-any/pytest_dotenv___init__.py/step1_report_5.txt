  "purpose": "Defines package metadata including version and author information.",
  "sources": "Reads static string literals for version and author.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple string assignments to module-level variables indicating package version and author. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external interactions. The code appears to be standard package metadata, typical for Python modules or packages. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only basic metadata declarations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
