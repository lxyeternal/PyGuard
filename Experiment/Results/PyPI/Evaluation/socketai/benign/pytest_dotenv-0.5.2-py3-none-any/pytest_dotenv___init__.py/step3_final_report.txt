{
  "purpose": "This code snippet defines package metadata with static string assignments to __version__ and __author__, serving as package identification information.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignments within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static variable assignments with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of two string assignments for package metadata. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code, or external interactions. The code is clear, simple, and standard for Python package metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
