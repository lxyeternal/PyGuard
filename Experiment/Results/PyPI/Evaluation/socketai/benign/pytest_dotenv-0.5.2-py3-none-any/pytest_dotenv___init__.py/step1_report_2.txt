  "purpose": "Define package version and author information.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data fetching).",
  "sinks": "None (no data leaks or system modifications).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow pathways).",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only metadata variables are set with no suspicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns string values to two metadata variables: __version__ and __author__. These are standard in Python packages for metadata purposes. No input handling, data processing, or system interactions are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are detected. The code appears to be straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to declare package version and author metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
