  "purpose": "Defines package version and author information for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward metadata declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two variable assignments setting package metadata (__version__ and __author__). There are no inputs, outputs, or any operational code. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard part of a Python package's metadata, commonly found in __init__.py or version files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify package version and author information. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
