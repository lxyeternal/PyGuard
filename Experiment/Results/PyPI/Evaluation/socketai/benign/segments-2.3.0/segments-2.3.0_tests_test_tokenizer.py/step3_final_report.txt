{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of pytest-based unit tests for the 'segments' package, focusing on Tokenizer, Profile, and Rules functionalities, primarily for linguistic processing validation.",
  "sources": "Test data files read via fixtures and in-memory strings within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications; data flows are confined within test functions and fixtures.",
  "flows": "Input data from test files or in-memory strings flows through tokenization, normalization, and profile application functions without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions verifying linguistic processing behaviors, normalization, profile matching, and error handling. It relies on standard libraries and known dependencies, with no external system calls or network activity. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and designed for validation purposes. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test suite for linguistic processing modules, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0–0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
