  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python package installation using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports 'setup' from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; setup() is called without arguments.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply invokes setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic, standard minimal setup script that relies on external configuration files. It does not process input, perform dynamic code execution, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
