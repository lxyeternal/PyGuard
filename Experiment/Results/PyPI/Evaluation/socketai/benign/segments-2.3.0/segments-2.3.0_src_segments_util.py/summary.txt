  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Unicode normalization and grapheme segmentation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the slight elevation of the security risk score in one report should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security concerns."
