  "purpose": "Define Unicode normalization and grapheme pattern for string processing.",
  "sources": "Untrusted data sources are not explicitly indicated in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for Unicode handling and regular expressions, defines a replacement marker, and sets up Unicode normalization and grapheme pattern compilation. All operations are standard string processing setups with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No external data input, output, or untrusted data handling is present, and the code appears to be a simple utility setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard Unicode and regex setup for string processing, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, benign application.",
