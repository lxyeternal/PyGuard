{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up utilities for Unicode normalization and grapheme pattern matching, likely for text processing or validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads Unicode normalization functions and compiles a regex pattern for grapheme clusters.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks; the code only sets up normalization and pattern matching tools.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident, as the code only defines constants and compiles a pattern without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The use of regex for grapheme matching and Unicode normalization is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for text processing and defines a replacement marker. It creates a partial function for Unicode normalization to NFD form and compiles a regex pattern for Unicode grapheme clusters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Unicode handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for text normalization and pattern matching. No malicious intent, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are present.",
