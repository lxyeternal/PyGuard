{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up utilities for Unicode normalization and grapheme pattern matching, likely for processing or manipulating text data.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; the code defines functions and constants for text processing, which may be used later to process external input.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not currently process untrusted input or produce output. It only defines tools.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; the code establishes normalization and pattern matching functions but does not execute any data processing flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated parts, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The use of regex and unicode normalization is standard for text processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for text normalization and pattern matching, defines a Unicode replacement marker, and creates partial functions and compiled regex patterns for Unicode grapheme segmentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of 'regex' (an enhanced regex library) is legitimate for advanced Unicode processing, not inherently suspicious. No external data is read or written at this stage. Overall, this is a preparatory setup for text processing with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, setting up text normalization and pattern matching utilities without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, safe text processing pipeline.",
