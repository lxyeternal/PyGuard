  "purpose": "Define Unicode normalization and grapheme cluster processing tools, possibly for text processing or sanitization.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are explicitly present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to set up Unicode normalization and grapheme pattern compilation without any suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules for Unicode processing, defines a replacement marker, and compiles a regex pattern to match grapheme clusters using the regex library. The use of functools.partial to create a normalization function 'nfd' is standard. The regex pattern uses '\\X', which matches extended grapheme clusters, a common technique in text processing. No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup for Unicode normalization and grapheme processing without any malicious intent. It does not contain any data leaks, suspicious network activity, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
