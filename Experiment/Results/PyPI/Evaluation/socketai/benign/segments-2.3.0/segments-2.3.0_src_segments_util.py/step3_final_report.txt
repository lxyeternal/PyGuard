{
  "purpose": "Setup for Unicode normalization and grapheme segmentation using standard and third-party modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools, unicodedata, and regex modules; definition of REPLACEMENT_MARKER; partial function for NFD normalization; compilation of grapheme pattern.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not read untrusted input or write output, nor does it perform network operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward Unicode processing setup with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines a replacement marker, sets up a Unicode normalization function, and compiles a regex pattern for grapheme clusters. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The use of regex for Unicode grapheme segmentation is standard in text processing. No external data handling or network activity is present. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, as the code performs a utility function without vulnerabilities. Minor variations in confidence scores are acceptable; overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Unicode normalization and grapheme segmentation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the slight elevation of the security risk score in one report should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security concerns.",
