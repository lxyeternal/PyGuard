{
  "purpose": "The code defines an Orthography Profile class for handling phonetic/orthographic data, including reading from files, creating profiles from text, and serializing to string.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are from method parameters (specs, text, filenames), file reading (pathlib.Path), and external modules (TableGroup.from_file, .fromvalue, etc.).",
  "sinks": "File writing occurs via the __str__ method; data serialization uses TableGroup.write, which writes to a buffer and decodes to utf8.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters and files are processed into internal data structures, with serialization converting internal structures into output strings. No external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks beyond standard file handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or uncommon language features; no suspicious data manipulation; the code does not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs and manages orthography profiles, reading from files or text and serializing profiles for output. It uses standard libraries and external modules for data handling. No code injection, network activity, or system modifications are detected. The only potential concern is file handling, but it is standard and does not involve unsafe operations. The code performs normalization and checks for duplicate graphemes, which are typical for this context. Overall, there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of an orthography profile management system. It handles data input/output and normalization securely, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
