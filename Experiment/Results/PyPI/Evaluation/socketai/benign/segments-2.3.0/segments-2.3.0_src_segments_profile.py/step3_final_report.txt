{
  "purpose": "Manage orthography profiles including reading from files, normalization, serialization, and iteration over grapheme specifications.",
  "sources": "File input via 'from_file' method, text input via 'from_text' and 'from_textfile' methods, and internal data structures during initialization and iteration.",
  "sinks": "Data serialization to string in '__str__', file reading, and Unicode normalization; no untrusted data sinks or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data (files, text) -> normalization and validation -> internal data structures -> serialization or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, eval/exec, or obfuscation detected. Warnings suppressed during file handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data management tasks for orthography profiles, including reading, normalization, and serialization. It uses external libraries appropriately and contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The validation steps, such as duplicate detection and Unicode normalization, are straightforward. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, well-structured nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for managing orthography profiles with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
