  "purpose": "Define public API exports for a package, specifying version and imported modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'segments.tokenizer', 'segments.profile', and 'segments.util'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and variables from internal modules, sets a version string, and defines the public API exports. There is no data processing, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious constructs. All imports are from seemingly internal, organized modules. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The code appears to be a standard module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manages module exports and versioning, with no suspicious or harmful actions.",
