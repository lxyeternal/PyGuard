{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and constants from modules within the 'segments' package and defines the package version and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'segments.tokenizer', 'segments.profile', and 'segments.util' modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only performs imports and defines metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code does not process any input or generate output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors are present. All imports are standard and clearly labeled with noqa comments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports, defines a version string, and specifies __all__ for exports. There are no functions, data processing, or network interactions. The imports are from local modules, and the use of noqa comments indicates they are intentionally included. No evidence of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely as a module setup with standard import statements and metadata. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or malicious intent.",
