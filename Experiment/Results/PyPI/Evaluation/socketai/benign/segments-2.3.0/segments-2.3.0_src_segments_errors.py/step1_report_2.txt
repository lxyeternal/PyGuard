{
  "purpose": "Provides default implementations for error handlers related to grapheme processing, such as logging invalid input, replacing, or ignoring it.",
  "sources": "The functions receive a character 'c' as input, which is likely an untrusted or processed input related to grapheme handling.",
  "takes": "None of the functions directly take untrusted external input like environment variables, user input, or network data; they operate on the parameter 'c'.",
  "sinks": "Logging via 'log.debug' could potentially expose internal data if 'c' contains sensitive information, but this is standard debugging practice and does not pose a significant security risk.",
  "flows": "Input 'c' is processed within each function, either logged, replaced, or ignored; no complex flow or data propagation to external systems occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; REPLACEMENT_MARKER is imported from a utility module, likely a constant. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple error handling functions that log the character and either raise an exception, replace it with a marker, or ignore it. All operations are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of logging could be a minor concern if 'c' contains sensitive data, but this is typical for debugging. No external data sources or sinks are involved that could lead to data leaks or exploitation. The import of REPLACEMENT_MARKER suggests external utility code, but without evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard error handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply logs and manages erroneous grapheme input in a benign manner.",
