  "purpose": "Error handling functions for grapheme processing: strict validation, replacement, and ignoring invalid graphemes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'c' in each function; logging calls; import of REPLACEMENT_MARKER from segments.util.",
  "sinks": "Logging of 'c' which could potentially expose sensitive data if 'c' contains secrets.",
  "flows": "Input 'c' is logged; 'strict' raises an exception; 'replace' returns REPLACEMENT_MARKER; 'ignore' returns empty string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; functions perform standard error handling; import of REPLACEMENT_MARKER is benign assuming it's a constant.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple error handling functions that log the input 'c' and either raise an exception or return constants. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. Logging potentially sensitive data is a common debugging practice but could be a minor concern if 'c' contains secrets. The import of REPLACEMENT_MARKER appears benign. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no external system interactions or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard error handling for text processing, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The minimal security concern relates to logging potentially sensitive data, which is typical in debugging contexts. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
