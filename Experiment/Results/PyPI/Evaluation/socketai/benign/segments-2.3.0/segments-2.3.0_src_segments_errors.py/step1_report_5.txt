  "purpose": "Provides default error handling functions for grapheme processing, including strict, replace, and ignore strategies.",
  "sources": "Logging functions and the REPLACEMENT_MARKER import, which may be influenced by external modules.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs that could potentially reveal sensitive data if misused, and return statements that could affect processing flow.",
  "flows": "Input 'c' is passed to each function; functions log the input and then either raise an exception, return a marker, or return an empty string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of logging for debugging; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors; no external network or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple error handling functions. 'strict' logs and raises an exception; 'replace' logs and returns a replacement marker; 'ignore' logs and returns an empty string. The import from 'segments.util' is benign assuming REPLACEMENT_MARKER is a normal constant. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is evident. The functions are straightforward, with no malicious data flows or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard error handling routines for grapheme processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly logs and manages errors as expected.",
