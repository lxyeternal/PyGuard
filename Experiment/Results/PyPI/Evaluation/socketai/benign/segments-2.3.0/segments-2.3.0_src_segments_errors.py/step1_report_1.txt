{
  "purpose": "Provides default error handling functions for processing graphemes, including strict, replace, and ignore behaviors.",
  "sources": "The functions receive a single parameter 'c', which represents a grapheme or character, likely from an external or user input source.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to external systems, files, or network; they primarily log messages and return values or raise exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input 'c' is logged in all functions. The 'replace' function returns a constant marker, and 'ignore' returns an empty string; 'strict' raises an exception upon invalid input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The logging statements are straightforward; the code performs simple error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions for handling errors during processing: 'strict' raises an exception with a log message, 'replace' logs and returns a marker, and 'ignore' logs and returns an empty string. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and no suspicious operations are present. The functions are simple and serve as error handlers, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard error handling functions for grapheme processing, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is straightforward and lacks suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.",
