{
  "purpose": "Provides default error handling implementations for grapheme processing, including strict, replace, and ignore behaviors.",
  "sources": "The functions receive input parameter 'c', which represents a grapheme (character or sequence).",
  "sinks": "The functions log debug messages; 'replace' returns a replacement marker; 'ignore' returns an empty string; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'c' is logged and then either raises an exception ('strict') or returns a value ('replace' or 'ignore'). There are no external data flows to untrusted sources or sinks beyond logging and return values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious actions. Use of logging is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple error handling functions for grapheme processing, with standard logging. The 'strict' function raises an error on invalid input, while 'replace' and 'ignore' functions handle invalid input gracefully. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The functions do not interact with external systems beyond logging, and there are no signs of data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, functional, and contains no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. It serves as utility functions for error handling in text processing. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
