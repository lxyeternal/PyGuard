{
  "purpose": "Provide default implementations for error handlers related to grapheme processing",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'c' in each function (presumably untrusted data), logging statements",
  "sinks": "Logging output, return statements potentially providing controlled output",
  "flows": "Input 'c' is logged, then either raises an exception, returns a constant, or returns an empty string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; functions perform straightforward operations",
  "analysis": "The code defines three error handling functions for grapheme processing: 'strict' raises an error, 'replace' returns a replacement marker, and 'ignore' returns an empty string. Logging is used for debugging purposes. There are no external data sources, network activity, or obfuscated code. The functions handle untrusted input but do not perform any harmful actions. They are simple, safe utility functions typical in text processing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard error handling implementations for text processing with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is well-structured, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
