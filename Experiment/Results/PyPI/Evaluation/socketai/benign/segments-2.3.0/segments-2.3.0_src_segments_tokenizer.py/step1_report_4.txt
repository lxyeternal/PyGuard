{
  "purpose": "Unicode character and grapheme cluster tokenization, with support for orthography-specific profiles and transformation rules.",
  "sources": "Reads orthography profiles from files, loads rules from files, processes input strings, and reads profile data via Profile class methods.",
  "sinks": "Applies transformation rules, processes text data, and manipulates Unicode strings; no explicit sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Reads profile data and rules from files -> processes input string -> applies rules and transformations -> outputs tokenized or transformed string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; usage of standard Unicode and regex modules; no obfuscated code features; rules and profile loading are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs Unicode text segmentation, profile-based transformations, and rule applications. It loads orthography profiles and transformation rules from files, which is typical for linguistic processing tools. The apply methods and transformations are based on regex rules and profile mappings. The combine_modifiers function manages Unicode modifier characters in a way consistent with Unicode standards, without any hidden or malicious logic. There are no network operations, system commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All functions are related to text processing and do not exhibit malicious intent. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected. Overall, the code is well-structured for linguistic tokenization and transformation, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a Unicode and orthography profile-based tokenizer with transformation capabilities. It performs expected linguistic processing functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The implementation is straightforward, and no malicious signals are detected.",
