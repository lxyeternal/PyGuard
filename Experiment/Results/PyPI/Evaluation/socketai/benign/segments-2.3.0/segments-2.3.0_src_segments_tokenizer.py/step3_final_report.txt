  "purpose": "Unicode character and grapheme tokenization with orthography profile support and rule-based transformations.",
  "sources": "Input strings, profile files, rules files, profile attributes, external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Local string processing, regex transformations, Unicode normalization, profile lookups.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Unicode normalization -> profile parsing -> profile-based transformations -> regex rule applications -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Unicode handling and combine_modifiers are standard and explicit.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Unicode segmentation, profile-based grapheme transformations, and rule applications using standard libraries and predictable Unicode handling. No external network or system modifications are present. The combine_modifiers method explicitly manages Unicode combining characters, aligning with Unicode standards. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. External dependencies are common in linguistic processing tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Unicode tokenization and transformation utility, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.1) are accurate and justified.",
