{
  "purpose": "The code provides Unicode and grapheme cluster tokenization with orthography profile-based transformations, including applying custom rules, combining modifiers, and transforming graphemes into other representations.",
  "sources": "Input strings from function parameters, orthography profile files, rules files, and reading profile data.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data leaks or system modifications are performed. External data is read-only, and no network or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through tokenization, transformation, and rule application functions, with no indications of data being sent elsewhere or executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code relies on well-established libraries (unicodedata, regex, csvw). The only dynamic element is reading rules and profiles from files, which is standard. No obfuscated code patterns or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Unicode and grapheme cluster tokenization, profile-based transformations, and rule applications using safe Python libraries. It reads profiles and rules from files with proper normalization and applies regular expressions for transformations. The combine_modifiers method handles combining Unicode modifier letters and stress marks, which is consistent with Unicode standards. No suspicious network activity, system modifications, or malicious data handling routines are present. The code's design aligns with standard linguistic tokenization tasks, and no malicious behaviors or sabotage indicators are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Unicode tokenizer with profile-based transformations, intended for linguistic or orthographic processing. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident based on the provided code. It operates solely on input data and configuration files, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
