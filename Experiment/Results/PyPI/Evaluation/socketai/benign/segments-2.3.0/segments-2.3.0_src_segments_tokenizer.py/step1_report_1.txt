{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Unicode character and grapheme tokenization tool tailored for orthographies, allowing transformation and application of orthography-specific rules and profiles.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the __call__ method, orthography profile files, rules files, and profile attributes such as 'fname'.",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly. The code does not send data over networks, execute system commands, or access environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed via normalization, grapheme segmentation, and optional profile-based transformations, followed by rule applications. Data flows from input through tokenization, profile transformation, and rule application to produce a tokenized output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code uses external libraries like regex and csvw, but these are standard and not suspicious. The combine_modifiers function handles Unicode combining characters but does so straightforwardly. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured for Unicode-based tokenization, applying standard Unicode segmentation rules and optional orthography profiles. It reads profile and rules files safely, performs normalization, and applies regex-based transformations. The combine_modifiers method handles Unicode combining marks explicitly and in a predictable manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The methods perform well-defined transformations and tokenizations based on Unicode standards and user-defined profiles. The use of external libraries like regex and csvw is appropriate and not suspicious. Overall, the implementation appears focused on linguistic tokenization without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a Unicode tokenization utility with optional profile-based transformations, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes data locally with standard libraries and explicit methods, and no suspicious activities are evident.",
