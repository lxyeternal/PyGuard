{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Unicode-based tokenizer with support for orthography profiles and custom rules, primarily for linguistic processing and text segmentation.",
  "sources": "Input strings from function parameters; profile files via Profile class; rules files read through CSVW reader; orthography profile files (possibly from filesystem).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly direct untrusted data to external systems; no network connections, file writing, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are normalized and split into words; profile data influences transformation; rules are applied to output; combine_modifiers processes graphemes; ultimately, tokenized output is produced with optional normalization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. The code does handle errors via passed error functions, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides Unicode grapheme and character tokenization, applying orthography-specific transformations via profiles and rules. It reads files for rules and profiles, but these are typical for linguistic tools. The combine_modifiers method processes Unicode combining characters and modifiers safely, with no signs of malicious manipulation. No network operations, file writing, or code injection points are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with clear separation of functions and no suspicious dynamic code execution. No embedded or hidden code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are detected. The use of external libraries (regex, csvw, pathlib, unicodedata) is standard. The error handling functions are passed in, which is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a linguistic tokenizer with profile-based customization and rule application. It does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as intended for text processing with no malicious payloads or backdoors.",
