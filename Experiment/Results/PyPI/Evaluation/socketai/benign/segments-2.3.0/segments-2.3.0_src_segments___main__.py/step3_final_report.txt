{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for tokenizing text or creating orthography profiles using external 'segments' library components.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command-line arguments or stdin; profile path is validated if provided.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to stdout; no untrusted data is written to files or network.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from args or stdin into external 'Tokenizer' or 'Profile' functions, then results are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Basic validation on profile path exists.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with standard input validation and error handling. It relies on external modules for core processing, which are not included but appear benign. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The data flow is simple, with input read, processed via trusted external functions, and output printed. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
