{
  "purpose": "Provide URL validation, filtering, and extraction functions for web crawling and parsing.",
  "sources": "Input URL strings, page content, URL validation functions, and external configuration (e.g., blacklist).",
  "sinks": "URL normalization, filtering, redirection testing, and extraction of links that may be used downstream for crawling.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and page content are validated, normalized, and filtered through multiple functions, with potential URL modifications (e.g., redirection testing, normalization). Extracted links are checked for trustworthiness before being returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hidden code detected. Use of standard libraries and filtering functions appears benign. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns. The only notable aspect is the detailed filtering process, which is expected for such modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL validation, filtering, and extraction with multiple checks against URL structure, domain, extension, language, and navigation relevance. It uses standard libraries and custom filters, with no evident malicious behavior. Functions such as check_url and extract_links are designed to sanitize and validate URLs before use. There are no indications of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's logic is consistent with a secure URL filtering and extraction utility. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. Use of logging is for debugging and informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL filtering and extraction utility with comprehensive validation and filtering mechanisms. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Its security risk score is low, and malware score is negligible. Overall, it appears safe for use in secure applications.",
