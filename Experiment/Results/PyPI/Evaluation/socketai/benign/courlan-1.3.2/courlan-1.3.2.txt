      "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL testing utility with a security concern regarding disabled SSL verification. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The primary risk is the insecure SSL setting, which should be addressed in production environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a risk score around 0.3 reflects the security concern without implying malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate URL management utility with the main security concern being the use of pickle for data serialization, which could be exploited if the pickle files are tampered with. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) due to pickle. Proper handling of pickle files can mitigate this risk."

The external dependencies could pose a risk if malicious, but within this snippet, no such behavior is evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and conservative. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal."
