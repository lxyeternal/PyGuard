  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured URL processing CLI with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external dependencies could pose a risk if malicious, but within this snippet, no such behavior is evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and conservative. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal."
