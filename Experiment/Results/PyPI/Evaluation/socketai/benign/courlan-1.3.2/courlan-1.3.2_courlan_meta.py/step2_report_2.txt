  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code imports `clear_cache` from `urllib.parse` and `cache_clear` from `.filters`.\n   - The function `clear_caches()` calls both to clear internal caches.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Assessment**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward cache clearing utility.\n   - No untrusted input processing, no external data flow, no hardcoded secrets.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n   - The operations are standard for performance optimization and cache management.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. There is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, justified because the code does not process untrusted data or perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:\n   - No issues found; all scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No need to adjust scores; they correctly reflect the benign nature of this utility.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely utility for cache clearing, the risk remains minimal.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment, emphasizing the benign and standard behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard cache management utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk indications. The reports' scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the evidence provided.",
