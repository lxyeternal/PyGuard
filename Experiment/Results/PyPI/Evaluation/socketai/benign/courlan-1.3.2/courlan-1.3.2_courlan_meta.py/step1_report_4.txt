  "purpose": "Define and provide meta-functions to clear caches used across the module to improve performance.",
  "sources": "urllib.parse.clear_cache(), langcodes_score.cache_clear()",
  "targets": "None (no untrusted data processing or external data outputs)",
  "flows": "N/A (function calls to clear caches, no data flow involving untrusted input or output)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of cache clearing functions is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a cache-clearing function from urllib.parse and another cache clear method from a local module. The clear_caches function invokes these cache clearing routines to reset in-memory caches, likely to manage memory or refresh data. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows involving untrusted sources. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. This appears to be utility code for cache management.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely clears caches to maintain performance and memory efficiency. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks in this snippet.",
