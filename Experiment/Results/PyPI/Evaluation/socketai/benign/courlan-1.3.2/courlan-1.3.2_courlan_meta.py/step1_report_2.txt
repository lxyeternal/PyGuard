  "purpose": "Meta-functions to clear caches related to URL parsing and language code scoring",
  "sources": "urllib.parse.clear_cache (imported function), langcodes_score.cache_clear()",
  "sinks": "Cache clearing functions which may influence cache state but do not process untrusted data directly",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; functions are invoked to clear caches",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and only calls cache clear methods without any dynamic execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a cache clearing function from urllib.parse and a cache clear method from a local module. The clear_caches() function invokes these to reset internal caches, which is a benign operation intended to free memory. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injection. The code does not process or handle user input or untrusted data; it solely manages cache states. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to clear caches for URL parsing and language scoring. It poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
