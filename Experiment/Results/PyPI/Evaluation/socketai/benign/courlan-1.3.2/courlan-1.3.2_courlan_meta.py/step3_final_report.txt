  "purpose": "Utility function to clear internal caches for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (`urllib.parse`) and local module (`.filters.langcodes_score`).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; function only calls cache clearing methods.",
  "flows": "Function `clear_caches()` calls cache clear methods directly; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward cache clearing utility with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cache clearing functions from standard and local modules, then defines a function that clears these caches. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with appropriate scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0. The code's purpose is performance optimization via cache management, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe cache management utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
