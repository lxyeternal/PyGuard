  "purpose": "Define meta-functions to clear caches used within the module, specifically for urllib and langcodes_score.",
  "sources": "Calls to urllib.parse.clear_cache and langcodes_score.cache_clear()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the functions simply clear caches",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; functions are invoked to clear internal caches",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward cache clearing with no obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code imports a cache clear function from urllib.parse and a cache clear method from a local module. It defines a function that, when called, clears caches related to URL parsing and language scoring. There is no use of user input, network communication, or untrusted data. The code performs standard cache management without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, purpose-driven cache clearing functions with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
