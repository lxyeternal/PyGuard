  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code imports `clear_cache` from `urllib.parse` and `cache_clear` from `.filters`.\n   - The function `clear_caches()` calls both to clear internal caches.\n   - The code is straightforward, intended for cache management to optimize performance.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the functions are standard cache clearing utilities.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code only clears caches without handling untrusted data, network operations, or secrets, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - All reports agree on a minimal or zero security risk, which is accurate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested.\n   - The code does not perform any external communications, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign cache management.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and transparency of the code, I agree with the provided assessments. The code is a utility function for cache clearing, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a performance optimization purpose.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The overall security posture of this snippet is minimal risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' findings.",
