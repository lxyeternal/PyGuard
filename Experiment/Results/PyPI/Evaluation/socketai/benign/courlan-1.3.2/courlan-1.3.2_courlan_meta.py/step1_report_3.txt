  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to clear caches used within the module.",
  "sources": "Importing urllib.parse.clear_cache and langcodes_score.cache_clear()",
  "sinks": "Calling cache_clear() functions (cache invalidation), no data leaks or external outputs",
  "flows": "Function clear_caches() calls cache clearing methods, no external data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function to clear internal caches for performance optimization. It imports cache clearing functions from standard library and a local module. The function invokes these to reset caches, which is typical for cache management. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data leaks, and no suspicious external communications or code modifications. No obfuscation, no malicious code, and the operations are straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module with no malicious intent. It simply resets caches to manage memory and performance, with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior.",
