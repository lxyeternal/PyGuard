  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, importing cache clearing functions from standard libraries and local modules, and calling them within a utility function.\n   - There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n   - The code is purely for cache management, with no processing of untrusted input or external data.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, simple, and intended for performance optimization.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk, malware, obfuscated, and overall risk scores of 0 or 1 with confidence 1.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Since the code is straightforward cache clearing, a risk score of 0.0 or 0.1 is justified; a score of 1 might overstate the risk, but given the context, it is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, does not perform network operations, nor contains any obfuscated or malicious code.\n   - Therefore, the overall security risk should be very low, ideally close to 0.\n   - Malware score should be 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not seem to make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate minimal risk and no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, just for conservative estimation)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a simple utility for cache management, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable but could be slightly lowered to reflect the minimal risk.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
