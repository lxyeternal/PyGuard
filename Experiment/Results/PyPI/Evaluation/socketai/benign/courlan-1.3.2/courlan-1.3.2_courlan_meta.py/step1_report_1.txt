  "purpose": "Define meta-functions to clear caches used throughout the module, primarily for performance management.",
  "sources": "Import of 'clear_cache' function from 'urllib.parse' and 'cache_clear' method from 'langcodes_score' in '.filters'.",
  "sinks": "The 'clear_cache' functions could potentially be used to clear sensitive cache data, but in this context, they are standard cache clearing operations.",
  "flows": "The function 'clear_caches' calls 'urllib_clear_cache' and 'langcodes_score.cache_clear()', both of which clear internal caches, potentially affecting stored data in caches.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard cache clearing methods without any obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function to clear caches from two sources: the urllib library and a custom 'langcodes_score' cache. Both are standard cache management functions. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious data flows. The code appears straightforward, intended for performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cache reset utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted input or perform any suspicious operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
