{
  "purpose": "The script configures the build process for a Python package named 'courlan', optionally compiling modules with mypyc for performance improvements.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) to determine whether to include mypyc compilation. No external data inputs are read beyond command-line args.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any network, file, or environment modifications.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are checked to decide on compilation method; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The only dynamic behavior is conditional module compilation based on CLI args.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly manages the setup process, conditionally including mypyc compilation modules based on command-line input. It imports standard libraries, performs a straightforward argument check, and configures the build accordingly. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident. The code's purpose is to facilitate package compilation with optional optimization, with no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages compilation options based on user input and does not interact with external data or systems maliciously.",
