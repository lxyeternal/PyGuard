{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'courlan' Python package, enabling optional compilation with mypyc based on a command-line argument.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; imports standard libraries and optional mypyc modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sources; no data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--use-mypyc' influences whether mypyc modules are built; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward build configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple setup script that conditionally compiles modules with mypyc. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation or malicious code. The logic is standard, and the purpose is benign. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports correctly identify its safe nature. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
