  "purpose": "Functions to perform HTTP requests and handle URL redirection testing",
  "sources": "Input URL provided as function argument in redirection_test",
  "sinks": "HTTP request made through urllib3 PoolManager; geturl() and request() calls",
  "flows": "Input URL -> request('HEAD', url) -> geturl() if response status acceptable",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious response handling observed; commented out headers code is benign",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL validation by sending a HEAD request using urllib3. It disables SSL certificate verification, which is a security concern but not malicious. It catches and logs exceptions, then raises an error if the URL cannot be reached. The logic is straightforward with no suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden functionalities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL redirect tester, with no indications of malicious behavior or security threats. The only notable issue is SSL verification disabled, which is a security concern but not malicious.",
