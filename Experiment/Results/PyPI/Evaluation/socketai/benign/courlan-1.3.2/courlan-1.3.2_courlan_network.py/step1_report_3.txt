  "purpose": "Provides functions for testing URL redirects and handling HTTP requests over the web.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL parameter in redirection_test function.",
  "sinks": "None of the sinks process untrusted data directly for malicious effects; the request function only performs HTTP HEAD requests.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> HTTP_POOL.request() -> returns final URL if status is acceptable.",
  "anomalies": "Uses cert_reqs='CERT_NONE' which disables SSL certificate verification, potentially insecure. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present. The code appears straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an HTTP connection pool with retry strategy and no SSL verification, which could be insecure but not malicious per se. The function performs a HEAD request to test URL redirection, logs exceptions, and raises an error if the URL is unreachable or does not return acceptable status codes. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The only potential concern is the disabling of SSL verification, which could be exploited if used maliciously, but in this context, it appears as a configuration choice rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL redirection testing utility with no malicious intent detected. The only security concern is the disabling of SSL verification, which may pose security risks if misused. Overall, no malicious behavior or malware is identified.",
