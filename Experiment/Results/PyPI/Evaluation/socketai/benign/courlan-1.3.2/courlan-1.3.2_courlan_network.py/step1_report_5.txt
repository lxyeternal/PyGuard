  "purpose": "Provides functions to perform HTTP requests and handle redirects, mainly for testing final URL after redirection.",
  "sources": "Input URL parameter in redirection_test function.",
  "sinks": "HTTP_POOL.request method which makes network requests, potentially exposing URL or other data if not properly validated.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> HTTP_POOL.request('HEAD', url) -> returns final URL if successful.",
  "anomalies": "The code disables SSL certificate verification (cert_reqs='CERT_NONE'), which is insecure and can be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks. The commented-out code hints at possible user-agent customization, but it is inactive. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses urllib3 to perform HTTP HEAD requests with a retry strategy and disables SSL verification, which is insecure but not malicious per se. It handles redirects and logs errors. The only concerning part is the disabling of SSL verification, which can be exploited but does not appear to be intentionally malicious or malicious code. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The function is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions beyond insecure SSL handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a utility for testing URL redirects. It disables SSL verification, which poses security risks but does not constitute malicious behavior. No malware or malicious intent is detected.",
