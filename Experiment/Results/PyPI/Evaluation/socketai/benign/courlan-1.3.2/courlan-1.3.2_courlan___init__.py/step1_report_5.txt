{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to provide a module for cleaning, filtering, normalizing, and sampling URLs, along with utility functions for URL processing.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code imports functions and defines metadata. Potential data sources include external URL data processed by imported functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident in this code snippet; it primarily defines imports, metadata, and exports. Potential sinks could occur within the imported modules when processing URLs.",
  "flows": "Data flow likely involves external URL data passing through imported functions such as clean_url, check_url, or extract_links, which are not detailed here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are apparent. The code is standard for a URL processing library, with normal import/export patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata, imports functions from relative modules, and exports them via __all__. It does not perform any data processing or contain executable code beyond imports and exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The structure is typical for a Python package index file, designed for modular URL processing functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard URL processing module without any malicious intent or security risks. It mainly sets up the package's structure and exposes functions for URL handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
