{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for cleaning, filtering, normalizing, and sampling URLs as part of a URL processing toolkit.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.clean, .core, .filters, .sampling, .urlstore, .urlutils), which likely contain core functionalities and data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code mainly imports functions and defines an API interface without executing or processing data directly.",
  "flows": "No data processing flows are visible within this snippet; the code only defines imports and exports, acting as an interface.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions and classes related to URL processing and declares an API surface via __all__. It is a module definition with no active data handling or logic execution. No sources or sinks are directly invoked; no code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observable. The code appears to be a standard package interface file, with no signs of tampering or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module interface for URL processing functions, with no malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks detected. It is likely safe and serves as a library component.",
