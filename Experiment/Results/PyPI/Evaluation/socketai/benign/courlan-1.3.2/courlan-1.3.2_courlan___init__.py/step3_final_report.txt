{
  "purpose": "Module providing URL utility functions such as cleaning, normalizing, filtering, and sampling URLs, organized via imports and exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.clean, .core, .filters, .sampling, .urlstore, .urlutils). No runtime data input handling within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; functions imported may process untrusted URL data, but this code only exposes them without executing logic.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code is a static interface, not executing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for a package initializer.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py or module index that imports various URL processing functions and exposes them via __all__. It contains only metadata and import/export statements, with no runtime logic, data handling, or dynamic code. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code indicates a benign purpose. The consistent low malware and security risk scores across reports are appropriate, reflecting the code's nature as a simple interface. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present within this snippet. The overall security posture based on this code is very low risk, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard Python package interface for URL utilities. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
