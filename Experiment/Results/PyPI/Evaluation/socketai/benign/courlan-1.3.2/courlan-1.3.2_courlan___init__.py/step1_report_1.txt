{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for URL cleaning, filtering, normalization, sampling, and related operations, primarily to support web crawling or data processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Imported functions and modules such as clean_url, normalize_url, scrub_url, check_url, extract_links, and other utilities, which may process input URLs or data within their implementations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this module; the code primarily imports and exposes functions. Potential sinks could occur within these imported functions if they handle untrusted input, but that is outside this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Unclear from this snippet alone; data flows depend on how imported functions process URLs. No direct data flow or untrusted data handling is visible in this module itself.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present in this code snippet. The module mainly imports and re-exports functions without any dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module interface with metadata and import statements. It does not contain any processing logic, input handling, or security-sensitive operations within this snippet. It appears standard and clean, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. Security risks or malware possibilities cannot be assessed from this high-level interface alone, but the absence of dynamic code or suspicious constructs is noted.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module interface for URL processing functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or compromised based on this snippet alone.",
