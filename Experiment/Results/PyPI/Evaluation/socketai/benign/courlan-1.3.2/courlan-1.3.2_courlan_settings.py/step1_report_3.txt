  "sources": "Static data structures: BLACKLIST, ALLOWED_PARAMS, LANG_PARAMS, TARGET_LANGS",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing, user input, or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares static configurations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains only static data assignments with no execution logic",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares constant sets and dictionaries for configuration purposes. There are no functions, input/output handling, or dynamic data processing. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or network communication is present. The code appears to serve as configuration data for filtering and localization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module defining blacklists and parameter sets without any malicious intent or security risks.",
