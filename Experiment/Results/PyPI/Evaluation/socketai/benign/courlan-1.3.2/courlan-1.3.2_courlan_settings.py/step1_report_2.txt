  "purpose": "Define general settings including a blacklist of domain-related keywords, allowed URL parameters, and language options for package execution configuration.",
  "sources": "Constants defined in the script: BLACKLIST, ALLOWED_PARAMS, LANG_PARAMS, TARGET_LANGS.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not perform data output or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing; the script only defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscated elements observed. The code is straightforward configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up static configurations for a package, including a large set of blacklisted domain keywords, allowed URL parameters, and language mappings. No user input, network access, or dynamic code execution is present. The blacklist appears to filter certain domains, possibly for access control or filtering purposes, without any signs of malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious logic is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet defining static data structures. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is safe and serves as a reference or configuration setup.",
