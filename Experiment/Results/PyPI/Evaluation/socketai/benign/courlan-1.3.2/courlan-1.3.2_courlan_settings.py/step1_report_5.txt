{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for package execution, including blacklists, allowed parameters, language parameters, and target languages.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, such as BLACKLIST, ALLOWED_PARAMS, LANG_PARAMS, and TARGET_LANGS; no external data sources or input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows or output operations involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely declares static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The lists are extensive but static.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes static configuration data, including a blacklist of domain or keyword identifiers, permitted URL parameters, language-related parameters, and target language mappings. There are no functions, no input handling, or dynamic code execution. The content appears to serve as configuration parameters for filtering or validation routines in a larger application. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, setting static configuration constants with no execution logic, input/output handling, or potential for malicious behavior. It appears benign and intended for filtering or validation purposes within a larger system.",
