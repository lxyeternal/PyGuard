  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration data—sets and dictionaries for blacklists, allowed parameters, and language options.\n- No functions, input handling, dynamic code execution, or external data processing are present.\n- The code appears to serve as a configuration module for filtering or validation within a larger application.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware indicators are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All describe the code as defining static constants for configuration, which is accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identified as no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistently conclude that the code is benign, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **malware:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious indicators.\n- **securityRisk:** 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **risk:** 0, matching the overall benign evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The code is purely static configuration data with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores of zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified.\n\n- **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on the static and benign nature of the code, which is correct.\n\n- **Potential issues?**  \n  No. The blacklists, allowed parameters, and language mappings are typical configuration data.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Metric            | Score |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| **Malware**      | **0**  |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0**  |\n| **Risk**         | **0**  |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward static configuration setup with no dynamic or malicious components. The existing reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across the board.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No changes needed.",
