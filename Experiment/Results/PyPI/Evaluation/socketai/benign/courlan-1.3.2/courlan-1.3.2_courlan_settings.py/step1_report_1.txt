  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for package execution, including blacklists, allowed parameters, language settings, and target languages.",
  "sources": "Static data structures (sets and dictionaries) initialized with string literals",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; all data structures are statically defined",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code sets up constants for blacklisting domains and parameters, as well as language options. All data is hardcoded as static collections. No functions, user inputs, or external data sources are present. There are no code execution, data processing, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
