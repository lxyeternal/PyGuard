  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining blacklists, allowed parameters, and language mappings for URL or domain filtering.",
  "sources": "Predefined sets and dictionaries within the code; no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "None; static data used as constants, no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code contains only static data structures with no unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static configuration with no functions, dynamic processing, or external interactions. It includes blacklists, allowed parameters, and language mappings, all of which are typical for filtering or validation purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reports, all correctly scoring malware, obfuscation, and security risk as zero with high confidence. The data does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns, and the scores are consistent with the static, safe content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the current scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
