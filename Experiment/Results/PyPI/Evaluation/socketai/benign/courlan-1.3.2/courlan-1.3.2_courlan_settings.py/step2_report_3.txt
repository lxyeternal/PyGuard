  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static configuration data defining blacklists, allowed parameters, and language mappings.\n- No dynamic code, user input processing, or external data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, with no code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Presence of issues in the code:**\n- **Confirmed:** The code contains only static data structures with no processing logic, so there are no issues related to code correctness, security, or malicious behavior.\n- **Note:** The reports are accurate in stating that the code is benign configuration data.\n\n#### **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify the static nature and benign intent.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n- The assessments of no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are justified.\n\n#### **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting certainty.\n\n#### **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports correctly identify the code as purely static configuration with no malicious or risky behavior, raising the risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n\n#### **Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No obfuscated code or hidden payloads are present.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n#### **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they consistently state that the code is benign.\n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n#### **Score consistency:**\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty based on static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a static configuration snippet, safe and benign. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is purely configuration data with no malicious or security concerns. The provided scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent.",
