  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for package execution, including blacklists, allowed parameters, language parameters, and target languages.",
  "sources": "Constant sets and dictionaries such as BLACKLIST, ALLOWED_PARAMS, LANG_PARAMS, and TARGET_LANGS.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines static data; there are no data flows involving external inputs or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. All data structures are static and used for configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up several configuration constants: a BLACKLIST set containing domain and URL-related terms, a set of ALLOWED_PARAMS for URL query parameters, a set LANG_PARAMS for language-related query parameters, and TARGET_LANGS mapping language codes to various representations. All elements are static, hardcoded, and used for filtering or validation. There are no functions, data processing, or external data handling that could introduce security risks. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration module for a larger application, with no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
