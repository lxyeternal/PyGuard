  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe URL utility library with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.2) are consistent with its functionality. It can be considered benign, with potential misuse depending on how untrusted URLs are handled externally, but the code itself does not facilitate malicious activity."
