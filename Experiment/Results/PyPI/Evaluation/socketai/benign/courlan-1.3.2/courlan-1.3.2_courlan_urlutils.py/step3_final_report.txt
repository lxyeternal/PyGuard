{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for URL parsing, domain extraction, URL normalization, filtering, and comparison, primarily to facilitate URL handling tasks.",
  "sources": "Input URLs are read from function parameters, often untrusted, and processed via regex, urlsplit, or get_tld functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that lead to data leaks, network communication, or execution; it processes URLs internally without external effects.",
  "flows": "URLs are parsed (source), domain info is extracted or normalized, and then used for filtering or comparison (sink), with no external data exfiltration or malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; regex patterns are standard, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard URL parsing and domain extraction techniques using regex and the tld library. It handles untrusted input safely, with fallback mechanisms for robustness. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The functions are utility-focused, with clear, readable logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are identified. The regex patterns are typical for URL schemes and domain matching, and the use of get_tld provides reliable domain info. The functions that compare or filter URLs do so based on standard domain and URL structure, with no dangerous operations or data leaks. Overall, the code is a benign URL utility module designed for legitimate URL processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe URL utility library with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.2) are consistent with its functionality. It can be considered benign, with potential misuse depending on how untrusted URLs are handled externally, but the code itself does not facilitate malicious activity.",
