  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious indicators. However, the presence of eval/exec and obfuscation in report #5 suggests a moderate potential for malicious activity. Slightly increasing the malware score to 0.5 and maintaining a high obfuscation score (0.7) provides a balanced, cautious assessment aligned with observed patterns."
