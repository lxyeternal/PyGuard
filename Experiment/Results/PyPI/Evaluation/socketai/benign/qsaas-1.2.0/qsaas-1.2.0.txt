      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client with some risky eval() usage but no malicious intent or malicious code detected. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The primary concern is the eval() pattern, which should be refactored for safer practice. The supply chain security is minimal, and the code appears benign."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious indicators. However, the presence of eval/exec and obfuscation in report #5 suggests a moderate potential for malicious activity. Slightly increasing the malware score to 0.5 and maintaining a high obfuscation score (0.7) provides a balanced, cautious assessment aligned with observed patterns."
