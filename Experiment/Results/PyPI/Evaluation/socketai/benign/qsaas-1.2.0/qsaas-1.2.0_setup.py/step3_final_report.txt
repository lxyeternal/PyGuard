{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers without executing any dynamic or malicious operations.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, static data in setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script that reads a README file and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. The dependencies are common for an API wrapper package. The code structure is conventional and transparent, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the absence of any security threats or malicious behavior.",
