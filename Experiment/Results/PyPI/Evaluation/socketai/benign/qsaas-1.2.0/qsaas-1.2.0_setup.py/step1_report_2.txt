  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'qsaas' Python library, which provides a wrapper for Qlik Sense Enterprise SaaS APIs.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no user input handling or data transmission within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads file content (README.md) -> uses static metadata for package setup. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools, reads a README file for long_description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All elements are standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The dependencies listed are common HTTP libraries, and the code does not handle user input, environment variables, or network communication within this file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
