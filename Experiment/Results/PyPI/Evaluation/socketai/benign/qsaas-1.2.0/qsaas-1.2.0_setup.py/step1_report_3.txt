{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'qsaas', intended to be published on PyPI, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "File reading 'README.md' for long_description; setup() function for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks related to untrusted data processing or external data output; no network or file writing operations observed.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> passing data to setup() as long_description; dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of common setup tools and dependencies is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file to include a long description, then calls setup() with standard package metadata and dependencies. All dependencies are typical for a Python package, with no indication of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The code does not contain network calls, code execution, or data leaks. The setup configuration aligns with common best practices for open-source Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
