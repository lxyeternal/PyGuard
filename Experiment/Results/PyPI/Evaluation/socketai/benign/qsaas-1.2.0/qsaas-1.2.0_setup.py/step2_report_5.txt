  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script.\n- No untrusted data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- Dependencies are common and appropriate for an API wrapper package.\n- The code structure and logic are straightforward and typical for packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports confirm that the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or flaws:** None identified. The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there is no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The code is a typical setup.py script with no hidden or malicious behavior.\n- The dependency list and code logic do not suggest any supply chain risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The code is safe and poses no security threat.",
