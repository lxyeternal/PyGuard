  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'qsaas' Python library, which wraps Qlik Sense Enterprise SaaS APIs.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, gathers package information, dependencies, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file output beyond package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> gathers package and metadata info -> prepares distribution package.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The dependencies are standard and the setup script follows typical pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It reads 'README.md' for long description, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code execution, no dynamic code, no user input handling, and no network activity. All elements are typical for Python package setup files. No anomalies, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears standard and benign. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The dependencies are common, and there are no signs of malicious intent.",
